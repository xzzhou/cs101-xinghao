You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?	Forget it.
There.	Where?
You have my word.  As a gentleman	You're sweet.
Sure have.	I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
Hi.	Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
Well, no#	Then that's all you had to say.
do you listen to this crap?	What crap?
Wow	Let's go.
She okay?	I hope so.
They do to!	They do not!
Did you change your hair?	No.
Where did he go?  He was just here.	Who?
Where've you been?	Nowhere# Hi, Daddy.
Joey never told you we went out, did he?	What?
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.	You did what?
You looked beautiful last night, you know.	So did you
Let go!	You set me up.
But she doesn't want to date.	Exactly my point
Daddy, I --	And where're you going?
Oh, God.  It's starting.	It's just a party. Daddy.
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.	Why?
You the new guy?	So they tell me#
What about him?	You wanna go out with him?
He's pretty!	Okay!  I wasn't sure
You told me that part already.	Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
What's the worst?	You get the girl.
Hey -- do you mind?	Not at all
Where ya goin?	Away.
Leave my sister alone.	And why would I do that?
Yeah	What do you think?
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.	Fine, thirty.
It's about time.	A deal's a deal.
How'd you do it?	Do what?
Hey.	Are you lost?
But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?	Does this conversation have a purpose?
You think this'll work?	No fear.
What'd he say?	Who cares?
Have you seen him?	Who?
Pick you up Friday, then	Oh, right.  Friday.
Excuse me?	That's what you want, isn't it?
Okay?	I'm fine. I'm
You're not okay.	I just need to lie down for awhile
Why'd you let him get to you?	Who?
When you were gone last year -- where were you?	Busy
I should do this.	Do what?
Oh, so now you think you know me?	I'm gettin' there
A soft side? Who knew?	Yeah, well, don't let it get out
You up for it?	For. . . ?
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.	Is that right?
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?	Hi.
You think?	Oh yeah.
Say it	What?
What?!	Good enough.
Have a great time, honey!	But -- who -- what --?
What are you listening to, chicken ass?	Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
He's the devil's child#	We'll all go crazy#
I could be gone for years.	I know.
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman#	I find that hard to believe.
She said yes.	Thank God#
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.	I don't want you to wait for me.
God# you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me#	They tried# but I didn't let them.
Can't you stay with us a little?	I am busy inside.
I want to go with you!	There'll be a time.
What are you listening to?	I am not listening, Father.  But I can't help hearing.
I want you to tell me everything you remember, Father.  From the beginning.  Everything.	Really?  God# I wouldn't know where to start# and yet#
No#	No?
You come!  You speak first!	Tell the Chief we thank him.
To bring the word of God.	Chief says -- he has a God.
God# That's in a week!	That's what it says.
May God forgive you#!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!	If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me#
I suppose we're both old men now.	You'll always be older than me, Father.
We can't raise the wheel without it.	My horse doesn't work.
What do you read?	Twenty eight.
Where can I meet this man?	Immediately.
Don't say anything.	Where are we going?
That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me.	Your father put cigarettes out on you?
I can't take you to my place.	Somewhere else?
Are you alright?	I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
Do you have coffee?	In the kitchen.
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.	#Do you really want me to forget about you?
I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.	C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.	If I tell you, will you arrest me?
Oh.	It was my decision, not his.
Only one guys checked in?	Yeah.
Are you hit?	No.  I'm okay.
Who's there?	Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
You know what that is, right?	No, what is it?
It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.	Watch the news?
I'll come with you.	There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
I'll let you know what happens.	This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
Two heads.	Better than one.
Why not?	Something back home?
Okay, tell you what, I'll give you a head start.  You take her to the station house.  Don't let her out of your sight. She's the only warm body we got left.	Hey.  I'm a professional.
Detective, does it look like a murder?	We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
Detective - can you tell us what happened here?	I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.
Eddie, are you okay?	Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
Hey, honey.	Hey.
Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it?	Could be Leon's.
Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.	Answer the phone.
Ready?	Keep them out of my way.
Any chance we can do that again?	Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.
Tell him to put his gun down!	Let her go!  Let her go!!
Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.	Okay.
Don't fool around.	Okay.
Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies!	Don't speak Russian!
Get in the bathroom!	Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!	Don't want to film this?
What is that?	What does it look like?  It's an address book!
Let me get a shot of it.	Sit down!
Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!	Cut!
In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?	The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.
I'm serious.	Shut up.  Look!
You got that?	No, I don't get that!
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.	Did you hurt her?
We spent it!	Ha. Ha.
I can get you a job.	A job?
Robert#?	What are you doing here?
I speak English.	Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
No.  Go ahead.	Thanks.  Appreciate it.
I'll take him.	No way!  He's mine!
Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?	Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
Mouth's clean, too.	Clean?
What?	There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.	Yeah?
How was it?	Not good.
Get outta here!	What the hell happened?
Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.	Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
Dave, if you've a minute, I'd like your advice on something.	Sure, what is it?
Not really. Though, it is strange when you think about it. It didn't really make any sense to keep us apart during training.	Yes, but it's to fantastic to think that they'd keep something from us.
Well, that's something.	Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.	He's got a point.
Too bad about Frank, isn't it?	Yes, it is.
I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?	I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
I'm having a party tomorrow.	Yes, I know that sweetheart.
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.	Thank you, Daddy.
Oh, thank you very much.	Thank you.
Are you sure you won't change your mind about a drink?	No, thank you# and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.	Are you quite sure?
Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I hope you don't mind me asking?	No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
Yeah?	I want to pick up my car.
This is three years old.	Yeah, I've been busy.
Now how's your memory doin'?	Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
I don't give a damn about his girl#	Look, give me a break, you're going to have to settle for her place.  It's the only thing I know.
I want to drive awhile.	I ain't tired yet.
You're in a hurry.	Yeah, i been waiting three years.
Well, maybe I'll see you later #	Here's hoping, baby#
I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.	Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls#	Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be#
You lying son of a bitch#	What are you talking about? We didn't kill her #
After I get outta this, cop#I'm gonna live forever#	I don't think you're gonna make it.
I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot.	You're done.  End of story.
Yeah.	It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
Hey, this works pretty good.	Thank you.
What do you think?	I think you better put him on ice, man.
Last night.	You have a good time?
I'll tell you what happens if you lose# you tell the truth for once.	What are you talkin' about?
There.	Must be billy's girl.
I been waiting a long time for some money.	How much?
Where's the goddamn car?	You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.	You stay with me#
That was quick.	When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
Sorry we didn't do better, Jack. I feel like I let you down.	Naw, you didn't let me down.  It was a long shot all the way.  We gave 'em a good run at it.
Do I get to kiss her too?	If she's right, and if you don't screw up.
You okay?	Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
You look awful.	So do you#been a long day.
Bullshit red tape.	I'm heading out. How about you?
I got to wait for a call.	Okay.  See you in the morning# you know, you ought to get some rest#
Jesus Christ.  Why the hell didn't you tell me before?	I'm not paid to take your personal calls.  He was in some bar. .. off duty.
What am I wanted for?	I don't answer questions, I ask 'em#
I'm all wet.	What's wrong with that?
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.	What'd you do?
Maybe you ought to buy me one.	Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
Yeah, Guess it must have been a slow news day#	Jack, are you okay?
I'm at work, asshole.  Where else?	Elaine! I# I'm sorry# I was expecting somebody else# police business.
The number # what's the Goddamn number?	Jack?  What was that?
Elaine, I gotta put you on hold#	Jack, wait#
Hello.	Hi, it's me#
Three more hours#	Where is he?
You're impossible#	That's what I always say.
Hard man to live with.	How would you know?
Hey#	Shut up.
What do you want?  What's goin' on?	Shut up.
Let her go.	First, the money.
How you doing, man?	Not bad, not bad.
You want to go outside?	Naw, right here's okay.
You sure?	I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?	Give it back.
#We're saved!	I'm fucked!
#would you like a drink?	No thank you.
Who are you?	I brought the girl remember?
He's a she!	You noticed#
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!	I might call to check up on her, you know# to see if she's better?
What are you doing?	Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
What are we going to do?	This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
They really made her#	Perfect.
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!	Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
Yeah?	Hey bud! Finger here.
I just found a picture of you.	How do I look?
Hello?	Hey bud#I'm waiting all day here.
I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?	I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
Yeah?	Have you pulled yourself together?
#Hi.	Does it get any better or what!
You don't do what I say# I'll waste you myself. Got it?	Got it#
Six to the left. One to the right.	He's on vacation.
You know how to fly this thing?	It's like a cab isn't it?
I don't even know what I'm looking for!	Fuck it! Hold tight!
What did you say? What did you do?	Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
#Shit!	What is it?
#Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.	Three of us will never fit in there!
I'm so very sad.	Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
Tell me#	I love you#
Not going to open?	I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
The cash man!	Been here long?
I want your best man on this!	Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
Is that better?	Perfect, Mr. President.
Welcome home.	Do you know how much I missed you?
What's this# have you been smoking# ?	Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
How's the detective business?	Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
I love you.	I love you.
What happened to you?	I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
Why haven't you called?  Why don't you answer your phone?	I don't know.  I'm sorry#
You should have.	Amy, I'm not going to let anything happen to us.
She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper#	I just talked to her.
What the fuck# !	I promised him to Machine.
It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.	What can I do for you today?
That's five thousand dollars.	Is it?
He might be interested# but it would mean another five thousand.	We can do that.
I'll do this for you.  Fifteen thousand dollars.	Machine's in?
You brought the money?	Right here.
Excellent.	Where are the women?
Empty the gun onto the table, very carefully.	Look, I don't know what this#
Friend of yours?	Look, he's got nothing to do with this# let him go#
You're a dead man.	Leave him alone.
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.	Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
Don't ask questions.	Fuck you!
Show me where you did it, on the map, exactly where you did it.	Why?
I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.	You enjoy it?
You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing#	Stop talking.
Do it.	Don't think I won't.
Give me the film.	You'll get it when we get there.
He's lying.	Look at him.  You think he played it square?  How much did he give you, how much did he keep for himself?
Big date tonight?	Yeah# guess so.
I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.	Good for you.
How long you been working there?	Three, four years.
How old are you?	Twenty-five.
It's a film# of a girl being murdered.	I'm afraid I don't#
You# you need to go to the police.	I told you I can't, not yet.
Hello# ?	I'm here.
People remember me from the news.  Can you drive me back now?	Of course.
I# I shouldn't take anymore of your time.  Maybe we can finish tomorrow.  I'll call tomorrow#	Okay.
How# how can you say that to me#?	Will you let me look?
You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?	Yes.
Yes# I remember Mary	You# you do?  You're sure? Please, Sister, will you take another look, make sure#
Alright.  May I have your phone number, area code first?	No, you may not.
Rick#I can't.	Never say can't.  Just do what I do.
Alice, you think you can leave?	What's wrong?
I heard you screaming.  Was it a bad one?	It was bad.
We'll figure it out.	Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.	You could do worse.
You've been up all night?	That obvious, huh?
No#	You're his sister, right?
I was there in the dream.  He took her. It was awful.  It was awful#	"In her dream"?
How long have you been awake?	Three days.
Not really.	Is there something we can do?
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.	It's okay, we're just about there.
Here we are.	Something's wrong here.  It feels like#
You look great!	Save it for later.  Come on!
Hey, Rick!	Excuse me, ladies.  I'll just be a moment.
I don't get it.	Let me talk to you.
Hey man, we're all sorry#	She knew she was gonna die.
Been up with Alice.	How she doing?  I ran into her last night.
What is it?	Oh God!  He killed them!
I'll tell you later.	It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me#to dream.
Feeling better now?	Yeah.  I guess so# What happened?
I gotta get out of here.	You just stay put.  You need rest.
Hey#wake up.	Huh?
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.	How did you know that?
Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?	Been having bad dreams.
Is that who you're waiting for?	No#
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.	She doesn't want me around
No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?	Who said I#wait, what?
Who says I don't like you?	My friend, with the funny hand.
Mommy#?	Come on downstairs.  He won't hurt you. He needs us both.
Hi, beautiful.	Jesus!  Don't do that!
About him?	No.  Well, not exactly#it's that#I felt like I wasn't in control.  For the first time since#all that.  I'm scared.
You stopped it didn't you?  It was probably just a regular bad dream.	Yeah#I guess.
Where are we going?	To take a picture.
Thanks for everything, Dad.	You sure you don't want a ride to work?
Alice!	I've got to go.
Did everyone call everyone?	They're waiting for us#but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
Oh, Alice#no.  Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself#	Mark knows I'm not crazy.  Ask him to show you his hands.
I really think you need to calm down now, okay?	I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake#
Look#we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night#	That's the only reason you're alive#
Are you alright?	Yeah#So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
He sure loves to stay awake.	That's okay.  He's got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.	Well we gotta do something!
Then get out!	Mark!
Do you think I'm an idiot#for being in love with her?	Nobody thinks that.
Whoa, slow down.  How're you gonna hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?	I don't know!
They think I'm nuts.	That's their problem.
Poor woman#	No shit.
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.	I want to talk about the baby.
It's okay.	Stick around, please?
You, too?	He invited me to his house last night.
You all wait here.  I'm going inside, take a look.	Not alone, you're not!
Yeah?	Listen!  Hear that?
And if I didn't know better - I'd swear we were moving!	Let's get back to work, and maybe we will be, soon.
You hear that?	The sound again?
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?	Somewhere down there?
Well?	I'm with you!
Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.	Oh it does???
Is there any way out of it?	Seems to be all around#
Right at him?	That's what I said!
Well, I'll be - !	I'll be another!
We've asked ourselves that - over and over - a thousand times.	But answers are what we need - not more questions!
What are you boys up to?	Same old shit.
The good news is we haven't got to your car yet. The bad news --	Just tell me when you'll have it fixed.
He's on to us!	Shit! What are we gonna do?
I used to play ball.	Yeah?
Safety on?	Yeah.
Open the door, will ya?	Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
Why do they do that?	Do what?
She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.	Yes.
Dad.	I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
Are we going in this?	Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
How about a Big Mac?	Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
Please don't cry. Please, honey.	What are you sorry for?
How you holding up, Wade?	I'm fine, fine.
You okay?	Yeah.
You don't mean that.	Yeah. I mean that.
Call me.	Tonight. Let's get together.
Money.	Jack doesn't need money.
I can see what you looked like as a kid.	You knew me as a kid.
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?	The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
Strange.	Think they're alright?
This is nuts.	Wade.
It makes me sad.	Can --?
Take care, Wade.	You be careful of that little bastard. He's dying to get in your pants, you know.
It don't look right.	What?
What was that?  You got something to say, say it! Say it!	Nothing.
Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold, dressed like that? Where's Ma?	Sleeping.
Where's Ma?	She's coming.
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.	Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
Pop, for Christ's sake!	You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
Love! What the fuck do you know about love?	Love! I'm made of love!
I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.	For what?
It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times.	Well, you aren't the President, dear.
You don't want to say hi to your father?	I'm sure he's busy.
Mom?	Yes dear?
I don't drink coffee.	You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
The woman you shot. She was my friend.	That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
Alice!	Daddy#
Daddy#	Alice# I#
Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.	You read my mind.
Who's flying the fucking plane?	I'm doing what I can.
He's dead then. They must have killed him.	We don't know that.
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?	To swear you in as President.
The rest of the secret service?	Dead.
The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.	Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
Four#	Jim#
Stop.	You'll do it?
There goes your ride.	Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
I'll not going without my family.	Yes, sir.
Sir, we stay with the President.	That isn't necessary.
May I speak to you for a moment?	Can't it wait?
You know what?	What?
I don't know why you stayed.	Please# don't start with me.
What are you doing?	Flying the plane.
Where are we sending it?	White House Situation room.
Someone should give you a raise.	Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
What's going on?	We're under attack.
One.	But#
Okay# if you're the President, when's your wife's birthday?	Look lady, I don't have time for games. Just put the#.
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?	I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
What?	I just wish it was that simple.
Forget it.  I was reading.	I was reading too.
Did you feel that?	Yes I did#
Elaine.	Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.
Ted!  What are you#?	I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight.
Ted, we're taking off!	Let me by, Elaine.
Ted.	Not now, Elaine!
Elaine.	Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
Elaine!	Ted!
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.	Not now, Elaine.
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.	I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
Are you afraid?	Not when I'm with you, Ted.
Roger.	You can do it from up here, Captain.
Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people.	I don't want to live anymore.
You can't go in there!	Don't try to stop me!
Excuse me, are you alright?  I noticed you talking to yourself.  I'm a nurse.  Can I be of some help?	Uh# oh, thank you.  It's nothing.
You've been hurt.	I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
Ah, won't you sit down?	Thank you. Cream?
I'm sure we'll both make it#but just in case one of us#well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?	No. I'm all alone.
Captain, how soon can we land?	I can't tell.
Can't you take a guess?	Well#not for another two hours.
Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?	That's right.
You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.	A hospital? What is it?
What did he have?	He had fish.
No. No one that I know of.	I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.
Elaine!	Ted!
Ted, what are you doing here?	Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!	That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
Rain.	And a little ice.
Ted#	Yes?
See them, Elaine?	Uh-huh.
We'd better get back now.	Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.	Who wants to be first?
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.	You promise you'll write.
Oh, I can't stand it.	What is it?
How ya doing, honey?	Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?	I will, but Jim won't.
Roger.	Huh?
Roger.	Huh?
Excuse me, Sister?	Yes?
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?	No. No thank you.
You okay?	Yeah#
He's not here.  Why ask me?	The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
In there.	Show me.
Kill them both.	Here?
Look, you want to fit in here, right?  You want to learn how to get along?	Yes.
What's this?  What's going on?	Nothing.
Why did you do it?	Why'd I do what?
Who said that?	At the end of the bar.
Screw you.	Screw me?  That can't be right.
I'm going home.	Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?
Well, let's roll, George.	To the# to the beach?
Stop the car.	Why?
What was that about?	Nothing.
Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart.	If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
Uh, George#	Where is the drug?  Where have they taken it?
What's this about, George?  I know that look.	There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
No!  We must do this alone.	Do what?!  George-- ?!
How do I look?	You look very good.
You said you wanted the biggest thing I could find# Well, this is it.	What is it?
Get outta there!	I can't!  Do you mind!
I'll go.	What?
It's going to be closer.  You better get going.	See you soon.
No.  There's no way!	Hear me out#
What is it?	I don't know.
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!	Shut up.  Just shut up!
I told them to fall back#	They're but off!  Do something!
We're not making that out too well.  What is it?	You tell me.  I only work here.
Well that's great!  That's just fucking great, man.  Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!	Are you finished?  You okay?
We got problems.	I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
The corner!  Ready?	Do it!
Let's go!  Let's go!	Fuckin' A!
They'll get us.	Maybe.  Maybe not.
Locked.	Stand back.
No!  No!  She's alive!  We have to --	All right!  She's alive.  I believe it.  But we gotta get moving!  Now!
Ellen.	Don't be long, Ellen.
Thanks.	Uh, what's next?
They cut the power.	What do you mean, they cut the power?  How could they cut the power, man?  They're animals.
And how are we today?	Terrible.
I don't want you for a friend.	Why not?
They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would.	They're dead.
Yes, there are, aren't there.	Why do they tell little kids that?
Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.	Did one of those things grow inside her?
Mommy#Mommy?	Right here, baby.  Right here.
Are we going to sleep now?	That's right.
Oh. Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway.	Perhaps.
Did you know? Had you heard?	What?
Oh - excuse me!	Is her mother still lying on the floor?
Is she a good fuck?	What??
What is it?	I want to go!
No! No! No!	Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
I think you're mad! You're really mad!	Oh, leave me alone.
There's a young girl to see you.	What does she want?
You're not going to do this?	Why not? Half the house!
Who was that?	No one.
No. Don't answer it!	Why?
Give me one reason I can understand.	I can't write it!
Go back to bed.	Please! Let me sit here. Let me stay here with you. I promise I won't say all word. I'll just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you. Please, please!
Come back tonight.	Tonight?
I see that you're expecting.	Oh, yes.
And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.	And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
Be careful!	Be careful!
Hey!	Hey!
I said play!	Michael!
What a strange young man.	Yes. He is a little strange.
Really?	Ah, now! Here she comes.
Just one year.	Who was your teacher?
An interesting idea, Majesty. But -	Yes?
Yes, sir.	Well. There it is.
Why are you here?	Am I not welcome?
What's that?	Oh, let's not talk about it.
Are you playing a trick on me?	I never saw this girl in my life.  Is this a kind of joke?
I think I've found out about the money, sir.	Yes what?
Where does he work?	In there, sir.
Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?	I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
I'm afraid I am.	Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?
I'm sorry. No.	Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
How long will you give me?	Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.
What happened? Is it over?	I'm taking you home. You're not well.
Shall I answer it?	No! No, it's him!
Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it.	Finish what?
Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?	Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
The Fire.	What time?
Do you have me?	I think so.
And that's it. Do you have it?	You go fast!
Do you want to rest a bit?	Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
You mean that play?	Exactly.
That lady is back, sir.	Show her in. Then go to bed.
Oh, Miss Price?	Yes, Doctor?
It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.	Come to my office, Miss Price.
You've absolutely no idea where David might be?	No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.
He's here.	Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
Could you get here without any trouble?	Yes, I should think so.
What shall we do?	Tea would be nice.
Aw come on, Miss Price!	Call me Alex.
Call me David.	Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
You're a very beautiful girl.	I thought you were asleep.
What do you dream about?	I dream of death mostly.
Hello. You all right?	I'm sorry I woke you up.
Are you better now?	I'll let you know the next full moon.
My friend Jack was just here.	Your dead friend Jack?
The kitchen.	Very nice.
It's nice to see you.	It's nice to see you.
Alex?	Yes?
But#	Pull over.
I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I#	Jack is dead!
He's playing a stupid joke, sir.	What?
Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and#	Will you shut up!?!!
Feeling better?	No.
How are we feeling tonight?	No.
He all right?	Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
Officer, I killed those people last night.	You did, did you?
All right, you two, move along.	Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!	You could have told them!
Miss Price! Miss Price, please!	Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
Are you cold?	Yes.
Jack.	David.
Hello.	Nice to see you.
Nice looking group.	Listen, at least it's warm in here.
Go on, ask them.	You ask them.
Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!	Apparently so.
What do you think was wrong?	I have no idea.
Did you hear that?	I heard that.
Could be a lot of things.	Yeah?
Shit! David, what is that?	I don't know. Come on.
What's the plan?	Plan?
It's in front of us.	Do you think it's a dog?
See anything?	No.
It sounds far away.	Not far enough. Come on.
Jack?	Yeah.
Nice to see you.	Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
I'm going completely crazy.	David!
It's you, David.	What?!
You're not real.	Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.
What are you doing here?	I wanted to see you.
Hi, Jack.	Hi, David.
What can I say, Jack?	You don't have to say anything.
Because this must be stopped.	How shall I do it?
No, thank you.	I'd like some tea, please.
Hello, Tom.	You here again? What do you want?
What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!	Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?	Yeah.
Whose death?	It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
We want to talk to you.	What about?
We'll be forced to shut the doors. I've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive. You've all made money out of it. Are you willing to help?	What do you mean, help?
That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.	Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
Stand back Inspector, or I'll shoot. Drop that gun.	All right, Jack, all right.
What do you mean?	All you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we'll do the rest, see?
What?	Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
What's this?	My apartment.
Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you.	I'm listening.
Shall we let the people come in?	Of course, let them in! You're late now.
Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.	Hello, darling.
What's the matter dear? What have I done now?	Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
Listen, dear. I want to ask you something. I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night?	Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
Longer.	I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
It's all right. Thanks.	And what's more, keep up the good work and who knows - some day you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk . . .  Not a bad thought, eh?
I already told him I was home.	There you are.
My wife? What's she got to do with you?	No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
We can't keep open till four o'clock. We haven't cash enough to last an hour.	Don't you think I know it?
Quiet down, please! Take it easy, folks. Everything will be all right.	But you said it would be safe! It's his life insurance money. Oh, please, I'll go to the Old Ladies' Home if you don't do something, please!
What did you do with it?	With what?
No.	Oh, you think I'm lying?
What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?	Yeah.
What's keeping you?	Oh, Charlie again.
What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?	Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
Did you talk to him?	Yeah.  I got an idea. Come on, let's get to a telephone.
What time was it?	Huh?
Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause#	It couldn't have been earlier?
Then who changed it?	I don't know.
So you were home last night?	Yes.
Everybody in?	I guess so.
Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie!	They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste any time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. Step on it.
Your Ma wouldn't let us leave until we ate something.	That was two hours ago.
How'd they --	What have you done?
Bob. I didn't#	Swear.
I'm sorry, Cole.	You're just upset about Jesse. We all are.
How many of them did he kill?	Two.
You have no shame.	Not yet. But I'm hoping.
Beg pardon?	You heard me, Jesse. You know how crazy I get!
The things a fella has to do to get a little respect around here#	You are a fine figure of a man.
You shut up now, boy.	No, really. You're wife said she needed some help, seeing as you were so fat you couldn't find your --
'Bout time you got here, buddy.	What's going on?
Ride with me, cousin?	I could use the walk.
Not now.	What is wrong with you?
Thanks for the help.	After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
I got seven thousand.	I got three.
Jesse, we got to have a word.	Sure, cousin.
Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.	If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
Beautiful.	Now the one time one of us comes up with an idea --
We'll make them pay for this.	I'm out.
Missed you, cousin.	Missed you too, cousin.
I think one of 'em's glass.	Which one, right or left?
The safe. Now.	Of course!  Uh, sir?
What the --	What is it?
Where the hell were you?	I had you covered.  From back there.
Frank, don't you have something to say?	You're doing just fine.
That just might work.	Maybe, maybe#
"Big and older"?	You can shut up now.
You know him?	Heard of him.
How'd it go in there?	Fine. How'd it go out here?
We're drunk.	Oh yeah.
Y'know, Uncle Frank#	Yeah, Jimmy?
Uncle Frank?	Yeah Jimmy?
Ma! Please!	Boys?
You shouldn't be up.	I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
I used to come to this tree when I was a kid and imagine what my life would be like when I got older.	You didn't want to farm?
I am so sorry, Jesse.	Frank and me have to go away for a while.
You and I, we've started# something, you know?  I don't know what'll happen if you do this.	Me neither.
I don't understand.	She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
Hmm.	"Hmm" what?
Don't turn around.	What?
Oh. That's nice to know.  We're going to hang you, you know.	I figured.
That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else.	He's too important, James.  They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.
Now let's have a drink.	Right here in church?
And you're too young.	I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
I like that.	No.
Well, not exactly.	You been with a girl ever?
Why, yeah.	I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
Really?	I hope I'm not being too forward.
With my money!	We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!
This is him.	I remember you.
You wouldn't have done that?	Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.
So he's won.	No.
Listen, what are you doing tonight?	What? Oh, I'm#busy.
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?	Oh God, just get it over with.
I haven't seen you around here.	You just haven't been looking.
I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time#	Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise.
Nothing like last time, promise.	Alright.
You're really serious, aren't you?	Yes, I am.
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.	Oh God, I can't believe this.
Where are you going?	I'm just leaving.
Are you my two o'clock?	No.
Doesn't he live here?	No, he doesn't.
I think you should go now.	But I think#I want to know what happened here.
Don't come back.	I won't#don't worry.
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?	What exactly do you mean?
What#is#it?	Where are you going?
SHUT UP!	Calm down. Let's do it anyway
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.	Leaving what?
Oh? And what should I say?	Just#say#no.
That is#if you're not doing anything.	Oh no. I have no plans.
Anywhere you want?	Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
Yes? You're dressed#okay.	You didn't give them a name.
Do you have a boyfriend?	No, not really.
#to the office this afternoon.	Why?
So, what do you do?	What do you think I do?
Well.	Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best.
She's my#cousin.	Uh huh?
Pardon me, but are you okay?	Who do you ask?
Would you rather I not smoke?	No, I guess it's okay.
He does? You're sure?	I checked it out. It's clean.
I'm so hungry.	It's cold out, too, isn't it?
Gee, uh, that's too bad.	I'm so hungry.
Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?	I'm not#
That took some fun out of --	We're not gonna let it.
To our new life.  #What's wrong?	That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.	What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
He's your boss. He's not your --	I know, I know.
It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there?	Nothing.
The Justice Department guy who came to the apartment when --	I remember.
That was -- different.	#Different?
Look at this.	What?
Great!	Look at me! I'm gonna change.
You look beautiful.	Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
Here we go.	Great.
What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.	I am. I am, sir.
Cool!	Would you like a Coke or something?
How's it going?	Maybe I'm going too fast.
Ready for number three?	Let's go.
I think you should go.	You do?
Come with me.	Where we going?
Did you wanna be alone?	No. Please.
That's great. I -- didn't know.	She saved my life.
How close are you?	What?
#He knows.	What?
Maybe he'll get back to work.	Speaking of which#
That kid's the great white hope.	I could get it out of him.
Who're these guys?	Where is he?
You seem surprised to see me.	I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
Come in.	I'd rather talk about Number Two.
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?	Is it about my teeth?
She's working on another lead right now.	Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
I haven't had fun like that since college.	I'm sorry.
Not a good time to lose one's head.	Indeed.
I have something to tell you.	Lay it on me.
Everything seems to be in order.	Hey, wait a minute--
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.	No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
But Scott, who's going to take over the world when I die?	Not me.
Don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? A million dollars isn't that much money these days.	All right then#  #FIVE MILLION DOLLARS!
I'm proud of you.	Why?
No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.	I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
So, Scott, why don't we start with you. Why are you here?	Well, it's kind of weird.
I just think, like, he hates me. I really think he wants to kill me.	OK, Scott, no one really wants to "kill" anyone here. They say it, but they don't mean it.
I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand # ?  Blue #	# bottle #
How long have I been here?	Three days.
You	Have we met?
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.	Promised? Who promised?
You are female?	As you see.
Your voice -- it's so familiar #	We have met #
How curious #	Something strange is happening. And whoever knows about it doesn't want us to find out.
What are you trying to do to me?	We want to help#!
What on earth?	Any ideas?
But	Don't bother.  Here's a bus #
Not quite. This is my field.	Is there anything that isn't?
You followed me.	Orders.
I could save you the trouble.	No trouble.
But you did suspect me.	Not for a moment.
No, after you.	You don't trust me?
I told Mother I took care of you.	You lied.
Aren't you coming?	I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
I'll be back #	Where are you going?
I was getting to it.	Getting to what?
Are you alright, young man?	I think so, thank you so much #
You with Mother or Father?	Both, actually.
You said # one shot.	Did I? My mistake.
Does Cole know about this?	Really -- you went with him for two years.
What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?	They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.
What?	You're kidding.
Man, you're losing your audience.	Okay# This is it# I'm getting married.
All right!	When do the girls get to the party?
I don't want any trouble.	Oh, come on, just a little.
Great car.	The best.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!	Maybe it had something to do.
Cole, what the hell are you doing?	She's mine!
Nice shot.	Thank you, sir.
So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?	What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
That feels so great.	Good#
This is it, lady. Last stop.	Can't I just go with you guys?
I can't trust you!	C'mon, I knew it was you.
I don't believe you.	You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
Are you okay?	Yeah.
Let's go.	Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!
Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.	Any time, Al.
Give him the works.	That's more like it.
Let's go.	Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
So, Larry, how have you been?	Just in love with everybody. It's really a beautiful planet. I love you, Rick. I love you guys. I love everybody.
Is that all the coke in the place?	That's it.
Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.	C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
You okay?	Yeah, I guess so.
Are any of those right?	This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
Welcome, welcome, one and all.	Rick!
Er# perhaps we ought to stop now.	No. Let's at least finish the set.
Where the hell is he?	Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.
What's the matter?	Nothing# Let's get crazy!
What the hell is that?	My gift to you.
I think you'll enjoy this table.	So long, Father.
Rick, I'm concerned.	About what?
Who was that?	I don't know.
He look familiar?	Very.
Now, don't get into any trouble.	Take care.
Hey, you guys#	Who's your friend?
Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.	Who?
I don't know# Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.	You got it.
Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.	Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
You're late again, Rick.	I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
-- Knock it off!	-- You can't let him turn you against your friends, man --
Is he#	He's alive.
You gotta let me finish --	Just come down, John. Just --
It doesn't go like that.	Who asked you?
I like what you've done with the place.	It's comin' along# want a beer?
Hey.	Hey.
You okay?	I waited# I would have fucking waited#
Hey, what are you doing here?	Just# Just wanted to say hello#
I saw it.	Saw what?
Anything else?	What are we going to do about this?
Hey.	How's it going?
I could use a date.	Yeah? Well, maybe I can fit it in#
Hi.	Hi.
What is --	Just take it.
I'm sorry.	That's a dumb thing to say.
I'm close# but I can't get who it is#	So you came to me#  Well, this is going to be an interesting afternoon after all#
Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?	Who's doing this?
Are you still here?	Get used to me, Inspector. I'm not going anywhere.
-- Shhh.	What are you listening to?
That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh? Our killer doesn't love fire!	What?
Did you pull me out?	Yeah.
Your brother was a good man.	Yeah.
'Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?	Four months.
Oh, man, I'm sorry.	You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.
Completely out of control.	What the hell are we waiting for?
You can't talk about my brother like that#	Here we go#
You want some coffee?	Coffee? Nah, I gotta go.
I'm sorry# I# couldn't sleep#	What's wrong?
You don't know him.	I know you.
-- Burn them.	And old ladies?
I'm a little busy right now --	This'll only take a minute. There's two cops outside that want to ask you about this --
Are you all right, honey?	I was gonna bring it back myself.
I forgive you.	Me?
I forgive you.	Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me!  Hate me! Help me! Hate me!
Large?	All right, cop. I want my money.
Oh, really?	Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop!
OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?	I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
Do you have the money?	What money?
How's the case going?	What case?
Keep trying.	I'm on it.
You truly are a dancing fool.	Yo Black, you looking for trouble.
What's wrong with him?	Must be the pressure.
What kind of show is this gonna be?	Different.
I would like to change your name.	To what?
What do you want?	I want to speak with you.
Enough about me, what's happening with you?	The same old, same old.  Trying to get my stuff through.
How long has my father been like this?	Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.	Your father is proud of you.
This is the group I was telling you about.	Which one is your brother?
Just want to say good luck.	Break a leg.
Your life will never be the same.	Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
Same here.	The pleasure is mine.
Who's side are you on?	I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny.
What is this?	A gift.
Why'd you do that?	I don't want to hear it.
This is crazy.	That's why it will be so much fun.
Can I kiss you too?	Naw.  I'll take the zero.
No joke.  Serious.	Hope the same thing doesn't happen to me.  That's some big shoes to fill.
He wants you to come and see him.	He said that?
Nice to meet you.  If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?	I just turned twenty.
I feel a song a comin' on.	A song a comin' I feel.
A lot?	Enough.
So what's up with you?	What do you want to know?
Why don't you call him?	For what?  He left.  Not me.
You're sure this is a good idea.	My people love me.
I'll be down front.  You better start putting your face on.	Y'know what?
Good day to you, young sir.	Good morning.
No.	Have you had one?
Then this must be done tomorrow.	What is to be done?
Can I at least have a drink?	It's ten thirty in the morning.
Don't you ever point a gun at me!	I'm -- I'm sorry#
Fuck, what the fuck is going on --	What do we do?
I don't want to go --	Fine.
This isn't our area. Whose area is this --	Can anybody hear me!
Hey, I --  Holy fuck# holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?	We found him like this --
Holy fuck# Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?	We found him like this#
Yeah, right#	Shut up.  West's dead.
There's no need#	They're dead, aren't they?
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?	I'm not telling you what happened.
Some.	Tell me about them.
I apologize --	You saw West's body.
And he'd been shot.	Yeah --
We're not finished yet --	You wanna bet?
We don't need the tapes --	Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
He -- He made me do it --	Do what?
Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?	Would you have believed me?
What the fuck is going on?	Your weapons, Sergeant.
Jesus, what happened?	West# he's dead.
So you killed him?	I#
What do you mean, West's?	I mean I killed him.  Isn't that what we all wanted?
You know it's not like that --	Do I?
Right?	Yeah#
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.	You saw West, right? How was he killed?
Way I figure it, West must have found out about their little business and was gonna bust them, so they decided to get rid of him first#	They?
I# I don't know#	What don't you know?
Maybe I shouldn't tell you that. Maybe I should tell you I wasn't scared at all. But I was#  Enough to almost kill him.	But you didn't.
Is it the truth?	There's that word again.  As I told you, I wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting.
I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?"	Well?
Why?	Because of what I saw.  Who really killed West.
How do you know?	Because I was standing next to him.
How are you?	Been better.  I read about what's been happening with you# I should have called --
That bad?	Would I have called you if it wasn't? If there was any other way --
Tom, where are you going --	Home, I'm done.
They're taking your command, aren't they?	The Senator#
I'm sorry, Bill.	Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
Ah, Christ	You knew Sergeant West?
Gotta be honest, I love what you've done with the place --	You and the Colonel go back.
You're kidding.	Yeah. That's just the story I tell the girls to get them into bed. Truth is# I don't know. The whole honor and duty thing. Make a difference in the world, crap like that. Didn't really work out.
But we have to question him --  Thought you didn't have cigarettes --	I lied. Wait for it#
I didn't shoot West#	What?
We're fucked, I know --	They got their stories straight.
You wanted to break him.	Yeah.
So what now?	Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Four --	Get in.
We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.	Right back where we started.
We need to talk --	Seven.
What?	Seven guys. What was it you said? You were "just starting to believe I wasn't the guy people said".
West?	Nobody saw. But I don't think so.
Do I have a choice in this?	Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.
What are you doing out here?	Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.	I should probably write that down.
He was your friend.	Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks.
The thing is, we've got a real opportunity here. You turn me in tomorrow and we're both fucked --	What are you talking about?
He couldn't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own.	He wanted more than that.
Enjoy your flight to Washington --	Wait --
What the fuck happened to you --	What the fuck happened to you? One minute you're next to me and the next you're gone and the sky lights up like fucking Christmas --
Thank God#	What the fuck are you doing?
You think he did it?	No --
You both know if you do this, if you go after a Senator's son and you're wrong# it's not just me in the hot seat anymore.	We know.
Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star.	That's great.
See! The big guy likes it.	I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.
I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl.	There's only one I want.
You were expecting me?	Not yet.
I have to leave. Tonight.	Why?
You won't find a better place!	I don't expect to.
Or are you too scared?	I'll go in right now and get that eye.
You get the eye?	I brought it.
Can I see him?	Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.
How long have you known my father?	Thirty years. Maybe more.
Did you see that woman?	What did she look like?
How are you gonna make it without your shoes?	I suspect it will hurt a lot.
It's okay, just leave it.	I can get it. I can just#
Lord, I'm sorry I#	Please. Go. Just go.
There was one time when I was eleven#	You were talking about your wedding.
Okay.	Okay.
You're not trying to run away?	Just to be sure, you can take my pack.
You --  -- are in for a surprise.	Am I?
People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go.	Really.
When did you ever work in an office?	There's a lot you don't know about me.
Dad, I'm hoping we can talk about some things while I'm here.	You mean, while I'm here.
Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. If you wanted to you could#	I will.
I thought you weren't dying.	I said this isn't how I go. The last part is much more unusual. Trust me on that.
Did I ever tell you about how#	Yes.
But the real story is how I got the car. You see#	Dad?
What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be?	Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
The river.	The river?
Tell me how it happens.	How what happens?
I can try, Dad. If you help. Just tell me how it starts.	Like this.
Let's get out of here.	Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say#
You become what you always were. A very big fish.  And that's the way it happens.	Yes. Exactly.
You don't even know me.	I have the rest of my life to find out.
Oh. Oh.	Hello.
Thank you. I'll bet you need to --	Yes.
I'm going to check on him.	I need to lie down for a bit.
Do you like it, being pregnant?	I do.
I'm going with you.	You don't have to.
I talked with your father last night.	Did you?
Look, I know why you like him. I know why everyone likes him. But I need you to tell me I'm not crazy.	You're not.
Mom, would you say you understand Dad?	Of course.
Mom?	Yes?
Mom, do you want some time with Dad?	Yes. Thank you.
You first.	Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
It's enough isn't it?	What do you mean?
Do you like it?	Yeah.
Say thank you.	Thank you.
A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby?	Name it.
What? What are you doing?	What are you doing here?
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?	Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
Sorry. You've lost me#	I'm asking what you're here for.
What did he say?	He says he feels safe here.
I need to know who you are first please.	Oh.  We are Russian.
What was that?	I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.
She says she has a secret to tell.	What?
What was that?	Oh nothing.
How is bank?	Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
I understand. I'm so sorry	You can stay tonight.
He wants a lot of money.	I'll give him money. Tell him to put the#
Oh Jesus.	He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
Just leave her alone.	I'm so sorry.
Is that everything?	Yes.
And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you?	Yes.
Do uh# Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?	Yes.
They go. John. They go.	What's wrong?
Give me some money.	I don't have any money.
What?	I said I don't have any.
So uh#	Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
I don't want to talk about it.	Why not?
What?	You#
It wasn't what I wanted.	So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?
Excuse me?	Get out
Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?	No.
I'm sorry.	I don't know why I said that. She's not dead at all.
What?	I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
She's alive!! She is not dead?	Laugh it up.
I don't know.	What was her name?
I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?	No. I think I better just go.
Yeah. No thanks.	Please. Why not?
Okay. Goodbye.	Goodbye.
Something else.	Okay. Promise?
It's not mine.	It's not mine either.
Why?	I'm not asking you to marry me.
What does it mean?	Maybe you will find out.
Hurry. I'll wait for you here.	Right.
Is the flight full?	I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
You have excellent English.	Thanks.
What are you doing?	Just wanted to see.
This was very sweet of you.	Well. Hope you enjoy it.
Hi.	Hey.
Look it. I got somethin' for us. This is gonna help, okay.	You gonna miss your bus.
Holy shit.	Yeah.
You gonna steal my truck?	Make yourself at home. You done it already.
Better?	Yeah.
God forgive you, for how you done me#	Let go#
YOU SHUT UP!	Careful how you point that gun, boy.

Now you get up! And you get in my house!	Or what?
You take it straight?	Sure.
If you want# I can take you back to town now.	I ain't in a hurry.
Could you do somethin' for me?	Anything.
Where you gonna be?	Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?
You took care of your wife, like you do me?	I tried.
What is it?	Nothin'.
Sorry.	Looks like you know a song.
I don't want you to let go.	Maybe I won't.
How a girl get like that?	Like I told you.
You get a call from Rose?	This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now.
You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. I got my mind made up and I ain't gonna be moved on this.	Ain't gonna be moved?
Are you outta ya GODDAMN MIND?	Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
Heard about this morning.	We ain't here to talk about that shit.
Hey.	Hey.
I think it'd be better if you talk to me.	Yeah?
I feel better. Do you?	Yeah, I do.
What happened to your face?	Got in a little accident.
You got any money?	Thought you had a man for that.
# It's not like you were slow or anything# I think you did just fine.  I think you did great.	Thanks.
Hey, hey, where you goin'?	Home.
What's this?	Let go#
Charlie, don't do anything.  Promise me?	What?
Some party.	Maybe we should do something?
Nick# You up?	No.
Nick, have I been a good partner?	Number five with a bullet.
I just want you to know# I mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me.	Go to sleep, Charlie.
Let's go.	Nick, we can't just --
This should be it#	You said that in the last two places.
This the right place?	I hope not.
Getting very weird.	I'd feel better if we had some heat.
It's incredible.  Hit him or something.	I don't think he'd feel it.
# He's a sorry old guy, but I like him.	He couldn't find his ass with both hands.
Are you expecting anyone?	I wasn't expecting you.
# We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!	What's the problem here?
Nick!	Give us a break#
You must leave?	Yeah#
How'd you get this?	I stole them.
Know her?	We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to#
What's he saying?	He says they're very nice.  He wants to know if you have anymore.
What'd I tell you?	There she is!
Nick#	If you're gonna give me a hard time, wait outside.
It's very small.	Big enough.
No#	Let's go.  Him first.
Start it.	I can't#
I was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.	I followed them.  An hour from the train station.
Thank you.  You have one?	A wife.  She left.
What's that for?	Luck.
You know, Nick, we can't lose.	Why's that?
You all right?	Yes#
Think we'll get him, Nick?	We can't lose.
Don't give him any more.	He gets as much as he wants.
Don't be an ass.	He's on duty.
Where's the wife?	You met her.
Can't make you change your mind?	Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head.
Keep the change.	I'm taking you back.
One guy do all the damage?	Yeah.
It's not your job.	He was my partner.
I want a gun.	It is not allowed.
Could you fill me in?	Why don't you ask your chief detective?
Because I want you to tell me.	The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.
That wasn't our deal.	You want him dead too.
We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.	You certainly have a nice place here.
Let's go while there is still time.	Where?
One man.  He must be good.	Then go get him.
How about breakfast, I was just going to make some.	If it wouldn't be too much of a bother# a little bite to eat would be#
Show me something?	Like what?
We have a lot in common.	You mean that you can't come here and I can't go there?
You're our best and only friend.	Thank you.
What's going on down there?	He's not ready yet.
Then we're stupid and we'll die.	Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home?
I didn't like her.	You didn't like her!?
Well, when do you get paid?	Soon as I finish the job.
Yes?	Do you have something against science?
I think I have no money.	It's okay.  Forget it.
You want to see my friends?	Sorry, don't have the time.
How long you had these guys?	Two months.  But this one is not guy.  It is girl.  His girl.
You like to kiss her goodbye.	No thanks.
I like you.	I like you too.
How old am I?	I don't know.
What's that?	I'm taking a piss.
During the road test#	Yeah?
Why didn't you go?	Too old.
My job is here.	Me too.
I'd like  you to take a look at these pictures.	Of course.
This one looks familiar, but I don't know.  Naw.  There's one came in today looks a little like this one but#	What did she want?
The best.	Does it eat?
Me.	And who do I go to about you?
You use your equipment, don't you?	So?
Do I make you nervous?	Yeah.
I can imagine.	Can you?  I couldn't.
They probably want to find out when they were made.	Right.
I told you I'd come back.	You did?
Who is this?	Me and my dad.
Do you dream?	Yeah.  Sometimes.
Did you cry when your father died?	Yeah.
Have you ever known anybody a long time?	You mean a woman?
Don't leave here.  Don't open the door, don't answer the phone.	What difference will it make?
You know what I think?	What?
Where the hell you been?	You know where I been.  I been on vacation.
Thanks.	Black?
May I ask a personal question?	Go ahead.
Well?	If she is, the machine works.
What?	What desert?
How come you were in my truck?	I was tired and didn't have any place to go.
You want to go home?	I don't have one.
Where are your folks?	They left.
We scared each other pretty good didn't we?	We sure did.
You look# better.	Just better.
And you live in this building all by yourself?	Yeah, I live here pretty much alone right now#
Twenty.	What's your problem?
Ah, you get hold of your friends?	As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.
What makes you think so?	You're all so perfect.
Hi!	Yes?
Oh, now, that's a great one!	You like it?
You're kidding!	No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
Let's go talk first, Adam.	Yes, ma'am.
How do you do?	I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?
Get out of here!	No, you get out of here.
I came on a bus.	Why doesn't that surprise me?
So far?	Yes, I'm right?
I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me!	Get away from me!!
So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do is drive you to your hotel?	Yes.
Wait!  Wait!	What is it?!
How's that?	Oh, I could die#
Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.	Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
See, ya.	Why doesn't it never work out?
You got it! Wait here while I change.	Sure.
Wait! Wait!	What?
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.	Hey, you know. I was thinking#
Thank you.	And, um #I guess# I guess you and I, uh#
There's something else I would like you to help me with.	Name it.
Well# Okay. I would like you to help me find a#wife.	A wife?
When do you need her by?	Two weeks.
Could we talk about that a little later?	Of course.
Now, get out!!	Yes, ma'am!
Where's he gone?	He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
All right.	So, what are you seeing?
Hey, Eve!	Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
No!  Not crazy!	Do I look crazy?
I thought I was here to meet women.	Not that one!
What about her?	No way.
Okay. I like that.	Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
That's ridiculous.	Maybe. But that's how it works.
Adam?!	I'm sorry.
I don't blame you!	Eve, I'm sorry.
I'm leaving, too.	But, Eve, I would--
Eve?!	Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!
There.	Thanks.
Uh-huh. Adam?	Yes, Eve?
Hi, Eve!	Hi, Adam.  This is, uh#.
Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel.	Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
Oh, boy! A jacket!	Your mom made that all by herself.
Adam#don't forget#don't forget #	Yes, father?! Yes?
It's a very small place. People don't even know it's there.	And it's called#?
That's right?	I've never met anyone like you in my life.
This must be very new.	Yeah.
Not on him.	I'm not wearing his pants.
That's why little things mean so much to him.	I LOVE THIS!!
What?  What is it?!	The sky!!!
Hello.	Hi.
Oh. A nice one, I hope.	Yes, ma'am.
I'm afraid you've got to.	I'll be all right.
Right.	I just hope this is still good up there.
Yes?	I was thinking that, uh#you know, while I was up there and all#that maybe I could, you know#try to meet a girl.  I've, been thinking about that a little#just these last#fifteen years or so.
Mom?  Eve and I have to go.	What?
We have to go.	No, wait! At least stay for dinner!
This is your bedroom?	No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
You got a light, honey?	What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!
You hear that?!	Yes.
How long will we have to stay down here?	I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
Home sweet home!	To you maybe.
To go up.	To go up.
Hi, honey! Feeling better?	No.
Oh, no.	What?
No.  I think it's just right.	And I was wondering#if#if I could have a#
Watch this!	What?
Hi, honey!	Hi.
No kidding.  Who else would have done it?	And I made these!
What did you wish for, Adam?	If he tells, it won't come true!
If we still have one.	Yes#
He's smart.	Yes, dear, I know.
How long will you set it for this time?	I thought ten years.
Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.	Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
Stop it, you two!	I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
Give me your hand.	Oh, my God#
But first, you have to start with the clothes!	Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
You're serious, aren't you?	What's that supposed to mean?
Well, what do you think?	I think#it#works.
Just be yourself.	Always good advice.
What's that mean?	We did not leave together.
Where are you going?	To bed.
What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?	You're goddamn right I am!
Oh, no!	What?!
What do you want to do with it?	Give it back to him.
Adam!!	Where?!
I can't tell the boys from the girls anymore!	Uh#yeah. It's like hard.
Frank. Come in.	Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer.
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?	Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
Are you Detective Williams?	Yes.
Come into the study a minute.	Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
Jeffrey?	Yes?
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?	Okay.
Detective Williams!! Detective Williams!!	Detective Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?	Well.
What do you want from me?	I, I don't know.
Do you like that?	Yes.
Do you like talk like that?	No.
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?	Nothing. Are you alright?
Don?	No.
Thank you. honey.	It's okay. It's okay.
Do you like the way I feel?	Yes.
You can hit me, if you want to.	No, please. I won't.
Do you like me?	Yes, I like you.
Hi, can I come in?	Yeah, hurry up though.
I liked being with you last night.	Same here.
Oh shit.	Frank? Can you stand up?
Nice guy. Who's he?	Who's it, you mean.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.	There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
Look.	No.
Who is Don?	Don? Are you in with them?
Come in.	Hello.
It used to make me laugh, but.	I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.
Do you like my body?	Sure I do.
What do you want to do?	I'm doing it.
You like to open me, don't you?	Yes.
That wouldn't be too good, would it?	Frank would open you.
Do you love me?	Do you love me?
I love you Don with all my heart.	No, it's not Don.
I guess I should go.	I want you to stay with me.
I'll call you.	Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
Oh no.	No.  Hi baby.
Yeah, it's me.	Oh God, Jeffrey, is that you? Oh God.
Where have you been?  Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.	It's okay. It's okay.
They hurt his head.	Who, Dorothy?
Hold me, Don.	Don? Where is he?
Frank gone?	Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
MOMMY!	Mommy's here.
Who's this fuck?	He's a friend. From the neighborhood. We were just talking.
Look at these. What are these?	Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
No thanks.	No thanks. What does that mean?
Hey? You like to walk.	What?
What are you lookin' at?	Nothing.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?	This is it.
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.	Be right down.
I'm going out for awhile.	Do you want the car?
Can I use the car tonight?	Of course, Jeffrey.
God, you scared me.	Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.	Yeah, I know.
He comes over to study.	Yeah.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?	That sounds great!
Hi Dad.	Hey Jeff.
Good to see you, son.	It's good to see you, Dad.
What happened to him?	I don't know. He moved away.
I guess I'll see you sometime.	I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
I don't want to cause any trouble.	I'm here, aren't I?
Are you alright?	Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?	Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
So, what's next?	Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
You really want to do this, don't you?	I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
That sounds good.	Two.
Here's to. An interesting experience.	I'll drink to that.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.	Why not?
Well, how did it go? What happened?	Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
What's with Mike?	He got a little jealous.
Can I give you a kiss good night?	You better not, Jeffrey.
You were late.	I'm really sorry.
Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.	Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
Everything okay?	Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!	Okay. Great!
Okay.	What is it?
What was that all about?	Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
You want to dance?	I can't dance fast.
You want to dance?	Okay.
Oh my God. What's wrong?	Frank!!!
My father has a gun at home.	No.
Jeffrey? What's going on?	Shhh. I'll tell you.
Come on out a minute, okay?	Okay.
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.	Stop it Mike.
There's ways around that.	Go find one.
Lord's name.	Mother Mary, full of grace.
Are ya ready?	Aye.
What the fuck are you doing here? What, huh!? WHAT? WHAT? WHAT? ANSWERS! I WANT FUCKIN' ANSWERS!	Get a hold of yourself, man.
Anybody you think is evil?	Yes.
Pack your shit! We gotta get outta here! We gotta get out!	What happened?
Look again for fuck sake!	I know what the fuck he looks like!
Shit.	What?  What, that guy?
You guys?	We're here brother.
No ma! No!	BLAME#
Hold this shit for us, Doc. We'll be comin back for it when we get out.	Right.
Would someone please come over here and#	Fuck!
No fuckin' hot water man. That#	Shut it. It's Ma.
Absolutely not.	No pictures, either.
Nervous?	A bit.
Where the fuck are you going?	We'll find it. Just calm down.
That was way easier than I thought.	Aye.
Nine bodies.	Oh, you're good. What were you gonna do? Laugh the last three to death, funny man?
Where are you goin'?  Did you tell him?	Yes.
Who did you kill?	Holy shit. Who? How many?
What?	Where's my cat?
Your what?! Your fuckin' what?!	My, my#
Now, what is this going to look like to those who do not know what I just told you?	It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.
What the#?	I got it ta my head now. I got it ta my head now.
Oh my god!	I#
Oh, she's quite proud of herself.	Okay, seriously, both you listen ta me now.
Promise me boys.	We promise.
Hurry the fuck up!	This is some crazy shit, man!
Worst day of my life, man.	Well, I'm sold.
Shit!# Shit! He ain't here.	What the fuck do you mean?
But in this day and age I believe what they do is# necessary. I feel it is# correct.	You believe?
You gonna do what I say, got it?	Yes.
Don't do this my son.	Open it!
Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up.	What do you want me to say?
Why?	As part of his plan. I don't know why.
Did you see what I meant about the window?	Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
Did you see that?	Yeah, I saw it.
Holy shit. What'd I tell you?	Eight dollars.
But he didn't say anything.	Hang on a second.
Is it back in?	Yeah.
Calm down. Take a deep breath.	You're right. You're right.
Holy shit.	We got it. We got it.
I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.	Like he meant it.
What's wrong with him?	What do you think?
I'll just say it.	I'll say it.
You owe me fifty bucks.	Bob?
I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.	No. We didn't.
May I have a word with you, please?	Sure.
What the fuck is going on here?	What. What's the matter?
See, now we've got a plan.	Don't worry about it, Bob.
When'd he tell you?	This morning.
We're going over to this bar if you feel like going.	No. I'm going to swim. I'll see you later.
Why don't you come with us.	OK.
I wish I'd been there.	Would of been nice.
Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --	I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
I have an idea for that.	What?
When'd you get back?	Ah. Couple days ago.
I want you to look at this.	What is it?
Mr. Henry has an inside source. We call him Steve. That's where we get our information.	Who's Mr. Henry?
What time did he say to be here?	Right now.
What do you think?	He seems pretty good.
He doesn't want to fight.	Get out of the way.
Or I might end up with a broken nose.	Did that hurt?
I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.	I don't think you will.
He was a nice guy.	He was all right.
Uh-huh?	Take your second position.
Who did that? What the fuck is that?	It's going back down.
What are you doing?	Let's go. Come on.
Come on.	I'll see you there.
Why?	We're not sure.
Mr. Henry never gave you a test, did he?	What do you mean?
Where?	Behind Bob's house.
So how is it in there? 	What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to.
I think I may have found a way out of here.	You're kidding.
And you're wrong if you think, I'd turn my back on a friend.	Hold it.
Congratulations. You passed the test.	What do you mean?
That was a test?	Take a deep breath.
How does that feel?	It feels good.
Future Man.	Who?
Let them fight.	Let them fight.
Are you serious?	Yeah. He said that.
See you.	See you, Bob.
You'll probably have them the rest of your life.	What was that?
Where you going?	Move.
Will you guys shut up? God. It's like having two little kids in the car.	OK, Dad.
What?	Is that OK?
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.	No, I don't mind.
Let's not even talk about it.	It was stupid.
Jesus, Bob.	I didn't do anything.
Yeah.	Who's got the car keys?
Is that him?	Wait a second.
Wait. Did he see us?	We're going too slow. It looks like we're following him.
What?	Bob! Get back in position!
Well, what do you think?	I don't know, Bob. What about one of those?
If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one.	What are you talking about, Bob?
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?	Good question.
What was that all about?	I can't believe you said that.
Where'd she go?	Maybe she turned.
I think we might of scared her.	Let's just go.
Bob.	I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
What are you doing?	I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
What happened?	Shhh. Slow down, Bob. Drive natural.
How much is there?	Don't count it.
You really think he'll remember you?	No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
Bob, will you please listen?	I don't want to talk about it.
Way to go, Bob!	I told you they were there.
Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do that for?	He wouldn't move.
Bob. Are you coming?	See you in a little while.
You can go first, Bob.	My brother's in jail.
How long has he been in there?	I don't know.
What do you mean get back?	Well, obviously, we got to go back.
You've got a beautiful walk, Bob.	Let's go.
It's too bad about what happened on the road.	Yeah. It is.
It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother.	I didn't have any choice.
I'm sorry, Bob.	That's OK.
That's OK.	Look. We want you on the job.
Come on, Bob.	I know it, man. Hang on.
I couldn't hear anything.	Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.
Is he breathing?	I think so.
Do they let you --	I don't really want to talk about it, Bob.
Hold on --	Here we go.
You keeping out of trouble?	I'm trying.
Your brother was up here the other day. He said you ran away from home.	He said what?
Ground defense.	Did you hear that?
Is he good?	He's damn good.
You got to have fun with it. There's no point if you're not having any fun. Would you like me to be there tomorrow?	Yes.
What's the story?	Can't get it. It won't# 
We're closed, sir.	Where's that guy going?
Hello, my friend. You in the Army, yes?	No. I just have short hair.
You a good pool player.	Got a little lucky.
I don't know.	She is a good looking woman.
How's the weather down there?	Mr. Henry?
Well, we'll see you later, Bob.	Pleasure to meet you, John.
Leaving was a business decision. We're both rich, come enjoy it.	What do you mean?
Sorry to wake you.	I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
Sit down.	I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
Sir#	Thanks.
She say what time I should call?	The sooner the better.
Who else knows about this?	Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
Sit. Can you#  [The chair. Have the chair.]	I speak English.
Of all the people in the world, you're the only one I have anything to offer.  That's why I came here.	Okay.
It's nice.  Does this picture mean anything to you?  Hmm?	It's nothing. It's just a picture.
I would want to know.  I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself.	What?
It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere#  I had to change my plan.  You understand me?  You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that.	You killed them.
They loved you.  And I killed them.	How# how can# how can you be here and say this?
It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough.	You're a liar.
I should kill you# if it's true you should die# I should kill you now!	I can't let you do that either.
I have to go now.	Is this really happening?
So why didn't you kill me then?	She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
Try again.	Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?	I don't know.
She really did that? Told you not to kill me?  I had a woman once. But after a while, what do you talk about? I mean, for us. The work. You can't tell them who you are#	I did.
You called it in?	I'm sorry.
-- car keys?	-- my coat -- but we should --
We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good.	I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
Sleep. Sleep now.	I should be better by now.
That's crazy.	No. Not this. This is real.  And he's right there# 
#but you're not -- you're not sure#	We can't wait to be sure.
You drive.	What?
Jesus! --  -- is he back there? --	-- not yet --
I love you, too.	Tell me later.
I wanted to kill him.	But you found another choice.
I know it's a dream.	You do?
God, I miss you. I don't know what to do without you.	Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is your mission now.
How do they know that? How can they know any of that?	What is this, a game?
And you got to him before we could.	I killed him???
No# Jason# please#	I was here!
What do you want?	I want to come in.
Okay, how do you want to do it?	I want someone I know to take me in.
Oh, shit#	Careful#
We need to get in there.	I'm working on it.
-- go -- take the van! --	-- the hotel -- how far? --
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?	I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
Alright# take it down.	What?
You're sure?	What? The tapes?
Show me.	Here?
This is everything? Is there.	Is there. Is all there.
-- who? -- who else is here? --	-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.	And why is that?
What do you think? Is he coming in?	I don't know. He was sick. He wanted out. I believed him.
Let's give him half an hour.	So?
He won't come.	He will. I know he will.
Rest, William.	I rest.
You know it's a trap.	Probably. But we can't win alone. We know that. This is the only way.
Keep these. We're going too.	No. One of us is enough.
They're coming!	How many?
You'll move	I will not.
Then when?	#Tonight!
Why did you?	Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way# as when we met.
Come, it'll help you sleep.	Aye. But it won't let me dream.
We're gonna be late again.	When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
What happened?	Honey. What were you doing with that?
I don't know# I don't remember.	Something must've happened! What set him off?
There must be a way to fix this.	Fix?
You're. Acting. Like your father.	Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.
How. Did you. Know that?	You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you.
Just. Like. Jason.	Don't worry. I'm gonna get you out of here.
Okay. Then go a little forward in time. What do you see now?	I see a car.
Are you stupid or what?	What?
I deserve a lot worse.	What are you talking about? What you deserve is a better brother and father. All they do is make you feel like shit.
I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?	He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
Not since we were kids.	I've stopped a hundred times.
Where# where are my clothes?	Those are your clothes, silly.
I don't understand, where are you taking me?	You'll see.
I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.	Go on. Sit down.
Are you okay?	What do you mean?
Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?	What?
Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone.	Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?
What's happened to you?	You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
I just thought you should know.	Know what?
There's one major hole in your story.	Which is?
Is something the matter?	Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something.
Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go?	Calm down, kid. Stand still.
What time is it?	It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!	Been there, done that.
It's okay. I won't bite. You've seen pictures of me, right?	Uh-huh. Mom says I have your eyes and your --
Are you okay? You looked like you were somewhere else for a second there.	Look, Jason, I need some fast answers if I'm ever gonna fix what I've done.
Just don't drop the ball, okay?	I won't let you down, Professor Carter.
Can# can# Can I have this?	Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.
That should buy you ten minutes at least.	Gee, thanks friend.
Hey, what'd you do that for?	Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
Look what you made me do!	What's wrong with you?!
What the hell are you doing?	It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
Monsieur Rick?	Yes?
No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?	No.
Nobody ever loved me that much.	And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
Monsieur Rick, I --	-- He's just a lucky guy.
Excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to America.	Well?
Good.	What is your name?
Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?	No thanks, Carl.
Here you are.	It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
Here's to you, sir.	Er, good luck, yes.
Er, goodbye, sir.	It has been a pleasure to meet you.
Say goodnight to Sam for me.	I will.
Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did you think? Huh?	We said "no questions."
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.	No, no, no, no. We must leave.
Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.	No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
Can I tell you a story, Rick?	Has it got a wow finish?
-- All right. I tried to reason with you. I tried everything. Now I want those letters. Get them for me.	I don't have to. I've got them right here.
I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.	All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him?	No, not yet.
But why my name, Richard?	Because you're getting on that plane.
It's been a long time.	Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
Where is Rick?	I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
When will he be back?	Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
You are very kind.	Won't you join us?
This time they really mean to stop me.	Victor, I'm afraid for you.
Goodnight.	Goodnight.
Goodnight.	Goodnight.
What happened with Rick?	We'll discuss it later.
Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?	Apparently he has the letters.
Yes, Victor, I was.	I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?
Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --	-- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight, dear.
Be careful.	Of course, I'll be careful.
How do you do?	How do you do?
We'll come again.	Any time.
Good evening.	Good evening. You see, here we are again.
Everything in order?	All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
I understand.	Here it is.
For the time being.	Good day.
Good evening, gentlemen.	Good evening, Captain.
You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick.	Perhaps.
Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?	Ask Monsieur Rick.
Is that a serious offer?	I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
Yeah, you were saying?	Excuse me.
Oh, no, Rick never --	-- Thanks. I will.
I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means?	I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
Where were you last night?	That's so long ago, I don't remember.
Come on, we're going to get your coat.	Take your hands off me!
Hello?	Put that phone down!
Thank you.  Will you have a drink with me please?	No.
Rick! Rick, help me!	Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
Boss!	Yeah?
Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?	No.
What's that you're playing?	Just a little something of my own.
Where is she? Have you seen her?	No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.
Save some for tomorrow.	Catch another fish tomorrow.
Get up.	Feels so good to lie here.
Can't.  Need water.	You've had today's water.
No more water, you said.	Take it.
If they can't see you, what's the point?	Survive today, that's the point.
What are you doing?	Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.
I'm lost.  Goodbye.	No!
What's so damn funny?	You are.
It's real.	Nothing out there but ocean.
You can't make it.	Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today.
You know what happened to this?	As much as anybody.
Yeah, a long one.	I've got lots of time.
Four four.  A record.	You don't seem too happy about it.
He is a cute thing.	He's your cute thing.
You know, for when you travel.	For when I travel?
Why didn't you come over, get mad at me, tell me what a stupid bitch I was.	I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.
I'm sorry# I'm sorry#	Hey#hey#it's okay!
Right back, you said you'd be right back.	A few things came up.  Or went down.
I got married.	I thought you might have.
You okay?	Great.  Really.
What will you do?	I don't know.  I really don't know.
If you say you are.	I most definitely say I am.
Thought you were going to bring her.	So did I.
It seemed like she had such a good time last time.	It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.
Look, I help take care of the place.  You got my check, didn't you Mom?	That new roof, that's your doing.
Maybe I should take a few days off. Roger's working now, you could use some help around here#	Don't you even think about it.
How'd it go?	Great.  Terrific.  The good guys won one for a change.
You what?	It was fifteen minutes late.
To life.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.	To life.
Take your time.	What?
Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it. Live it.	Deep, real deep.
Only if you can afford it.	Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in.	Good night, Daddy.
Good night, kids. Don't catch cold-- it's gettin' cold already.	Good night, Daddy.
How many months are you?	Two.
I better go.	I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this.	You think? Maybe I was.  I love this place!
You don't miss it?	I miss things. I miss# people.  I miss reading to the boys.
Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?	It will be okay.
Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do.	Nothing.
Please don't make me say it again.	No, that's not it--I just want to be sure I understand you.
Do you think she'll be all right?	She knows how to take care of herself.
Hi#	Hi#
I'm okay--I can walk.	I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold.
I thought they might take me.	They wanted a girl.
Did you bite it?	I don't remember.
I'm sorry. They're not used to seeing a car like this.	It's okay--I don't mind.
I wonder if you might give me a ride.	Sure! Be glad to! Uh# a ride where?
It's big enough to keep you out of the war, I suppose. Ain't that right?	Right.
I thought it was my turn.	It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
I don't need this--I know all about my condition.	It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.
I am not a doctor.	You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it!
What's that?	It's just my heart.
Do you like to read?	I can't read. Nobody taught me.
You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope.	No trouble.
I'm not in trouble.	Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is.
You're not yet three months, are you?	Not yet. What do you know about it?
Who cares?	Now, now. He's a good boy.
Don't let us make you nervous or nothin'--we know you gotta job to do.	Yeah, we can wait all night for the water to come back on--you just go on and take your time.
Where do you think you're going?	You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please#
You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle of the night, girl!	I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go.
But I'm not that late. You didn't have to give away my seat.	I wasn't sure if you'd make it.
Thanks for playing along. I just have to sit for a while.	Tough day?
Oh. Well, thanks for the drink.	You're welcome. I was just going to ask you if you'd like to join us.
I can see why you liked her.	That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed the Mark.
We were back on.	After you cut her loose.
Whoa. What?	We're going to give him the money back?
Jake#	It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys.
I'm going home	Let's go, Jake?
That's it? What are you talking about? We can still do this!	Jake, I mean, come on --
What? I can feel you looking at me.	That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.
You know what we're doing with the money.	And what about Big Al?
When?	Tonight. Just me.
How much we going after?	Two million.
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.	We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
Yeah# Whatever, Jake.	No, not "whatever." You're either in or you're out.
She up for this?	She's up for it.
So that's it#	That's it.
Why?	You ask a lot of questions. Come on.  Let me see 'em.
How much?	I think two million.
Excuse me?	I said take off your fucking shirt.
Come here. Feel this.	No thanks. I'm good.
I can't be here! You understand? I can't --	Listen to me! It went to shit. It happens sometimes.
Oh Jesus!	LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me!
What -- What do we do?	Help me.
What about# The money?	What about this situation makes you think I can answer that question right now?
What is this? You guys cops or something?	We're not cops.
That's not --	You interested in a little work?
Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.	Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off.
What the hell's his problem?	Don't worry about it.
He's gone.	Uh-huh.
You told me to change my hair!	What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
Look at you# You want to go.	For what? A couple hundred bucks?
How do you deal with --	WHAT?
Jesus# Take it easy.	No, I'm not going to take it easy. You can't stay clear of this guy. He will be on this until the end of time.
What about#	What about what?
Sorry. I didn't know#	Your friend, Big Al? It should have been you.
Yeah.	You better get over to Al's. Now.
Meet me at my place later.	How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
Uh#	What?
Him.	You sure?
But if you wanna talk about bad luck#	Where the hell is she?
When this is all over, you're going to tell me who the King put on Al.	You going to have the time?
What'd he say?	Oh, you know# Don't fuck this up. I'll kill you. I'll kill your family. I'll shoot your dog# All the usual. Then he said good luck.
The King, huh? Nice going.	I try.
What?	Consider him part of your crew. Consider him a part of me.
Did he buy it?	I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
You guys awake?	We're here.
You sell it.	To who?
What are you doing?	High five.
Jack. Do you need a ride?	No. Thanks.
What kind of deal you looking to?	What's the Blue Book price?
How about fifteen hundred?	How about five hundred.
I found her in bed with someone.	Who was he?
Last hand.	Hey. I've got an idea. Why don't we#
What's the time?	I don't know.
How did it go?	Fine.
When you get home, I'm asleep. When I leave home, you're asleep.	I'll see you in my dreams.
What are you doing here?  You know the rules.	What about a drink on the way home?
I don't like it.	Why not?
The door, Jack.	Leave it.
It's beautiful. Thank you.	I hope it brings you luck.
What?	You were talking in your sleep.
How did you know I was here?	I thought you wouldn't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here.
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.	There was a message, wasn't there?
Great.	Found a job?
I've lived there.	Well, thank you anyway.
Oh hello.	You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.
How did you hurt your hand?	Just an accident. Nothing.
Which side do you like?	You choose.
I'm in trouble.	What kind of trouble?
They mean it.	Who's they?
And I thought you were only after my body.	I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
Next time it'll be my neck.	What about my neck?
I want you to forget what I said.	Wait a minute#
How much do you owe?	Let it go.
I'm sorry.	What for?
Is it yes?	Yes.
Would you like a drink?	No thank you.
I don't think we should meet again.	It's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you.
Where to?	Turn left at the lights.
Where do you live, Jack?	Over the river.
I'm going over the river. I'll give you a lift if you like.	Thanks.
So how do you feel, your first night? I'll bet you're on a high.	Nice car.
What are you, a cop?	If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
Hey Jack, join us.	No thanks.
I can't give you a lift back tonight.	Don't worry.
Rough day?	Rough life, Jack.
Haven't you forgotten something?	I don't think so.
You want me to check?	I said good call.
Girlfriend?	Yes.
I just want the job.	Jack, you're not the usual type we get here.
I can tell, the damn thing just doesn't understand.	Look, bomb#
What's he doin'?	I think he's talking to it.
The key!	Key? Key? What is the key?
It didn't go off.	Oh, God#
Hey, bomb#	And I saw that I was alone.
Hello, bomb, are you with me?	Of course.
What are you gonna name it?	What?
Okay, okay.  I can explain# You ever have to do something you really don't want to?	How I make my living, what's your point?
Fine.  So call her.  Get her over here.	Actually, that's not gonna be necessary.
See what you don't know is you're already in the last two minutes of your life.	You're in the last two seconds, you don't cut the crap.
You can hardly blame him, the way you've been taking care of business#or should I say, not taking care of it.	What're you talkin' about?
Some of us are trying to sleep.	You didn't tell me you lived with her.
Move it.	Where?
How're ya doin', Max.	You mean until you showed up?
What are you doing here?	I live here# Guess I don't have to ask what you're doing here.
Lemme put some clothes on.	No time.
Out there.	No way.
But I'm afraid of--	Don't look down.
What're you looking for?	A grand.
Oh my God!  In here!  IN HERE!	SHHH!  Don't do that!
Damn# Are you alright?	They took my daughter.
What makes you cry?	If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.
Sorry about your window.	Can we go somewhere and talk?
Lemme get my coat.	The one you're wearing?
How'd you find me?	Wasn't that hard.
What's this?	Open it.
Know where I can find her?	You don't want to.
This is not a place you wanna go.	Let go of my hand.
Say the words, "I understand."	I understand.
I asked you to keep that thing outside.	You did.
I don't know what your story is and I don't want to.	Here's your money.
I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive.	You and me both.
Gotta go.	Where?
Not right now.	Not right now?  Okay, when?
Who are you?	What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list?
Make the call.	She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
Can you put that in a bag or something?	You get it when I get her.
Don't believe everything you hear on TV.	What if he's on the level?
Catch you back at the wall.	Later.
This is a hot run.  Beat it.  You're late.	I was on call. 
You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.	I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.
What about this?	I'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I'm not feeling so hot.
No problem.	Thanks.
Sorry.	It's okay.
We've got to take this slow#	Right, slow#
Coming dad.  I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.	Bye.
What are you, high?	Yeah.
Any luck?	Plenty, but it was all bad.
Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there!	Check!
What the fuck!	The paint!
Now listen up. Here's the game plan.	#I mean, my mom's got insurance. What's the worst thing she could do? Ground me for the entire year? I can handle that#
No# You don't think#?	Nah. Couldn't be.
Cool.	I'm really sorry about that, man.
They're still at my house in Trip's jacket.	They're what?
Oh, hi, mom.	NOW!
Trip, you fuckin' asshole.	What?
I did it! I did it! We won!	We won?!
It's gone.	I can see that, bright boy. What happened to it?
Oh, yeah! You and what army?	The KISS Army!
Gimme your gun, boy!	No, you gimme your gun, boy!
Is that your final answer?	Yeah.
I did?	Yeah, you did!
I feel bad for his family.	Yeah.
How can you do that?	I can do anything I want# and so can you#
I want to show you something.	You have to do something for me first.
What happened to your eye?	I am so sorry.
Hey#	Hey#
Wanna walk me home?	Sure.
You're weird.	I'm sorry.
Where are you going?	I'm going home.
What happened to your neck?	I don't want to talk about it.  So what happened to your neck?
You know# we've been going together for a week and a half#	And what?
We're moving through time.	What?
I know she's here. She never leaves the house.	Maybe she's asleep.
What? How long was I asleep?	The whole movie. Let's go.
Hey.	Hey. You OK?
Did you call the cops?	Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.
Come with me.	Where are we going?
You're my only son#	I know, Dad.
So, I met a new friend.	Would you like to talk about this friend?
Do you believe that the world is coming to an end?	No.  That's stupid.
How many times have you seen Frank?	Four times# so far.
What is going to happen?	Frank is going to kill.
So I hear you have a girlfriend.	Yeah.
How much are they paying you to be here?	Excuse me? What's your name, son?
Thank you for seeing us# We# just felt that it was time to discuss#	What I think is going on with your son.
Has your son ever told you about Frank?	Come again?
Our son just called me a bitch.	You're not a bitch.
No. I took a year off to be with you.  Of course I care. Don't get angry.  What?	How did you know --
What is wrong with you?	I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
Go on! Get out!	Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.
I hate her!	We all do. Now let's go.
What?	You heard me. Where is it?
If you're gettin' at somethin', you better just say it.	I just did.
If you want seconds, then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.	Bitch!
Here, I didn't get any.	Here, have some.
Hi#	Hi.
Here, I'll take it. It's my job.	NO#  It's all right. I got it. Don't worry about it.
So, uh, I -- I'm not really busy Friday. I just said that -- y'know.	I know.
Oh! What is it?	"Proud# to be# an# American."
Here I am, Father.	Take a letter.
My dear President#  read it back#	"My dear President"#
Here I am, Father#	Send for my car#
Father#	Take a letter#
Who to?	None of your business#  Take another letter.
What's the matter with you?	What's the matter with you?
Hey you!!	All right -
Late again, eh?  You haven't been on time once since this war started#  Get out there and fight# 	I can't do it#
Now -- how many men you got in your army?	Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
Then it's war?	Yes.
What I called you#  Why, what did I call you?	I don't remember.
What'll I do with this card?	You can keep it -- I've got a whole pack#  Now what were you saying?
I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.	Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
Oh yes. You have so many nice things, and so much room.	Oh?
Did it go well, darling?	Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
I'm sorry# I don't know either. I just don't know.	Well, these things take time.
John loves the house.	Do you?
Yes.	And here are my mother and father.
Our man is sick. Come right away.	What is it?
What are you going to do?	I'll show you! I'll show you!
Don't!	Shut up!
What did you do to him? He's been like this all night!	What do you mean?
I like doing business with you. You and I understand each other, completely. I know I can trust you. Can't I?	Everything will be seen to.
I want my man back.	Just a moment, how did you get in here?
Now I think we really do understand one another.	Right# Right.
Don't be frightened. He won't hurt you.	Indeed!
Oh yes?	And what was that, John?
How did you, know the rest? I never taught you the rest of it.	I don't understand.
Can you imagine what his life has been like?	Yes, I think I can.
How are you feeling today?	I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
I want you to know that I don't go about giving my pictures to just anyone.	Oh, no. I would never think it! It's so beautiful. You are so# I'll give it a place of honor, here, next to my mother.
She's very pretty, your mother.	Yes.
Have you read it?	No, but I certainly shall.
I'm sorry I could only get you a third class ticket, but it's all we had.	Oh no, my friend#
Thank you very much.	Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.
Good evening. How are you feeling?	Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
This# is my new home?	Yes.
The Children. Where are your children	Oh, they're gone for the day# with friends.
Would you# would you like to see my mother?	Your mother?
Good morning, John.	Good morning.
How blind of me. Is there anything else, John, anything at all that I could get for you?	Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
#my# home?	Yes, John.
My home.	There is one more thing, John. Here.
Stand up, John. Let them see you.	Oh no, I couldn't.
Goodnight John. Sleep well.	You too, my friend. Goodnight.
Won't come out, eh?	No, he's very upset about something.
Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him?	Take him? Now wait# I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him# just having a laugh, that's all.
Open up! I know you're in there!	Ah! It's my father!
Right! Where is he?	Who, Father?
Well# where is he?	There's nobody here, Father. Look for yourself.
It's all right! It isn't happening!	But, Father, it IS!
WHAT did you say?	I said welcome.
Please! Please! What are those?	What are what?
What's the matter?	PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
WHY?	Yes.
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?	What# you mean "got into bed with" them?
That's just what I was trying to tell you. You ARE#	Five this week; how many the week before?
We mustn't let him land!	Who?
Just give me a hand.	I mean, you could have killed yourself.
No!	I'll bring it back.
Then I shall come too.	No# no#
But# How is it you can see me?  You can all see me?	What d'you mean?
How?	Well# for a start# er# there's no killing#
Would you like us to sing to you?	That's very kind of you, but we're in rather a hurry# We're#
No.	They didn't like it! Oh God! I want to die!
I'll tell you what#	Yes?
Careful!  They're not supposed to hurt you.	You've got to let me go!
Is there something the matter with it?	Oh! No! No# of course not# it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
Of course I like women# I LOVE 'em.	You don't love ME.
I've come to take you back to the land of the living.	What a stupid idea.
Have you tried to ask the God for anything?	Well# no#
Why should you care?	I don't know! I just did!
"But" what?	But#
What are you talking about?	Come on, move it!
How deep IS the ocean?	Very deep# usually#
That's terrible!	You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed?
It's not magic! It's just a trick!	Don't you FEEL it?
We're missing all the fun#	What's it all about?
I# I# KILLED her#	That's my boy!
He can have my place. I don't want to go anyway.	Well, you ARE!
Faster!	Make your mind up.
Look, the sky is blue#	The sun! That's it!
It's magic.	What "magic"?
What did he say?	Look out!
You must help us.	We don't HAVE to help anybody.
Thank you VERY much indeed.	Now stop it!
Weren't we supposed to?	Oh# I feel a little# oh#
There is another way.	Who gets killed?
You need to say a bit more than that!	Oh# er# yes#
What do you think?	But how could he know# unless#
Well, what else do we do?	How about making friends?
But HOW?	I don't know -- but I'm not afraid to try.
Hey, you two! What's going on?	I was sitting there.
I AM one, Dad!	We haven't got a spare place.
She hasn't got any.	She MUST have a knife or something#
It can't do you any HARM#	What do we have to do?
How did he do that?	Do what?
You know, my son, our lord said#	Your lord.
Are you all right?	No, I'm not.
Well! Come on!	I# I#
I can't swim! I can't swim!	Relax!
Help!	Help!
Shut up!	She knows it was our fault!
KILL! KILL!	Stop it!
He drove me mad!	Easy, Dad!
Well I'M certainly not, either.	Neither am I.
Well# I'm game.	Me too.
And if you have to kill somebody, KILL them! Don't stop to think about it.	I never do#
Who was the girl you walked off with?	No one.
How are you today?	Okay, I guess.
I just thought I'd say hi. I was in the neighborhood.	You were not.
Come over after I'm done here?	I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
What's wrong with me?	Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
How are you today?	Okay, I guess.
Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess.	You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
I'm sorry.	Why?
Really?	Well, I didn't want to assume.
I don't need nice. I don't need myself to be it and I don't need anyone else to be it at me.	Okay.
Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.	No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.	Well, I wouldn't want to be --
Take care.	Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
You like that?	Very much.
God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.	I'm fine.
Ready for another?	No, I'm okay for now.
What do you want to hear?	You pick it.
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.	Yes.
How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?	You didn't say anything about my hair.
How can you watch this crap?	Where are you going?
Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?	I want to have a baby.
What?!	I don't want to talk about this here.
More?	No. Thanks.
What if you hide me?	What do you mean?
There's this guy!	What?
Right. Something black though.	I'll buy that. Black's always good.
I dropped you off after. You said --	Come up and see me# now.
I told her today I need to end it.	Is that what you want?
Hi there.	Hi.
I wish we did. You married?	Um, no.
I do sort of live with somebody though.	Oh.
Cool.	What are you doing?
So you'll call me, right?	Yeah.
Listen, did you want to make love?	Make love?
What took you so long?	I just walked in.
Yeah?	Did you send this? Is it a joke?
It's them.	It's too late.
Gotta get home. How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is!	Oh, God. I miss her. I can't believe she's with that guy now! I'm never going to see her again. I love her so much. What a fucking monster she is!
I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later.	I didn't want to do this. But I had to or they would've called me a girl.
Okay. I wish you could come.	This is it. The night we met. My God, it's over.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about --	You have to stop this!
Yours?	You take it. I don't know.
Hi.	Hi.
Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.	In a minute.
So# you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?	It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
It's stopped.	What?
I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Crap. Crap#	Well, what should we do?
He's coming?	You better go.
Hey.	Do you swear you didn't know?
Oh.	Hi.
What's this?	Nothing.
Mary#	Yes?
I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.	I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
Thanks.  So# do we talk about this# or what?	I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.
Oh, hi.	Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see --
Does that help?	Yeah, that looks better. Thanks.
Yeah?	Just wanted to let you know.
Is everything getting worse?	Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.
Tell me about it.	About#
How does she like what in bed?	Like what?
What do you think?	Well#. er#
What are you doing?	Getting dressed. I've got to go.
I can see why they sent you along.	So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?
Is that an offer?	It is not.
Let me breathe, let me breathe#	You're okay now, it's over#
What#?	Run!
He'll live# if we ever make it back.	We'll make it.
Do you hear it? Right there.	Hear what?
What's wrong?	Nothing. It's nothing.
What's wrong?	You didn't hear it? You must have heard it!
#I don't want to die#!	You're not going to die! Not today! I want you to do exactly as I say and I'm gonna get you out of there, alright?
We've got pressure.	Clear and open on my mark. Three# two# one# mark.
I found one.	Alive?
Yes.	One of my men is down. I want to know what happened to him.
I told you# She won't let you leave#	Son of a bitch!
Your eyes#	I don't need them anymore. Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.
What are you?	You know.
There is no Devil. There is no God. There is only# NOTHING.	You're lying#!
Jesus#	What is that?
I guess we're about to find out. Keep us slow and steady.	Yes, sir.
Thank you.	Captain, we got a problem.
Where is it, where is it#	Smith? Smith! Fuck!
Everybody okay?	We're all here.
Maybe one of the original crew?	No. It was someone else.
You've got to listen#	To what? What are you saying? This ship is alive?
If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time?	I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have.
I'll do it --	No. I'll be right back.
No. I saw nothing.	I did.
You got any coffee?	It's cold.
What are you doing?	It wants me. I have to go.
I don't think She's real big on hate.	You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
Such a sad face# You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.	Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
We're going to have to work on your touch.	I like the sound of that.
He didn't.	Oh, he did.
Where is Reed?	Victor must've taken him.
What are you doing here?	I'm worried about you.
Ben, come in.	What is this? Where's Reed?
What did you wish for, honey?	I already got it. Everything I want.
I can't take this.	Ben. This is business. Just work.
What about his first born?	Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?	Five times.
How long was I out?	Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
What the --!	Ben. Are you okay?
We had a tough year.	Yeah, nine years straight.
You're hot!	So are you!
You're on fire!	Not this again --
This is wrong in so many ways.	You've been working out.
Stop it.	Okay, "mom."
What is that thing?	I think that thing is Ben.
I'm driving.	Dude. That's my sister.
I, uh, think I remember the number.	It's been changed.
Feeling better?	Yes, thanks.
Uh, Sue#? I can't.	What? What do you mean you --
What?	We need to get past them.
Sue. Your clothes. Lose them.	What#?  Oh.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?	That's what we're here to find out.
I mean, you broke up with me, right?	Are you kidding?
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --	He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
Remember our first date here#? God, I was so nervous.	You were?
When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.	Why didn't you say something?
I can# make it work.	Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?	Not at all.
Come on, Ben, come on#	Reed, we're running out of time.
Not until Ben is back inside!	It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
What's going on?	Victor, are you feeling alright?
Victor, I'm sorry I --	Just find him.
Victor, wait, slow down a second. I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --	Susan. What are you doing?
Please don't make this personal --	Oh, I think you already have.
Were those flowers really for me, Brad?	Of course.
Go ahead. Just make it quick.	Totally.
Mom says to clean up the pool.	Why can't you do it?
Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?	They're not home yet.
Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.	Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
Is everything okay at work?	Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.
You're not going to tell me, are you?	No.
Do you have any ice tea?	Sure. Come on in.
Do you want to take a quick swim?	Well#
Pick a suit.	I don't know. It's getting pretty late#
Listen. I feel pretty strange here. Because Mark really likes you, and he's my friend.	He's my friend, too.
Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike?	You first.
I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not.	Let's continue.
Hey, Mike?	What? Are you all right?
What's wrong?	I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
Oh. Hi.	I didn't see you this morning.
What's going on?	Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it.
Why don't you call me up tonight?	Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.
How do you know it's mine? We only did it once.	I know it's yours.
Take that back.	All right, I take it back.
Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?	All right. Pay attention.
Well, I've gotta be running.	Okay. See ya.
Poor guy.	Really.
No. I don't think so. Not right now.	Chicken!
Hey, slow down. This is my brother's car.	I thought he was out of town.
What the fuck is this guy doing?	This ain't no cop.
My brother is going to kill us. He's gonna kill you and then he's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill us.	Just be glad you're all right.
How's it going.	Do you think that guy's cute?
Don't you like him?	Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.
I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.	Believe it.
Was it great?	It was okay.
You have been acting very strange the last few weeks.	I don't know# I just don't feel right.
What do you think it is?	What do you think it is?
You know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys.	What?
Mr# Mr. Hand.	That's right, Jeff. Mind if I come in?
Do you want to sit there, Jeff?	I don't know. I guess so.
I think I've made my point with you tonight.	Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
You look like you could still be in high school.	I know, everyone says that.
What can I get for you tonight.	How about your phone number?
Thanks for picking me up.	No problem.
That's a nice shirt.	Thanks. Thanks a lot.
It's very warm out tonight.	It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
I think I better take you home.	What about those other guys you live with?
Is this your first time?	Yes.
Thanks for coming to get me.	Sure thing.
This is a nice car.	Yeah. It's my sister's.
Do you have Mrs. George for English?	Yeah. She is pretty good.
Are you all right?	Oh yeah.
Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?	Not at all.
Where's your brother?	I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
So# pretty nice house you've got here.	Thanks. So#  What do you want to do?
#I've got to go home.	Do you really have to go?
Really?	Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
Naked!?	Naked.
Cut their goddamn heads off. Every one of them. That's what we're doing in California.	WHAT?
Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot. I like you guys. Don't worry about me.	Wait a minute! Come back and have a beer!
He said he understood, but I could see in his eyes that he didn't. He was lying to me.	My heart!
That's good#	I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
Why?	Why what?
Holy shit! They almost had us there! That was quick thinking.	What do you expect? I'm your attorney. You owe me five bucks. I want it now.
When does this thing stop?	It won't stop. It's not ever going to stop.
Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.	You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.
Yeah# I thought we might need it#	What for?
WELL? What are your plans?	Plans?
The airport is over there!	Never missed a plane yet.
Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it.	No! I swear I'm not!
You'd pay me for that?	You're damn right. But the first time you say anything about this, to anybody -- you'll go straight to prison for the rest of your life. What's your name?
May I see your license.	Of course, officer.
Could I have that, please?	Why not? It was getting warm anyway.
You're lying! You were after the evidence. Who put you up to this -- the manager?	I don't know what you're talking about!
Oh Lord! I'd do just about anything for that!	You and a lot of other people.
Stop!	What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
YOU'RE KILLING HIM!	They'll get in! We'll all die!
You can't keep me here. This is bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is fucking BULLSHIT!	We can't risk letting them in.
Careful.	I'm telling you, I don't see a thing --
I will not die because of him!	Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!	They'll be back.
You know where it is?	Um, yeah, thirty miles east.
We'll meet in three hours?	I don't wanna go home alone# I don't wanna see what might have#
Where are you two going?	We're going to get my little girl.
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.	Where is everyone?
IS IT CLEAR?!	Yeah.
My god damn foot is gone! Who fuckin' shot me? Who fuckin' shot me!?	Her fella.
Well, it don't look pretty.	But it's got teeth.
I don't think you should#	With what just happened upstairs --
Hey! Get quiet or get out.	C'mon guys--
Oh!	"OH!?" WHAT IS "OH?" What does "oh" mean?
They're right here.	Hey!
You all sure about this?	Follow me.
I'm gonna shoot him if they don't get him first.	Just move!
Scared?	No. You?
So, what now? Did those things leave?	Why don't you go check it out?
We're better off.	Who's with me?
Come on!	He's dead.
I'm in.	Anyone else?
We're going to get help.	We gotta try.
We gotta be close.	What?
All right!  Tell us about the truck!	Uh, uh, I think if we can get everyone into it# we can get out of here.
My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in the front and we roll out of here.	What's in the back?
How are you holding up?	Well#
Doesn't your foot hurt?	I can't feel a thing, Hon.
You wanna see, baby?	Sure.
What?	What?
They were all over the place.	You smell like ass!
Bullshit.	No bullshit.
Fine, Chief.	Gimme the keys.
What?!	Move slow and move quiet.
Shit!	I'm fine! I'm fine!
SHIT.	MOVE YOUR ASS!
Yeah, maybe.	Get something on that.
Nothin' will happen to you. You get on my back, hold on tight and we truck out of here together.	Am I too heavy for you?
Okay, well# anybody else have an idea?	Is there any other way out of this place? ANYONE?
What's wrong?	Nothing, just lookin'.
Let's go.	She's not very nice, is she?
DON'T!	YOU'LL HIT US!
Let's wait it out.	They'll tear this place down within the hour.
Hold it!	Whoa!
Go! Go!	Not without you!!!
Oh my God# What is that?	That's one piece of four problems.
Oh sweetheart! What was I thinking? Mommy is never gonna let you go. Oh Jesus# Never, ever, never let you go.	Let's lock off this room.
Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready.	All right.
You know you don't have to do this.	I'm fine, I really am.
Her name is Charlie.	Oh#
We should stick together out there.	I'd love to.
Did we make it?	I think --
Well, I suppose I should just say it. It's your clothes.	My clothes?
Good, good. Give them that.	What?
Okay, but come here first.	Huh.
Hey, where's the fire, sister?	In my eyes, officer.
You learn your lines?	Sort of.
Harry!	I gotta go now.
We're all square now, Harry. Right?	All square, Doc.
Bye, baby.	See you next weekend, Dad.
It's already started, Dad# with me.	I know.
What do I do, Dad?	You really want to go?
#So what do you think?	I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.
I'm sorry, I# I don't have a desk in my room, and# 	I don't care, Dad. I love you.
I'm going back to the hotel.	Good.
Age?	Fifteen.
Aren't you ever going back?	#Not if I can help it.
Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?	You think I'd miss it?
Honest. When you were up there, you were really# there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.	I don't know# I did# feel different# Alive.
Serious, huh?	Yeah.
Take a walk, pal.	Who said I was a lady?
Oh my God, I look awful.	You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.
You know something, Harry?	I guess.
Why are you always leaving me, Harry?	Huh?
There's just one more thing.	What's that?
Anyway# if you need me#	I got your number, Mister Man.
Where to?	Oh Harry#
This is it, kid. This is our chance. When you got a chance, you better take it.	Yeah. I don't know.
I got a new car. Only it's red. Did you know Mama died?	Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.
It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?	I'm not sure.
Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you again.	Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
Yeah.	What'd you do?
Shit!	Run!
#Is that not true?	Who's writing this guy's lines?
What happened? Who're you?	Who're you?
I'm not!	Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
How's it sound?	The speech? Real good.
But they're using you!	Oh Ma, they're not using me. It's just a chance to travel, see things. Besides, it's the only way I can get to New York.
It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.	Mama, what's#
Oh Mama, I'm so# tired of that song.	Please. I want you to. It would make me so happy.
I think I need a little air.	What's wrong?
How long will you be?	Not long.
I'll have lunch ready by one.	I'll be back.
Say you promise.	I promise I'll# I promise, Mama.
Don't# talk crazy.	Mama#?
Where are you going?	I'm going out!
Oh, just leave those things for now.	No, Mama, I'll take care of it. I'll wash them in the morning.
You were with him at the end.	Yes.
Nice.	The music? Or the fire?
Come warm yourself if you like.	You speak.
Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?	There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
What can I do?	There is something I want.  A friend.
Soon?	Yes. I want this over and done with.
You will honor your promise to me!	I will not! Kill me now!
She's beautiful.	She's not for you.
Nothing. Still nothing.	It's been months. It's not like him.
Are you all right?	Fine.
Are you sure it can't hurt us?	Nothing can. Not ever.
What kind of God is He to will this?	She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone.
I've loved you all my life	All my life I've known.
Brother and sister still?	I wish to be your husband.
You make me weak.	Not as weak as I.
Our decision. Together.	Your decision. For us.
I thought I'd never see you again!	I'm all right. I'm safe,
No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today.	Why the change? What about your work?
Brother and sister no more.	Now husband and wife.
Professor?	Oh God.
Only you would think of that!	Somebody has to!
Quite a place.	Thank you, Henry.
What happened up there?	I didn't find what I was looking for.
Are you sure you'll be all right?	Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
He's dead# She's dead# all dead# Please save me# oh# poor Bill# Oh my God, oh my God# oh God#	It will be all right. I'll take care of you.
It's just this place. The storm. That's why you're all upset.	No, no, they're all dead#
So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?	Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there#
The killer is still out there.	I will protect you.
Shows how much you know. It's something about tomorrow.	Tomorrow is another day.
I think we should go wake them up. Just in case.	Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.
You draw very well.	Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
Any particular reason?	Just a feeling.  Nothing personal.
Next Friday.	Thanks, Alice.
Alice? The others show up?	Everybody except the girl who's supposed to handle the kitchen. Annie.
You think you're gonna last all summer?	I'm not sure I'll last all week.  I'll tell Steve.
Oh, my God#	You okay?
How come you're leaving?	It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
What'll you do when you leave here?	I don't know.
I didn't know I was asleep# What time is it?	Almost five.
You can only do what you can do.	And then Steve looks at you with those hurt eyes -- like you don't care about children#
It wouldn't matter except Steve should be getting back pretty soon. It wouldn't look so great if he fell over them.	Good point.
Help you clean up?	Absolutely.
I don't hear it anymore.	Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
Where?	They're off now.
What's the matter with it?	Wet. I don't know.
You said we were special.	I meant everything.
I wouldn't know.	Oh, you#
What the hell?	Where'd you get that stuff?
Give me a hand?	For sure.
I'll be okay. Holy shit#	Don't get up. Take a second#
You saved my life.	I had to.
What is it?	Is it stuck?
Roll him over!	Get behind him more.
Did anyone ever tell you you're beautiful when you're angry?	I don't believe you#
It's just a dream.	I call it my shower dream.
This is no dream. Want to escape for a while?	Lead the way!
Are you wet?	Just a little. Wait a minute, woman.
It's beautiful#	Yeah, and it also look like it hasn't seen a coat of paint in six years.
Yeah. I got it on before this --  -- all started.	That's thirty percent.
Have to drop you here, Steve.	Sure.
How many with you?	Just my son and I.
What was that?	Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
What's this guy's problem?	I have no idea.
You don't believe in suicide.	It's not suicide if you're already dead. Two#
Not a chance.	Come again?
Yes.	Good.  Your old man's all right, he just saved your life.
Who's this?	My wife.
Is this real?	Yes.
I'm telling you, don't hurt her.	As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
Then?	Then stop, 'cause that's where we're going.
Who else?	Pass.
To your family.	To yours.
Now, is your shit together?	Forever together.
Did he#?	Yep.
About two hours from now.	So all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk right out the front door.
I promise.	Scott?
I'm going for 'em!	No!
What?	Where are you taking us?
You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said?	Yes.
We have to go back for Daddy!	Daddy's dead.
I'm sorry.	Me too.
See ya.	Later.
Where's the woman?	What?
Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am?	What?
Richard!	What?
This isn't gonna work.	Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,
You okay?	Yeah, I think so. What happened?
How?	Where are you right now?
Yes, of course.  Please, have a seat, lieutenant#	Thank you, sir.
Then good night.	So I'll get a fair shot?
Aw, what is this#	Sir#
Fine by me, sir!	No problem, sir!
Shit.  Think we're had.	Smoke her.
White House boys want a private meeting.	I'll act surprised.
Yes?	Did you hear?
You know him.	Sounds familiar.
That bad?	I feel like there's men here, there's women here -- then there's men.  But hey, what'd I expect?
"In Washington#"	What?
They're more afraid of you.	Well, now I feel so much better.
Who is it?	You know, I had an apartment about this size once.
Do you, uh, know#	Sure, sure.
She part of the training?	I don't know#
Say again, sir?	You heard me.  Move on.
Simple question, lieutenant.  No reason not to answer.  What is your father's name?	"Dad."
Would you have shot if it was a man?	No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on --
Do you?	No.
Got it.	Show us where you are, Chief.
Clear.	North?
You mind?  I'm trying to eat here.	So am I.
Who the hell are all these people?	What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.
You okay?	It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.
Animal, I can't.	Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance.
Don't you think we have enough?	Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.
Think we can fit up in there?	Only one way to find out.
He's not going to do it.	Oh yes he will.
What are you talking about? The east side is always faster.	But we can get to the west side faster.
So you made it.	What?
Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea?	Sure. I'd like that.
#he's pregnant.	Are you sure?
Is this cause of me? Because of the story?	Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?
What are you doing here?	I thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs.
If the military are listening, they must immediately destroy this building before they can escape.	Oh my God! They're coming!
Are you okay?	Somehow I never thought your life was this exciting.
Who was that French guy, anyway.	Oh, just some insurance guy.
It's Nick! I know that guy. I know him!	Who is he?
Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.	That's the problem. He did.
You don't understand, I can get us information#	Listen, this is the time when the big boys have to go to work, okay Honey?
Not for a long time, now.	Well, I think you're cute.
I'm sorry about all this.	Me too.
They will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten.	That is when we will go in.
Who are they? Lieutenant, get those people away from there.	They are with me!
Are you looking for this?	Thanks.
Do I know you?	We've met before.
How did you get all of this stuff into the country?	This is America. There is nothing you can not buy.
Three eggs. I thought there would be more.	You were right.
I think we should leave now.	Good idea.
What'd they say?	I can't get through. I don't know what's wrong.
Who the hell are you?	It's okay. I know her.
NO!  WE'RE ALMOST THROUGH!	DON'T BE INSANE, STOP! FULL STOP!
Go ahead!	You go first! There's no time!
What?  What?	Nothing.
Fred's no good, Jason. You're going to have to kill it	KILL IT? Well I'm open to ideas!#
What the hell is going on?!!?	Jason, what have you gotten us into?
Oh Alex, get away from that thing#	Dear God#. How did I come to this?
Oh good, there's nothing to eat.	Why didn't you stop at the market?
I don't know.	Nobody was WATCHING?
You said "the Commander.	What?
Yes#?	Okay, that's where you want to be.
Go. They're off again.	Up.
You Okay, Alex?	I don't like this# I don't like this at all#
THAT'S why you built this ship?	It's # incredible.
Oh, they're so cute.	Of course they're cute NOW. But in a second they're going to turn MEAN and UGLY somehow and then there are going to be a million MORE of them!#
#Okay	All right. Put me back on with him.
Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay?	Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
They're gone.	Where'd they go? Back inside?
Let me try.  Computer?  Computer?#	Only answers to me.
Wait. When are you going to tell them?	Tell them? About#
Hey# Hey where are you going?	We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW.	Let me think. I need time to think.
Are they behind us?	No, I don't think so# Wait. They're not but#  Something is.  Oh my god.
You're playing your good side.	Don't be ridiculous.
What?  What did he say?	Nothing. Hold please.
Where the hell is he?  An hour and a half late.  An hour and a half!	This is great!  They're going to start eating each other out there.
You're kidding. When for?	Tomorrow morning, before the store opening.
You gotta admit, they do love him.	Almost as much as he loves himself.
That's it, It's go time.	Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it.
I heard it too.	Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?
Wait. What did you say?	Please, don't hurt them, it's not their fault. I'm not the Commander, I don't know anything.
Commander?# Where are you# going?	Home.
Faster Tommy. Get us out of here!	It's as far as it goes!
Could be this.	Push It. Hold it down.
Do your best, Tommy#	Oh god#
Oh, right, sorry.	Okay, let's go.
Sorry Guys# It just went off.	Good work, Tommy.  Let's go!
NO NO NO.	We've got to get out of here.  C'mon, hurry
The army needs you.	The army can survive without me.
Well, George, who were you?	I?  You all know my history.
How old are you, Captain?	I'll be twenty next year, sir.
Colonel Reed#	George!  So good to be back!
Not today.	I want you to see our hospital.
We can't take them.  Are you all right?	We're leaving them?
Well, this must be about something!	It is; we need you George.
He knew it was a set up. He was ready for it.	So where's the money?
You get the money?	No. What's this?
Trade for what?	The money. Fuck. I gotta think#
And that's for the airport.	Hey, he should have a weapon, a knife or something.
What, did you see it work in some movie you got beat up in?	I have to ask you for that key.
Look, there's no fuckin' way I'm gonna give you the key, outside of you point a gun at my head. Then we might have something to talk about. Now step away from the car.	I don't need a gun. Where is it? If it isn't on you, it's around here someplace.
What's this movie you're doing first?	Harry, let me answer that.
But first I want to know who I'm talking to. Am I talking to you, or am I talking to him?	You can talk to me.
I really think I can be of service on this one.	Yeah, well, we need a ride somewhere, we'll let you know.
I need the money.	What money?
She's great. Gimme the money.	First you and me gotta get a couple things straight.
You broke in my house and I have a witness to it.	What?
I don't know.	It's not the kind of thing you do.
I can hear you, but where the fuck are you, man?	What I been wondering is where's he been.
What?	Look at me, Ray.
Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do.	Where you been, Harry?
Did you stop to think what if I had a heart attack?	You look okay to me, Harry. Come over here and sit down. Tell me what you been up to.
I'm looking at you.	I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
You're not looking at me, Harry.	Why do I have to keep looking at you?
Without him. The guy's so out of it he doesn't even know it's gone.	That's right. As a matter of fact#
That's it? That's your movie?	I said I had an idea, that's all.
You pack a gun?	Not really.
No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk# but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.	They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
What?	I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought# I told you to keep your mouth shut.
How's anyone gonna see anything from way up there?	Hey, Harry.
Here's your keys, Harry.	Get the fuck outta my chair.
Really.	Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
Forget about Leo's money, Harry.	You have it?
Yeah, he told me.	Personally?
So you don't know what I'm thinking.	No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
How about this?	That's not bad.
Lemme talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.	Buddy?
You've been losing.	I'm up twelve grand today.
But you won't know where I am. I don't even know where I'll be.	I'll find you, Leo#
The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?	That's right. Three percent.
You been here the whole time?	I just caught the end.
That why you came over here, to ask me that?	I want to know.
Yeah?	Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
Harry# My God#	What happened?
Were you scared up there?	You bet.
I'll be right back.	Go get your stuff.
You sure it was Ray Bones took the coat?	That's what the guy said.
I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.	You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
Well, aren't you gonna offer me whatever it is you taste like?	Come on in.
What's wrong?	Be quiet and listen.
What I'm saying, Harry, is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house.	Oh, yeah, sure.
How about now?	Sixty pounds.
One more?	Why not.
What is your first name?	What?
Roger.	Roger?
You think that's funny	No.
Ready?	Bring it on, dude.
Guess I'll just keep working.	What're you crazy?
Maybe that is his boat.	Gimme a break.
Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. We gonna let this guy just take it from us? One guy?	So we kill him?
One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.	Maybe he isn't alone.
Other than the obvious, there's nothing wrong with him that I can see, not on the outside.	Then what the hell happened to him?
Did you?	Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
Went aboard.	She take a radio?
It's a hell of a lot of money.	What, you think there's something funny about it?
Or somebody stopped them.	Either way, they must've had a pretty good reason.
Bodies're too fresh.	Fresh ain't the first word that comes to mind.
That'd be my guess.	So whoever did this might still be around.
Can't you use something else?	I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!	I don't know what you're talking about?
The radio!	The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.
Yeah.	You better get down here right now! We're taking water! Big time!
You're late.	Sorry.
Then why didn't they take it.	Probably didn't have time.
Coffee.	You're a pal.
Stay away. Or else.	Because of the gold.
You okay?	Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
Coffee?	Yeah. Thanks.
Why not call for help?	For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.
Take it easy, you'll live longer.	Did you see him?
How's he doing?	Same. Any luck?
The ah# the radio's out.	What?
It's not gonna hold us.	Doesn't matter.
Hey.	Hey.
What do you think happened on this boat?	I guess that's the sixty four thousand dollar question, isn't it?
She said the ship was evil. That we had to leave right away. That if we didn't, we might never leave.	What's that supposed to mean?
Why you? How come the rest of us haven't seen these people?	Just lucky I guess.
What do we do with him?	Leave him till we can get some help.  From now on, nobody comes down here.
What happened?	We hit land.
I been watching it for close to an hour and it hasn't moved. I can't raise it on the radio either. Makes me think it might be in trouble.	Alright. I'll be right up.
It's funny.	How's that?
All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.	So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.
Morning.	You're up late.
What now?	We could call for help.
I don't know.	Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
Pretty low all around.	We'll have to take it easy then. I don't think we'll find much aboard the ship, but it's probably worth looking around.
How're you feeling?	Lost my sea legs.
What happened?	You don't remember?
What about the gold?	Leave it.
What seems to be the trouble, ladies?	Whyn't you mind your own business, chief.
Will you get off my back for once?	It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here!	But I can't --
Why do you even need a ride? You could walk there in two minutes.	It's just an excuse for us to spend time with you.
Jesus, look at this guy.	Oh my God, that's HIM!
Hi# what's up?	Can I come in?
Are you the one who left that note?	I guess.
Do you want something to drink?	Why?
What?# Oh suck my fucking dick!	What?
This is so bad, it's almost good.	This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again#
So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?	Soon# I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
Much later.	In fact, never.
Hi, Al!	Can we call you "Weird Al"?
So what should we do?	Wait# I just want to see what's on this tape.
You call.	Why do I always have to do it?
Look, maybe that's him!	It's still twenty-five minutes early.
I want to "make love" to him.	I'm going to tell him you said that.
It's obviously him!	I can't believe it!
Do you think he knows?	I dunno#
Are you sure?	Totally! Look!
He's insane!	We should follow him home.
We still have to go in there sometime.	It's always closed#
There he is#	As always.
Why are we going here? I hate this place.	It'll only take a second.
I totally, totally hate you.	Aw c'mon, this is a fun party.
I'll be right back, I'm gonna go get a beer.	Wait#
Give me all your money, bitch!	Where did you get that?
That guy is totally amazing.	He does that every single day.
You're just jealous.	Yeah, right# Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!
Now are you going to get a regular job?	Don't worry.
Look, we have to get these#	I can't afford stuff like this right now.
Hello?	Do you still want to do something tonight?
Hello?	I need to talk to you.
I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me# I really do want to move in with you.	I don't know# I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
There.	That's all you're bringing?
Wow# finally.	It just came yesterday#
We're not.	Really? Both of you?# Why not?
May I ask what you're doing?	Shhh!
Don't mind me, I'll just be in my room.	Where did you get those pants?
Didn't they tell you?	Tell me what?
Go die, asshole!	Get a job!
Hi# what's your name?	Norman.
Thanks for the tape - I'll have to pay you later, I'm broke.	Hey, where are you going?
That's five hundred dollars.	What?
Do you have any old Indian records?	Indian records?
There's some good stuff in here# do you like old music?	Sure, I guess.
Yes, that would certainly do#	Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
Wow, this is so cool#	If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not?
I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them?	Who knows?
Wow!  What was that all about?	It's just somebody's idea of a joke#
Uh# hello?	Hi, it's me#
I'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date# There's something I have to show you#	I# I don't know. I don't really think I should#
What are you doing here?	I had to see you.
You need a bigger place - this is like a little kid's room.	I could never move - I've got too much stuff.
I agree.	I wish I could see him.
Did you remember to pay the phone bill?	Yeah.
I have to admit, things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit.	So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?
Thank you, doctor.	Don't thank me. You're doing all the work.
I am a man of peace.	Am I to take it you want to live?
Starting now, we attack them.	How; we don't know where they are?
You're certain about tomorrow?  But you don't seem excited. 	You don't enjoy killing, do you? 
I don't suppose I could watch.	Might be exciting for you.
What a good week.	You mean nobody died?
I didn't have a chance to thank you.	What did I do?
It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you.	You think they'll come then?  Why?
You like him, don't you?	Oh yes. But it takes time.
He has children?	Once# 
Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?	I don't believe you had a mother. 
Every day I ask you, and every day you've got something else to do.  Do I have bad breath or something?	I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me?	Certainly.
No, you didn't, Frank.	Okay, that's no problem.
So this is what you do, huh?	Oh, hello, Peter.
I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.	As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.
Is this the spot?	A little to the left.  Right there!  That's where it stopped.
Sorry!	Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.
Can I help you?	Yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.
That's quite a story.	Yeah, I think the Times might be interested, don't you?  The Post might have a lot of fun with it, too.
You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?	Okay.
Should we go?	I don't think we should leave her alone.
Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television.	How are you?  What's that you're working on, Johnny?
I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting you.	My pleasure.
You've got to do something!	Who are they?
These boys aren't playing around.	You've got to stop them.  Please!
That's it?  That's all you have to say?	Did I forget something?
Six feet -- seven -- eight --	That's it.  It's on the bottom.
Don't shoot!  You'll hit Ray!	Do it!  Just do it!
Great.  So what are you guys working on?	Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
I'm Ray --	I'm Peter --
Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it.  Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish up and get out of here.	I'll get one more reading.
My Fault!	She's new in town.
I think she looks pretty good here, don't you?	Yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.
Ready?	I'm ready.
Now that's one ugly dude.	Huh?  What?
Are you telling me how to drive?	No, I just thought --
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?	Wonder what?
Aren't you glad we waited?	I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
Now where are you going?	To the bathroom, where do you think?
Is it a star?	It is a star!  That's great.  You're very good.
Okay.  Just give me a second here.  I have to leave now but if you've got some time I'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me.	Eight o'clock?
# and then I opened the door again but it was gone.  There was nothing there.	So what do you think it was?
Why would anyone make up a thing like that?	Some people like the attention.  Some people are just crazy.
Is that your professional opinion?	It's in the stars.
That's too bad.	What?
Uh-huh.	Well, let's check it out.
Damn!	Are you all right?
Do you want this body?	Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
Nothing!  We just got rid of that thing in your kitchen.	Really!  Is it gone?
Did you see it?  What was it?	We'll get back to you.
I want you to have this. 	What is it?
All right.  What is it?	A square?
Nervous?	Yes.  I don't like this.
Something was definitely here.	Yeah, I can smell it.
Wait!  Wait!  There's something I forgot to tell you.	What?
All right.  I'll try.	I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
Ray!  Where are you?  Are you all right?	God, it's ugly!
It's working!	Easy # Easy # I'm going to throw in my trap now.
I told you it's real.	What do we do now?
How was your date?	It wasn't a date.  It was an investigation.
Ray -- Something's here.	Where are you, Pete?
It's here, Ray.  It's looking at me.	Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
You don't have to worry about that with us, sir.	Right.  We'll believe anything.
What's he talking about?  Choose what?	What do you mean "choose?"  We don't understand.
More wine, sister?  Surely you can drink more than that.	I was suddenly thinking about going to bed.
You on your way to trial, too, general?  Or do you think they've already had our trial?	Why you?
It's my brother's neck you want, not mine.	Yours will do!
Don't stop to visit -- take the children straight home and I'll follow as soon as I can.	Tomorrow?
You need to come home!	I can see that#
General, do you realize what happened out there today?	I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
Hello.	Hello.
You're living at home now. Is that right?	Yes.
Do you always drive like this?	Yes.
Do you want some dinner?	I'd love some.
Aren't you eating?	No.
Could you do it?	No.
Will you take me home now?	I'm sorry I took you in there.
I want to go home.	But could I just tell you this one thing?
Listen -- could you stop crying, please?	No, I couldn't.
Would you like to come in? I could make some coffee.	No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
Where we going?	I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
What is the matter?	Nothing. I'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. I mean let's go see. Let's go see if they do or not.
Do you?	Yes.
I'm sorry. That is not my business.	It just happened. It was just this thing that happened along with everything else. Can you understand that?
Was she married or something?	Yes.
All right.	During the day? We'll go for a drive or something.
Why aren't you ready?	Because I want to know what's happening.
What is it?	That woman --
Elaine --	Oh my God --
No -- don't cry --	GET OUT!
I'm meeting someone.	Ah. Where?
Is that him over there?	No.
I want to ask you a question.	Come in.
I said I think it is.	All right then! Yes!
Why?	Because it isn't true.
Don't tell me --	-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
What are you going to do now?	I don't know.
Are you going home?	No.
I don't want you to leave tomorrow.	I don't understand.
You won't?	I don't know.
Elaine -- are you serious about this?	I'll think about it.
I just don't think it would work.	Why wouldn't it?
Why wouldn't it?	I just don't think it would#
Are we getting married tomorrow?	No.
Ben -- I just want to say one word to you -- just one word --	Yes, sir.
What's that?	I said -- not exactly -- no.
I'm putting it here by the door.	Will you bring it in to me?
Can I help you, sir!	What? Oh -- no -- I'm just --
Yes sir?	A room. I'd like a room, please.
Is anything wrong, sir?	What? No. Nothing.
Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?	It's down the hall.
Is it a girl?	Is what a girl?
You don't?	No. 
Thank you.	Right.
Will you come in, please?	What?
All right then.	What do you drink?
Drink?	No.
Are you always this much afraid of being alone?	Yes.
What do you think of me?	What do you mean?
Oh my God.	Pardon?
I think I'll go to bed.	Oh. Well, goodnight.
Thank you.	Right.
I really don't want to put this on again. Won't you bring it up?	Where is it?
Don't be nervous.	Get away from that door.
Yes, I do.	I've got to go.
May I sit down?	Of course.
How are you?	Very well. Thank you.
May I have a drink?	A drink? Of course.
Did you get us a room?	What?
I got a single room.	That's fine.
Thank you.	You're welcome.
Now -- do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?	If you want.
How do you get out of the house?	I walk out.
What do you say to him?	He's asleep.
Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him.	No.
Why did you do that?	See if you can guess.
But I thought you -- I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.	Kind of.
What kind of car was it?	What?
Don't talk about Elaine.	Don't talk about Elaine?
I wish you'd tell me.	There's nothing to tell.
What are you doing?	Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
Hello. Get me the police, please.	Where is Elaine?
I say I've got it.	Sir?
Can I talk to you a minute?	Sure.
I drive around.	What else?
Well why do you -- why do you think that?	Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me.	Goodnight.
They don't know?	No -- they don't.
When did you two talk this over?	We haven't.
I'm just --	-- worried?
Wait a minute. You talked to Elaine this morning?	No. She doesn't know about it.
Thank you very much, sir.	Ben -- how old are you now?
Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?	Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
Can you see me now?	Yes, I can.
I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here.	I'd like to discuss this.
Is anything wrong?	No! No -- we're just on our way downstairs!
What's happening?	Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
Turn 'em up.	Oh yes -- that's right -- look! I win, don't I -- 
I want to speak --	Not now.
No --	Why?
I've quit.	You can't.
Never?	You're a fool!
He must be very nice.	Who?
We'll dance.	All right. We'll dance.
I'd given you up.	Sorry.
You were very different yesterday.	Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday.
That was lovely.	Will you do me a big favor?
Going?	Yes --
So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come# What now?	I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
Why do you look at me like that?	I did not know you were so beautiful# and --
I'm not going# You know that I'm not going# Do you think I could leave you alone here? After that --?	What?
There.	Oh -- 
Do you understand?	Yes -- yes -- yes.
You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room.	I'll go. -- I love you.  I'll be on that train. I'll get the money.
I'm worried about you.	Don't.
Thank you, sir.	Not at all, sir. 
Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least#	Yes, quite.
Is that too much, Baron?	No -- not at all.
That was my last.	You've lost everything?
I take five hundred.	All of that at once, Baron?
Oh, let the poor devil alone.	I did not ask your advice.
Hello! Hello! --	Don't do that. 
Any letters?	No, Doctor.
Any letters?	No, doctor.
Oh, but Doctor. Isn't this wonderful. To live -- to live -- in the Grand Hotel.	The Grand Hotel.
Excuse me, gentlemen.	I'll take the bank -- All right, gentlemen.
Oh, I've got to find it.	Stay where you are.
Her master's voice!  I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.	Oh, don't go.
Dance then? 	She's beautiful -- isn't she?
You must look at my face and not at the floor.	Yes.
What's the matter?	Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- Lying there, his eyes so open.
Am I!	Is the bill ready -- the lady's too?
How do you know there is a Grand Hotel?	Oh, there must be one in Paris# They have everything in Paris.
You#	Me.
Can you pay some attention to me?	Oh, yes.
Come here. 	Here, hold up!
I know you did -- I said you did --	And I said we didn't.
Shall I tell them again?	Why waste time -- it's getting late.
I can't dance tonight --	It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
He will be on the train.	But when did he go? How do you know?
Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron.	He tried to rob me -- he is dead --
If you will wait one moment, sir.	I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.
We will wait.	You are late. Hurry.
One question. Do you want to stick to that story, or do you want to keep your teeth?	I want to keep my teeth.
Want a look?	Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?	Can't move.
Yes, yes, but that's --	My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed.
It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all?	Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars.
All right.	I'll get you a check.
What? Me?	That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?
Not as tough as you, huh?	No. And you have to be.
Lucky? You call that lucky?	He let me live. He let me be his friend.
I just give you your life. What you do with it is up to you.	That's right.
What's that?	Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
I thought# I was hoping we could play it straight with one another.	I guess not. You'll be heading east from here, huh?
Going somewhere?	Somewhere else, that's for sure.
You want a drink?	I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
Well, uh#	Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.
You heard the shower, didn't you?	I don't care about that. This time, I gotta have the rent.
Where's the five?	In your other hand.
Well, well. In a real hurry, are we?	Always, for you, baby.
Her job.	I want to know everything about you.
Get well soon.	Every day in every way.
I don't see why we have to take the train.	Because it's comfortable.
What if we want to drive somewhere while we're there?	We'll rent a car.
No.	See you soon.
Think about it. Okay?	Sure.
Yeah?	Open your door.
Don't I get any say in this?	No! Because I --
What is it? What's going on?	I'm happy the way I am.
I realize this is a shock.	Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
Oh, Jesus.	No question, huh?
That's that, then.	Oh, yeah. That's that.
That's it?	Care to join me?
I'll be damned.	Do I know you?
Mind if we sit down?	I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.
Jimmy, what are you doing?	Checking out your place.
Where are you going?	To the bathroom.  Can I do that alone or do you want to watch?
Shit, John!  What the hell were you doing out there?!	Nothing.
I'm sorry, alright?  It was just a stupid joke.	Will, sit down#
Where are you going?	I don't know.
He found you, didn't he?	Get on the bus.
Not me.	Why not?
Nah, I didn't tell her where I went.	Is that all you guys can think about?  Amy never came back last night.  Maybe she's in trouble.
What are you doing here?!	I came to see you.
You look kind of cold.	I'm okay.
Better?	Yeah.
Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?	Looks great.  It does.
It's John, isn't it?	It's always John.
Hey, you alright?	What?
There's something I have to tell you both.  It's going to sound strange#	What?
Wait.	What is it?
Fuckin' A.	He gave me a fuckin' A?  Wow.
Let the party begin.	Have enough fun for the both of us.
Guess they -- went to the fair after all.	Guess so #
What if your parents come home?	Then they can watch.
Aren't you gonna answer that?	Answer what?
No, Mom -- keep it on!	Okay # But just for tonight.
Mom, I want to go to the fair #	You can't expect us to stay here --
Come on, Mom.  We're gonna miss all the fun stuff!	Danny, you're just going to have to wait!
Mommy, I'm scared.	There's nothing to be scared of, baby. It's just another storm.  Try to get some sleep.
Mommy!!!	Danny!!!
She wasn't here when I brought Danny home from --	Danny, go downstairs -- Now!
My, God!  What have you done to him?	I didn't -- He got in a fight and I --
Do you know how insane this is?  Who am I supposed to be looking for?	Him.
God, what's wrong with him?	Here.  Let me try.
Where's the baby?!	He's gone.
What now?!	Wait a minute #
Come on!	It's not working!
What is that?	It's a sign.  He's come home.
There you are.  Who was that boy?	An old friend.
You've created a monster.	Amazing, isn't it?  I even taught him to drive.
No!!!	Stay away, Sam.
What do you know about Michael?	I know he's alive.  People in this town -- they want us to believe he's dead.  But I know. I've always known.
Who else knew I had the baby?!	No one.
Run, Tommy!!!  Run!!!	No!!!
Miss me, baby?	I dunno, boy.
Home.	You know what gets me?
You know what gets me?	Oh, shit.
You know what gets me?	Go home!
And how were things?	Let's talk about something else.
Otherwise, how are things?	I sure didn't expect her to drop dead.
What's funny about that?	You know me, boy.
So, kid--how they hanging?  Or don't you say that to a little kid?	He's a man.  Tell him you're a man.
Insurance!	You actually sold insurance!
What an awful sound!	Get used to it.  Back door, Paul.
Fifty years?	You're making a joke.
If I were married to him, I sure wouldn't walk out.	Never mind the condition of your body and your spirit!  Look after your things, your things!
Anybody home?	As a matter of fact--
You were about to ask a question?	Are you--do you--
Yes, wife, it is.  Come here, boy.  Your father is home.	Sir?
Dad?	Who was it?
Mom?	What's this?
What's this?	Nothing.
Then speak, by God!  Can you fight with words?	I don't want to fight you.
Can I help you, sir?	I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
What's the matter?	Give us time.
What's that all about?	We thought a doctor might help.
You know what I want?  I want you both to be friends.  I know you both, respect you both. You should be friends.	Nothing would please me more.
I'm so glad you like each other.  I was so scared, so scared.	Have some.
Awful.  I can't tell you how sorry I am.	Say hello to your mother.
He hasn't had breakfast yet.	Buy yourself breakfast.  There we go.
Now--turn around, if you would.	Turn around?
Well--what have we here?  A family.	Almost a Christmas scene.
I'm going to call the police.	Don't!
This is suicide.  Go get the police.	Stop!
Help your mother find the bullet.	There it is.  Give it to me.
How do I load?	Load it for her.
Give me that Goddamn thing!  Now get out of here, or I might kill you.  Who knows?	You've killed women?
Hello?  Oh--hello, Mother.	Hello, Mother.
Look--I'm sorry--I have to go.	We'll miss you so.
Yes!  Yes!  The boy!  One boy!	And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
Safe and sound, I see.  Oh--you came back.	I came back.
No.  No.	Get up.
Alice got married again.	She did?
Dead!	Jesus.
And you, Colonel?  Let me guess: You don't know.	I dunno.
So long, you guys.	What will you do, Colonel?
That goes double for me.	I don't want to live any more.
Don't touch me.	Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
I hate that thing.	It's beautiful.
Where will you be?	Anywhere but here.  I'd just sit here and cry about the way my father's been forgotten.
Mom?	That man is your father.
Really?	It is an emergency, isn't it?
It came yesterday.  I haven't opened it yet.	Maybe it's supposed to end now. Maybe God wouldn't have it any other way.
I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?	He isn't any friend of Father.
Please--	He's not anybody to tell somebody else what to do in a master bedroom.
Coming.	Women are always late.  You'll find out.
Gentlemen!  Is this right for a fight?  It's been so long.	Beautiful!  I've never seen that coat.
What then?	We could have had some kind of birthday party for him.  We could have taken Paul to the fight with us.
Did you see him?	Yeah.
Possibly.	How long has this been going on?
I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.	Tonight's the night.
This is very good for us.	It is?
You know each other?	We met here earlier this evening.
I'm taking her to the airport a few minutes from now.  She's going to East St. Louis--to visit an aunt.	Tell her to have a nice trip.
Get out of here.	It's really that bad?
Do it!	Goodbye.
You've got to fight from time to time.	Not true.
Kid--kid--	It's good.  Let him go.
We have this new club up here in Heaven.	Yes, we do.
You're not exactly the type we're looking for.	You mean I'm black?
You're still dressed?	Well, I want to#
Now, what do you want?	I said I just wanted to talk to you#
I'm getting angry.	Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
Hello. You want some information?	Yeah.
Are you the star of this picture?	You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
Are you a private detective?	Something like that. How much do you make?
I thought you were going to bed?	I am.
No.	Huh?
You have anything to drink? You want to go out and get something?	I don't drink, but you can go out.
You're not a private detective either, are you?	No.
Look, I really don't know your daughter but#	But what?
Why do you say that?	Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
Where is she?	I don't know.
I'm only human, you know.	Get out.
Where'd you hear that name?	I just heard. Who is he?
You want to go for coffee after we send the girls off?	No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.
How's your business, Jake?	Pretty good.
Jake?	How did you find me?
Just do what I say. Don't ask.	What is going on?
Hey, stop, stop. I'll do anything you want. It's okay. I can dig it. You can do anything you want to me.	Where is she? Where is the girl?
I hear you got money to spend.  I hear you're interested in# interesting things.	Yeah.
You wait here. I'll find out where she is.	You ain't goin' nowhere alone.
This is from the movie I was talking about.	I don't know what you're talking about.
I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything.	Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
Hold it, mister.	What do you think of that? Or this?
What does that do?	Well, each time he comes in closer, like this.
You can fuck off, too.	You're taking a big chance.
Okay, lady. Out.	Hello.
Haven't we met before?	None of that, lady.
Eh, no. Thank you.	You're welcome.  Did you know him?
Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?	No, thank you. I have my car.
Do you dance?	What?
What do you think?	Oh. Eh, I like it.
Why do you say that?	Because they are all the same.
What happened?	Look.
Oh, my. We're too late.	Is he all right?
We'll come back in the morning.	What is that he's working on?
Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together.	But I don't play anything.
I think I see it.	Yes. It's almost there.
Look at that sky.  It's so big.	It's so blue.
But they'll put me in jail.	Really. Just put it there, Harold.
Look at the stars.	Yes. They're old friends.
It looks like you. Thanks.	Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old.
I suppose you think this is very funny, Harold.	What?
Love? Love? What do you know about her? Where does she come from? Where did you meet her?	At a funeral.
I'm going to marry the woman I love.	Harold!
This is insane.	Perhaps it is.
Oh, is this your father?	No. My uncle.
I don't think I'm getting through to Mother like I used to.	Does that worry you?
Harold?	Huh?
I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all?	No.  I'd have liked to.
Good idea of yours to come out here, Harold. It's a lovely spot.	Thank you, Uncle.
Stay where you are, Harold .	She took my head.
It's different for us.	We've always been here.
Oh, right. Daddy's died and gone to heaven, eh?	Yes!
See? He's here. You should learn to believe your Uncle Frank.	No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!
It's a beautiful dress#	I know.
She's done it.	She certainly has.
The box. I need the box.	The box? Like in your story? Like in his house?
Get out of the way.	Are you crazy?
I have to go back. Or it'll never stop.	What are you talking#
I'm scared.	No. Don't let it. You've come this far.
But I didn't open it! I didn't!	Then why are you here?
But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours.	And what about you?
I# remember.	You were ALL human!
I need to touch it to "see"#	See what??
It's almost over!!	No. It's not.
It's got a big stone -- in its hand --	I think that is its hand.
Don't look! Turn around.	Is it bad?
I'm in way over my head, I know that much.	You're doing fine.
Well, you did break out --	I wanted to see her.  It's nobody's business.
Hey, hey, hey. They're playing our song.	We're on the move.
We should go back -- you -- you could tear that door apart --	Don't move. We --
Thank you.	My job.
Oh. Uh. Hello. I -- I have these. For you.	Father's back?  Still angry?
What took you so long?	C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
Down there. Did you ever loose track of him?	Well, let's see -- there was that moment, when I had a train on top of my head --
Anything else you --	Not from you.
Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there.	Alone?
Goodnight, then.	Goodnight.
It's nothing. Just a list -- It's not finished --	Oh, okay then. Maybe later then.
But I understand what you don't like about me. I do. What I am makes you feel out of place -- out there --	Red, I --
He -- loves you.	I know.
But it's not true, is it?	What -- ?
Hit me.	What?
Hello, I'm --	-- Late. Five minutes late.
Wait! Wait! Watch the fucking paint work.	Look, do you want the bed in or not?
Christ!	What's the problem?
It's my lucky day.	Hi.
What's happening?	We're leaving.
Will you sign for the bed?	Sure.
Alright, let's give it another try.	Do you really need this bed, lady?
That your daughter?	Uh-huh.
We want the man who did this --	No. That wasn't the deal.
Just in time.	Stay the fuck away from me.
Please. Get back into bed.	I have to speak to my father.
Please listen to me --	First things first. You can have a telephone when we've talked. Do you know who did this to you?
Don't touch me. Or so help me --	What? What will you do? What CAN you do?  There's nothing to be frightened of.
I bet you make your Daddy proud, don't you? Beautiful.	This isn't happening.
No.	One last time. Give me the box.
Come to Daddy.	This isn't happening.
You bastard --	Poor baby.
There is going to BE a wedding?	Oh.  Oh yes.
Well?	I don't want to see the dress.
What about Larry --	Forget him.
Help me.	Tell me who you are.
No. God no.	Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't.	What do you want me to do.
Well?	Better. Very much better. I'd like something to wear. And some cigarettes. Will you bring me some?
You can't love him.	I don't.
She'll tell them everything#	I don't think so. She'll want Larry first.
You look terrible. Have you had an accident?	I was here this afternoon.
No, damn you --	Oh my God.
Maybe somebody changed the lock.	Like who?
How long since you were here?	The best part of ten years.
Larry!	I hear you.
Where are you?	In here.
Well?	Why not?
How are you doing through there?	It looks like a bomb's dropped.
What have you done?	I cut myself.
Is it deep?	I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood.
Look, I'm going to have to leave you guys to keep each other company.	Larry#.
Are you all right?	Just feeling a bit sick.
Are you all right?	Fine.
-- I'll go see.	No. I'll do it.
Larry#	What's wrong with you?
Oh baby.	Don't go upstairs.
Huh?	Please#
What's wrong?	I don't know where to begin#
Not much fun, is it?	What?
You know it's not often I# you know#	There's a first time for everything.
Well, isn't it?	I# suppose so, yes.
Is this your place ?	Do you care ?
This isn't the bedroom.	No.
What's going on?	We don't need a bed, do we?
I suppose not.	I prefer the floor.
First time for everything.	That's right.
Why don't you take off your jacket? You're warm.	Yeah, why don't I?
Why don't you do the same?	Maybe I will.
You know, you're very beautiful.	Am I?
Oh Christ.	What's wrong?
You're awake. Good girl.	What happened to me?
Who brought me in here?	I won't be a moment.
You wouldn't believe me.	Try me.
Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name?	Steve.
Who's there?	Daddy?
I thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?	No Dad.
Well I want you to see the house.	I'm not going to change my mind, Dad.
Great.	Well come over, will you? See the place?
Big house.	You like?
What are you drinking, love?	I've forgotten.
#maybe we should never have come back.	Maybe you should give it some time.
She doesn't even want to leave the house.	Really?
Would you# maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends.	Sure.
I have to talk to you.	Of course.
Poor Frank. He's better off dead.	I don't believe it.
Get the fuck out of here.	What's the problem?
Where are you going?	I have to get out.
I won't be able to stand.	So lie down.
You're not going?	Just upstairs.
I'm here.	I thought we'd lost you.
You know I do know the way home.	It's late.
I beg your pardon?	There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
Oh no?	Oh no.
Oh!	Are you alright ?
Are you busy after work ?	Just trying to get my apartment in order.
Steve. Thank God you came.	What happened to you?
These THINGS# they want to take me --	What things?
What's wrong?	Don't let them take me, Steve --
I'll come back later, huh?	Sure. Why not?
Do I know you?	I don't know.
What are you doing?	I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
Yeah.	But now I kind of like it.
What?	What do you mean, "what?"
Hey.	What the fuck is that?
What the fuck is that?	What?
I'm looking for a record for my daughter.  For her birthday.  "I Just Called To Say I Love You." Do you have it?	Oh yeah.  We got it.
Great.  Can I have it then?	No, you can't.
What?	Nothing.
He's got one!	On Clark Street!
I can't go to the club tonight, guys.	Why?
Who are you going to see?	Nobody.
Don't do it, Rob!	He's not worth it!
Rob, hi, so sorry I missed your call. In LA on business.  You know how it gets.	Yeah, sure#
Hey Charlie.	Hey Rob.
Hey.  Didn't you steal that one already?	Can I help you?
Let's not.	I want a tape.
Rob --!	-- FUCK OFF!
Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone.	You look upset.
So shall we leave it at that then?	I dunno.
You don't have to go this second. You can stay until whenever.	We've done the hard part now.  I might as well, you know#
Shit!	Hi.
So.  Where have you been staying for the last week?	I think you know that.
I'm sorry.  I haven't been very fair to you.  That's why I came here to the store this evening.  I feel terrible, Rob.  This is really hard, you know.	Good.  So.  Is it my job?
I guess it's not that obvious, then.	No.
What?	What, what?
Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.	So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
And anyway, I keep trying to tell you, that's not really the point, is it?  The point is we got ourselves into an awful mess, Rob#  Are you there?  What are you thinking?	Nothing.
Hello.	It's me.
Are you still in love with me?	Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later.
I called and called but you were out.  I thought I'd be gone before you got back.	Is that the last of it?
I'm sure.	You still together?  Going all right?
Hello.	Hey, how ya doin'?
I'm sorry.	No, no.  When are you going home?
Me?	My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and# oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like#  He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
Look, are you coming or not?	Yes, of course.
When are you going back?	I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.	Hi.
You know, with Ray#	Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
Let's go home.  Okay?	Okay.
C'mon.  I want to know.	Want to know what, exactly?
Look, Rob.  If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. And that is my last word on the subject, okay?	Okay.
All I'm saying is, you have to allow for things to happen to people, most of all to yourself.  Otherwise, what's the use?	No use.
Hi.	Hi.  What are you doing?
I'm sorry I've been acting like a jerk.  I do appreciate what you've done for me, and I know you've done it for the best possible reasons, and I do love you, even though I act like I don't.	That's okay.  You seem pissed off all the time, though.
Are you worried about tomorrow night?	Not really.
Are you going to talk to me, or shall I get my paper out?	I'm going to talk to you.
What are you going to talk to me about?	I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not.  To me.
I'm an idiot.  I should have played the record first.  This place is about to get burned down.	It's gonna be fine.  These people are ready for anything.
Don't you like that?	No, no, I love, it's just, thinking you're, you must be so sick of it# Well.
Are you okay?	Yes.  You?
I'd like it if you could stay the night.	Oh, right.  Alright.
Would you like me to turn the lights out?  Or would you like them on?	God, you ask a lot of questions.
Which way are you going?	That way.  You?
Yeah?	Hi, Rob.  It's your mother.
Hi, Mom.	Everything all right?
She left.  She's gone.	What do you mean?  Where did she go?
These are worth at least, I don't know --	I know what they're worth.  Give me fifty and get them out.
With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want.	I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
I think you have more.	Well we don't.
How's your uncle?  I hardly ever see him anymore.	Fine.
Would you like more tea?	No thank you, I'm fine.
Do you play?	Yes.
Jesus Christ.	You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.
He tried to kill me last night.	Where?
Who is he?	At the moment?  Carl Smith.
No.	No one knows you're here?
You did kill those men.	Not all of them.
No.  So what now?  We just wait?	Yes.
Here, try this.  I suppose they're still making women the same as back then.	It's beautiful.
I don't know any of these.  I'll make a fool of myself.	Follow me.
Who are you?	That would be difficult to explain.
What's wrong?	I can't stand it.  Oh God, I can't stand it!
Get out.	No!
Forget it.	I'm just curious.
I'm calling an attorney.	You and I should talk first.
I don't believe him.	Why?
I did at that.	And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?
It is as you are.	No!
Three days you've laid there. It's time you ate.	This can't be.
I'm your future husband, remember?	I have no future husband.
Oh please.  Another one.	What would you like?
That's wonderful.  Where did you ever learn it?	Far away.
We must talk.	Stay out of it.
Do not turn your back on me.	You are really going to force this, aren't you?
You see Major?  You are not so different#	I had no choice.
I want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff.	Figure she's with him?
Where!	I don't know.
Smith.  Carl Smith.	How many came?
And have you something to settle with me?	Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
He found us even there.	He always did.
Long time.	Not so long.
What's the point?	This isn't done.  Get up.
This your present address?	Yes.
Look, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I think I've got a pretty good idea.	Do you?
You're one of William's kids, huh?	His only kid.
Morning Mr. North	Same.
I won't be more than ten minutes, I promise you.	Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.
Oh, it isn't like that.	It will be perfectly all right, Walter. Mother is coming with us on the train.
You know, Hildy, he's not a bad fellow.	You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
Too hot?	No. It's strong.  But I like it that way.
All right, dear.	Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?
No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.	But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
Hildy!	Hello, Bruce#
BRUCE!! How'd you get out?	Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
Oh, she was here.	Where'd she go?
Hildy! Where's mother?	Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
Here it is, Bruce. One -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars.	Thank you.
I'm taking the nine o'clock train, Hildy. And you can meet us at the station.	Fine.
Mother? But your mother --	No. My mother.
Well, I'll try to give her one.	I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
How long would the interview take?	Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.
Well, she'll know some day.	That's all I ask. Oh, wait a minute.
Don't want to forget this, you know. Might start to rain again.	Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away to get that story.
Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting a good man.	Thanks a lot.
Well, I got to get back. You can find your way out, can't you?	Oh, sure.  Well, thanks for everything.
No -- I was just talking to one of the guys at the office. 	Oh.  I wonder what's keeping mother? She was supposed to come down and get you.
I know how you feel, Bruce, but you've got to forgive her. She's only a woman, after all.	Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.
Oh, Bruce, let me see that money Hildy gave you.	The money? Why?
Oh, this is all right, Bruce. I just wanted to be sure.	Say, I want to be sure, too!
What's this?	Get out of here, you!
How long is what?	You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
Then what does he want with you?	Now you got me.
And he takes his hat off when he's with a lady.	What for?
Allow me.	Thanks.
Well, I'll tell you one thing, old man, she never looked at me the way she's looking at you.	I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
Where do you think you're going?	Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
Hildy!	Huh!
For Pete's sake, Hildy, they're waiting for the rest of that story!	Okay, Walter. 
Hildy!	All right, Walter.
Well, keep going! We want an extra out on the streets before it's too late!	Where's Bruce?
Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?	Hildy, you think I could? After this story?  Here! You're just nervous.
Don't tell me -- was she killed?	Was she? Did you notice?
Ring that number, will you?	Come here. See if we can move it.
No, you don't! Walter!	What is it? Here!
No!	Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I dare him to move that desk out of here.
Wait a minute!  Let go there!	Murder, uh?
Well -- what is it?	What's the difference? I'm going to write that story -- and you know it!
Hildy!	Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
How about Bruce's?	Walter, you can't do that!
But, Hildy -- I can explain --	You -- you!!
Anything you want, Boss.	Beat it out and get hold of some guys.
You know me. The shirt off my back.	You got plenty of money?
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?	I think it is.
How much?	Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
Let's see the money.	First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that gun?
Open up there, will you!	All right -- all right!
She looks as though she's going to come to.	Give me a hand with her, will you?
Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't around.	Who's this guy she's gonna marry?
Hold the phone!	I'll have it in a minute.
You ain't gettin' out o' here!	Now, where is he?
We know what you're up to.	Probably goin' out to get Williams.
No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town tonight.	You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.
Just a minute, Johnson!	Let go o' me. What's the idea?
Johnson, I'm going to the bottom of this. What do you know about Williams? Are you going to talk or aren't you?	What do I know about Williams?
Where'd you get this?	I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
That's murder!	All right! Carl! Frank! One of you get on each side of the desk. Take hold of the cover.
Read it! Insane, he says.  He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!	Yeah. But I --
Pete, I want to talk to you!	I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
Pete, you're through!	What do you mean -- through?
No -- don't out me off.	How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. That's almost a hundred dollars a week!
We'll fix that, too. 	Just -- one -- second!
All right. Tell 'em to shoot to kill.	What?
Who is this man?	Throw him out, Frank.
That's a lie!!	I never saw him before!
Got you, Williams!	Go on -- shoot me!
Where's the old lady?	I'm telling you!
Any news?	Yeah. I was never so tired in my life.
Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone.	I thought so, too.
Did you get that, Hildy?	No -- what?
Okay.  Forget it. 	What's the matter with you boys? Afraid it might rain? If you want to go, I'll cover this end.
Look out, you --	What's the use of fighting, Hildy?
Hiding him where?	Mother!
Mother!	That man there!
You're not going to phone anybody where I am.	Put down that gun, Earl.
Earl, you don't want to hurt your friends, do you?	Don't move!
Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.	What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
Earl, you must never do that again.	Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
What good'll it do?	We'll get you out in ten minutes.
I'm coming!  Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.	I'll be right here. I won't leave you.
What's the idea?	Never mind! Just play dead.
Hey --	Shut up, you!
Who? Me?	Who do you think!
Why not?	I couldn't work in the city. You see, I've got my family in the country.
They wouldn't take it.	You're insane!
There she is!	Say, Hildy#
What's your hurry?	We want to see you.
I never was.	Yes, you was. Make him talk.
I know a secret.	What's that?
Well go on then. You can't join if you can't answer.	I only know one.
Go and ask her if she wants to play.	Ask her yourself.
I did see them. I did.	He's the worst liar.
Can't we just see the end?	They've got the real thing outside.
It was great for me, how was it for you.	A bit too quick.
We all had to write a last letter home.	And it was the last. Hasn't written a letter since. Not even a birthday card.
Has Sue got it right?	What's that?
Taste it. Why don't you taste it?	You taste it.
When do you think you'll get leave again?	Not till Christmas, I don't suppose.
I'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.	I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me.	The ideas you get in your head.
And where do you think you're going?	Out.
I want him. I want him so much. I'll kill myself if I can't have him.	There, there, my baby.
What did he say?	He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
I don't believe this is happening to me.	It's not. It's happening to me.
Is it peace in out time?	No, Mother! It's War! War!
Please yourself.  Let them go, if they want.	Grace!
It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.	Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
I didn't mean it like that, Grace. Why does it always come out wrong?	I know you mean well.
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.	Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
Come on, ma# this bitch's got it coming.	No, I told you#
Who's your Daddy!	Who's your Daddy!
What about the tree?	Oh yeah, the tree.
OK, whatever. Let's go get your brother's truck. Faster we get the truck, faster we get out of here.	OK.
Don't worry, I'll be right back.	Come on.
How much further?	Almost there# are you in a hurry or something?
The door's locked. I'll gotta go around# wait here.	OK.
Christ, you scared the shit out of me.	Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
Thank you.	You're welcome.
Hey, um#  #what kind of animal is that?	A dead one.
I'd like to see that.	Nice.
Can I help you with something?	I was just wondering.
Keep the change and get yourself a new name.	Holy crap, thanks!
Keep straight on this road here.	How much further?
Come on, we need something like this. It could be the real deal. It's too far out of the way to come back to.	What's that?
I can't believe what I'm seeing.	I know, this is fucking nuts.
Almost there.	Jesus, you think she was really gonna cut you?
I like sleep.	Here he comes.
Fuck! We are fucked!	Turn that fucking radio off!
Don't look back, just get in the car.	Lock the fucking doors.
Should we stop?	We can't leave her out here in the rain# maybe we can just drop her at the next rest area.
Go around him.	There's not enough room.
Well, I got some bad news and some bad news.	What?
Fine. I'll go straight.	What!
Forget it. I'll just go.	Screw that, no way, I ain't letting you go by yourself.
I hope to Christ she doesn't expect us to wear these things.	Whatever it is just do it. The more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here.
How much is a person supposed to stand?	Quiet.
How long is that gonna take?	He should be back in a couple hours.
Huh?	Grab Mary and come inside.
Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us.	When?
Thank you.	Yes, thank you. Thank you very much.
That was good babe, just keep doing that.	That's not me. I didn't# I'm not doing that.
Come on sleeping beauty, time to go to work.	Sleeping.
I think I'm going fucking crazy.	I can't believe#
How long has it been?	I don't know# about half an hour.
What was that?	What? I didn't hear anything.
Jesus Christ.	I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack.
Excuse me, may I please use your phone?	Bill, why don't you ask her# she's your special friend.
What'd ya got there?	Keys.
I'm gonna go ask him.	Aw, come on Jerry. We've gotten all we're gonna get out of this place and its starting to rain.
Just back up.	I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right?
I'll go. It's my fault.	You said it, not me.
God damn it, I must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch.	Huh?
I suggest you kids leave now.	Don't worry, I'm gone.
Where is he?	Let's go see.
Think# do any of these kids look familiar in any way?	No, I can't say that I ever seen 'em before#  #he looks familiar, is he on TV?
Don't worry, we'll find her.	Let's hit the road, sooner we get a move on sooner we'll find her.
Over.	We found one.
What is wrong, my darling?	Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world.
My little French.	Stop. Get away.
Call you back.  You bastard! What do you want?	I just want to talk.
Like what?	Well, I think it would be easier if I could talk to you in person.
Well?	God, you're beautiful.
Yes, please, somebody ask him what is wrong.	I don't know.
I'm going alone. This could be dangerous.	Okay, my sweet. Good night.
Very well.	Very well.
You what?	I want to be the way I was before.
Done!	Ready!
I'll be in touch.	No you won't. But it's okay. You have stuff you gotta do.
Boy, this is good!	I'm sorry that I became so upset.
What are you doing in there?	I'll be out in a minute.
Do you? Oh do you, darling?	Why certainly!
Did you see that?	What?
What are you doing in there?	Nothing. Be right out.
I think he's ready.	Oh boy!
Wait!	Yes?
Hey, another one for me and another one for the lady.	Check!
Give me a bottle of beer.	Right.
Huh?	It's open#  What'll you have?
I'm ready.	Soon as I finish my coffee.
I want to talk to you.	Do we need words?
I'll make it up to you.	How?
Are you ready for another?	Thank you.
In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it?	It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money.
Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?	That's the way it's done.
We'll be there.	Good, good.
How much?	Oh, about five hundred.
That seems a shame. The night is young.	The night is two thousand dollars old.
Okay?	Sit down.
Make it twenty.	Cut.
Maybe by that time you'll die of old age. How much do you think you'll, uh, need?	A thousand.
Hello, Eddie.	Hi. How's business?
You know, that's real sweet music in there. You can almost smell the action and the money. You know, I can feel it right down in the bottom of my shoes.	Come on, let's go#
Aren't you gonna go over and talk to him?	Nah. Sit tight. He'll be over here.
So does Eddie.	Well, I win sometimes.
What's the matter? What happened?	It's all right. She had a little too much to drink, that's all. Forget it.  Go upstairs and sleep it off.
How do we stand?	'Bout even.
I can beat him.	All right. Five hundred.
I'll beat him the next game.	How're the hands?
Please don't get off me now.	I know when to quit. You don't. Win or lose, you don't know when to quit.
I wanna walk.	It's a long walk.
Set 'em up again# C'mon, set 'em up again.	You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet ya any more.
Ten grand. I'm gonna win ten grand in one night.  #Well, who's gonna beat me? C'mon, Charlie, who's gonna beat me?	Okay# Okay. Nobody can beat you.
How do you feel?	Fast and loose, man.
Quit. He's too good.	Charlie, I'm gonna take him.
How much we got?	Eleven thousand four hundred, cash. Here in my pocket.
What are you trying to do, Eddie? You beat him. You beat him bad. You wanna kill yourself?	What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
Is this all we got left?	If that's all you got, that's all we got left.
Hello, Charlie#  C'mon in#  That's my girl.	Hello, Eddie's girl#  I looked all over for you.
Oh, I don't want to be no bother to nobody.	Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
With what?	Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.
Just like that?	Yeah. Just like that.
No, no more for me.	Well, hello. Haven't seen you in a long time.
You gentlemen care for a drink?	No, none for me. Come on, let's play.
Hi.	Hi.
Long wait for a bus?	Yes.
How long you been waiting?	What?
Just a cup of black coffee, please#  Hey, ma'am! Wait a minute!  Would you, uh, like another cup?	Fine, thanks.
What time does the bus leave?	What bus?
That wouldn't give us much time, would it?	Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't.
Have a nice trip.	Thanks. I will.
Have a nice trip?	Fair.
Why did you do that?	I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
What time is it?	Eleven o'clock# I'll be back later.
I got my things over at the hotel. I'll bring them over later#  Come here.	I'm not sure# I don't know.
You were asleep when I left. I didn't want to wake you. Did you go out?	Yeah, I went out for a couple of hours.
You know, I've been living here for almost three years. Now in three days it seems as if I know everybody. When I pass people on the street I want to stop and say, "Listen, I got a fella."	Thanks.
Well, I believe you when you say you go to school.	You want to go with me?
Oh, cut my finger.	I've got something in my bag.
Eddie, what's in that case?	Haven't you opened it?
Do you want me to go?	No, stick around.  Can I get you something? Drink? Coffee?
You going out?	Yeah. For a little while.
What are you writing?	Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.
Give it to me.	What's this supposed to mean?
Who is it?	Me. It's Eddie.
You can read it, if you want to.  You want to go out for a while? To a movie?	You wanna drink?
You glad?	Yes, I'm glad.
Well, what's so funny?	Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.
What is it, Eddie?	Nothin'.  Want another drink?
No, I want to walk.	Come here. Come on, now.
Don't you want to know where I'm going?	No.  Yes, I want to know what for. But I don't want to ask.
If you don't mind I think I'll stay at the hotel.	Well, what's the matter?
Go on back to the hotel.	Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
Your shot.	You miss?  Well, you don't leave much when you miss, do you, fat man?
#you shoot a great game of pool.	So do you, Fast Eddie.
You -- think I am -- I'm --  -- an animal.	No.
Are you all right?	Yes.
Do you remember where you lived?	It was warm.  I was outside.  The ocean?
Who is this?	My wife.
Was this -- "beautiful?"  Before?	Yes.
Do you remember where it is?	What?
You want to find them.	Yes.
Why don't you start with me?	You're not them.
What do you want?	What do you mean?
Mine.	Have you always had it?
You want me to stay?	Yes.
Do you still want me to stay?	Yes.
You have to go.  He'll never stop. Leave this place.  Find another.	I'll go.  We'll both go.  Far away.
I remember the first time we met. Do you remember that?	Yes.
You and that damned garden.	Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?
Need some gas?	Please.
Hell of a night.	You got that right.
Bathroom?	Round back.
Son # are you awake?	Yes.
We're going to be moving, son.	Do we have to?
What's that, Dad?	That's the Air Force Base.
Well, son?  Should we call it a night?  I for one have had a long day.	Okay.
Are you sure you saw that?  In the rain -- it may have looked like it changed shape --	I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
Are you all right, Dad?	Sure # fine.
I had an awful dream.	What, Jim, what?
I know, Ellen.  We'll settle down soon.	I was so scared.
I'm home now.	Yes -- but #
Better get some sleep, son, or you'll be pretty tired at school tomorrow.	Good night.
What did he talk to you about?	He was upset with moving, I believe.
This is a new town for you.  Do you like it here?	No.
That's quite a story.  You know that, don't you?	Yes.
I swear it was here.	But it's not, Jimmy.
Stay here.  I'm going to make a phone call.	Who are you calling?
Did you call the State Police?	All their lines were busy.
No one comes here after dark.	Hide the car.
Damn.	I know a way.
What is it?	I don't know.  I don't know what I'm doing here --
Well, come on, you two.  Time to go to bed.	Mom -- this is the best show all year.
What do you think he saw?  Could it have been something from the air base?	No, Mom.  It wasn't a plane.
Your father asked you a question.	What? -- I# 
Hi.  Sorry I'm late.	The back door was open.
Mom.  I gotta talk to you.	What?
When?	This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
What do you want?	You have to leave the White House.
What do you want me to do?	I want you to leave with us. Right now.
Just my luck, no ice.	I take it you've heard.
You still believe in him.	He's a good man.
Are you all right?	Did it work?
We're losing them.	Then get them out of there.
What the hell is this?	So sue me.
There's good news and bad news.	What's the bad news?
Tell her to get the kids and leave town.	What happened?
Perfect, she's using it.	It's perfect the line is busy?
David, David! What the hell are you doing!?	I'm making a mess.
What the hell are you doing?	Just getting a feel for her.
Nice meeting you.	You as well.
We're loose!	Doesn't matter. Game's over.
How're we doing?	Better than we thought.
Wait. I have to tell you something.	What?
You know, you're not as charming as you think you are.	Yes, I am.
You're late.	You know me#
Before we do this, I want you to know I'm sorry.	Sorry for what?
And when the dancing's over? What about your future?	Funny, it used to scare me when I thought about the future.  Guess it doesn't really matter anymore.
I shouldn't have left her.	Don't worry, big guy. I'm sure she got out of here before it happened.
Damn it!	I didn't even see them fire!
But I gave you some this morning.	I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore.
They let you out?	Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
We're leaving, don't try and stop us.	You're not going anywhere. You hear me? I'm still your father.
What the hell's going on?	We're leaving.
Mr. President, a real pleasure. They don't let us out much, you know.	Yes.
Why did you people come here?	Air# water# your "sun."
Yes.	Papers, sir. Got it here.
May we go home now, please?	The dog!?  You are named after the dog#
You know how long I've been looking for that?!	All your life.
Your treat.	Yes. My treat.
What has the old fool got himself into now?	I don't know. But whatever it is, he's in over his head!
What about you?	I'm going after Dad.
Look what you did!	It's war.
The Word of God#	No, Henry. Try not to talk.
I'm through!	We're through!
Doctor Jones?	Yes?
I said go around!	You said go between them!
My room!	Mine, too.
What are you going to do?	Don't know. Think of something.
This one. I think he's in here.	How do you know?
How did you get here?	Where is it? I want it.
Dad!	Out!
It is you Junior!	Don't call me that, please.
No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.	Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
Found it.	He was actually there? You saw him?
#you did it.	No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
You didn't, did you?  You didn't bring it, did you?	Well, uh#
No! Don't Shoot!	Don't worry. He won't.
Dad!	What?
Come on, Dad. Come on!	What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
Stop!	What?
I didn't know you could fly a plane.	Fly# yes. Land# no.
Dad -- eleven o'clock!!	What happens at eleven o'clock?
Dad, are we hit?!	More or less.  Son, I'm sorry. They got us.
Those people are trying to kill us!	I know, Dad!
What do you think you're doing?! Get down!	Dad, we're well out of range.
Dad?!	Junior#
Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!	I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad.
What did you find, Junior?	Junior?! Dad#
Ready?	Ready.
Uh-huh.	After you, Junior.
I knew you'd come, but my strength has left me.	Who are you?
This is your last chance.	No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!
All right! Where's my father	If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
I believe we're being called to dinner.	Finally!
You never told me you spoke my language, Dr. Jones.	I don't like to show off.
He was afraid of you. He knows a tough guy when he sees one.	Yeah, that's what happened#
Come one, what's wrong?	Behind you!
That's far enough!	You are in no position to give orders, Dr. Jones.
What're we going to do?! Where're we going?!	The airport# No, look out, Short Round! Left, left!
What'd he say?	He told me they knew I was coming here.
And then they took their children.	Their children?
What's happening?	It's starting to let go!
I'd like to find one of those myself.	Oh really?
Couldn't keep away, huh?	Just try and control yourself.
We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.	Don't catch cold.
Let's go! Let's get out of here!	Quiet!
Wait -- what're you doing?	I'm going down.
What?	You've got to go to sleep now.
I was scared to death last night when I thought they were going to kill you.	No# they won't kill me.
What're we going to do?!	There's got to be another way out.
I can't!	Go!
Anymore ideas#?	Yeah -- this time you're gonna help!
I get it!	You got it!
Give me your hat#	What for?
I said something.	I know you did!
No, not her. Me.	Who's you?
My name is AL.	Al ???!!!
Where are you,#Al?	You're not gonna believe this#
Al.	Yes?
You're in my head#	Yes.
Somebody's been here.	Where are we now?
Who are you?	Who am I?
Look! I didn't ask to be in you. Don't blame me for it. You did it.	Me? What'd I do?
I know#it sounds insane.	You said it.
You're not crazy. Don't#wait a minute, just let me explain.	You're gonna explain.
You'll be alive.	With a man in my head#
What was that?	Who was that? Somebody out there?
No they won't.	Why not?
What'd he look like?	He's not the problem. It's the van in the back.
Now what?	Whatever you do, just#don't stop.
I want out.	Too late#They want you.
Did you hear that?	Yeah.  Al wants to talk to you!
It can't take that long.	Why?
JOE Or what?	I don't know. I don't want to find out.
Ever think of what they might have to do to find me?	Find You?
They'll have to take you apart. #piece by piece.	Why don't you just get out, leave me alone.
Sue them.	I'll sue.
I don't like the sound of that.	We have to get out of here.
Now what.	Go out, take your first left.
Which way do I go?	What does it say.
Like the guys that attacked us.	What do you mean?
I'm back.	I'm at the airport.
What do we do?	Send a man there. A secret agent.
You mean#just leave.	We get on a plane.
What about money?	What about it?
Now what?	The beach.
Holy shit!	What is it?
Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head.	Little late for that.
Now lie down somewhere quiet and rest, I'll be back in a while.	Where are you going? Wait!
Al, are you doing anything in there?	What? What do you mean?
Beautiful!	What was?
This must be business, there's nothing else here.	Follow it.
She's#pretty fast.	You're out of shape.
What is it?	She's beautiful#! What do I do?
Help me out, will you?	What can I do? You're on your own.
What do I do?	Don't just stand there, say something.
.	.
Wait.	Wait.
Where is she staying?	Where are you staying?
Touch her.	What?
#Joe.	No#you idiot!
Now, where would I be?	What are you looking at?
But what's it look like?	What's nothing look like? #it looks like nothing.
You really like that shirt?	This#is not going to work out.
Much too blue.	Not blue enough.
Mind your own business.	It is my business. It's my name.
Not that tie with that coat.	Why not?!
Which one is she?	The beautiful one.
They both look good to me.	You have no taste.
Get close to them.	That place. By the window.
You're not just after this girl, are you?	Who, me?
I feel like an idiot.	Just hold them close and stay still.
Just don't show fear.	I don't know what's going on.
Joe, be careful!	#I've lost something. I must get it back.
They're all in it.	How do you know?
What Happened?	I don't know!
And on my time.	It's not your time. I get time off.
You been had. We have.	It wasn't like that.
Some agent you are.	Why don't you get out of my face.
What do I do?	Follow her.
Come on, she's getting away.	I can't keep up.
Don't touch a thing.	Don't worry!
#drink it.	Too late.
What next!	Drink lots of water.
I can't#	You have to! Quickly!
Door to the right. Get up and run.	I can't see a thing.
What?	Never mind, just say it.
It's him.	Come on.
You sure this will work?	Not sure at all.
Do it.	I can't handle that thing.
Are you alright?	Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on.
Holy#	#Shit! It's just money.
There's a lot you don't know.	And don't let her know, either.
This may hurt.	Well, don't let it. What are you doing?
Do something.	What exactly?
Be quiet.	Where've you been?
She is beautiful.	You've changed your mind.
I know it's no good.  I've no right to be jealous.	She's in love with you. Anyone can see that.
You're a lucky man.	Yeah, sure.
She's so lovely. It's all my fault#I was wrong.	You're lovely.
I don't know how we're gonna get out of this, but we will, somehow.	I want you to know how much I appreciate what you've done.
In a way, we're like brothers# I can't have her. I want you to.	That's nice.
I've got twenty hours left. I could die in here. And you're falling in love.	JOE It's not love. It's like. It's real strong like. And I got your information. Now, get off my back!
Not that truth!	Aren't we all.
Sorry#	It'll remind me of you.
Doesn't matter.	What part what?
I've seen that before. Never had anyone actually do it.	Do what? What'd you do?
What is your name?	Don't give her your name.
No!	Oh, I can't.
Can you fly this?	Don't worry.
I'm#scared.	Look, I don't know how we're gonna get out of this.
Nice?	In my own way#I want you to know that#I love you.
I knew you were trouble.	Trouble#is, if we both get stuck here.
You didn't tell us you were coming?	Then how did you know?
What Job?	Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
Who is your friend?	We met on the beach.
What are you doing here, where've you been?	I have a new client.
Well, I'm glad to see you. Sorry things broke up like that.	It's just money.
What brings you here?	I came for a rest. As, I imagine, you did. To get away with it all.
Joe.	What?
Al?	The little man in my#  #head#
I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.	Of course you're not. We'll take good care of you.
And you, there are many places to get away. Why here?	A little voice in my head.
Don't do it!	Just give me the keys.
Now you know what I know.	Sir?
Yes#What is it?	What's what?
Oh#and who is it!?	I didn't say anything.
What do you do about what?	#I'm looking for someone.
Is someone else here?	No. No one to speak of.
I'll be right there.	Where?
And you.	#right here too.
I can't do that?	Do what?
What's so funny?	Nothing#Al. Why do you talk   that way?
You mean from it.	Yes, of course.
You again.	Me still. They left you alone?
Promise you what?	That you're not crazy.
Joe! What happened to you?	Why'd you run off?
Why did you leave?	They left. I had to go with them.
Why did you stay with me?	Wanted to get to know you.
You're leaving.	Food doesn't agree with me.
You know where he went?	What's he done?
I don't know. He mentioned a city.	What is it?
You don't believe me.	Oh sure.
Now what?	We figure out if it's in here.
What?	I said just relax. I'm in full control.
So do I.	This going to work?
Why not?	Can you?
What happened?	I can't fly it.
Are you alright?	Yes. No. I'm#okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
What a mess.	You can say that again. What do we do?
What?	They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.
I'm sorry I got you into this.	It was my choice.
Don't blame yourself, I didn't have to come along.	Why did you, then?
How?	What?
Now what?	I've never met anyone like you.
Uh#wonderful. I know I'm strange, but in my own way, I love you	I love you too.
Don't worry.	Why not, what are you going to do?
Just like that?	I'll come back for you.
Kiss her you fool.	Her?
Who are you? Who do you work for?	Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
He can't help us.	Do something!
It was me. He just told me how#I wish he could tell me now.	If he was able, what would he say.
Come on.	That's twenty feet high.
What is it?	We're not moving fast enough for him.
What could you find in this place?	#Piece of mind.
Excuse me?	Could have been drunk a little sooner, but excellent#good character#What is it?
I can't. He didn't do anything. Thanks to you.	Why are you on to him?
Is there anything else?	A drink#
Wait.	Why?
It's alright.	It is?
Mom#what are you doing here?	Leaving, now go to sleep. #all of you.
Right there.	Thank you.
This the only spare?	Yes.
What'd he say, how's he know about Al?	What does he know?
Look, nobody knows we did it.	Whoever took it does.
Hi, honey.	Hi, Daddy.
Hey, baby. What's wrong?	What's that outside, Daddy?
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?	You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.

Yeah, I'm here.	What chance is there of getting Jeff's interview on the air#?
#I'd be lying to you if I did not tell you how important it was in the court of public opinion#	#and I'd be lying to you if I didn't tell you, I'm about out of moves, Dick#
Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"#	Hardly new news.
Okay, let's look through the looking glass the other way#	What do you mean?

You believe that?	No.
What's changed?	You mean# since this morning?
I don't know how to say this, Jeff, except to just say it right out, so I'll say it. They do not want to air it.	What?!
Did he hear you?	You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
What about now?	What?
What's happening?!	He doesn't seem to be listening#
Jeffrey, how are you? How's the family, okay?	There is -- there is no family.
And, so, I moved out# I see the girls a couple of days a week#	Where you staying now?
No!	I had no idea until after, but --
I'm happy for you, pal.	Thanks, buddy.
My God.	What?
Who was that?	That was -- oh, shit. What if he's on his way over there?
Well. He said to "make the house mine."	Oh boy. If he only knew.
-- we are both sure that's what we want?	Absolutely.
Hello?	Miles?
Is that you?	Me. Yes.
And here I thought my mother was#	Your mother was.
Friends?	Don't go. Stay with me for a while.
I want to be your -- your wife.	Huh?
I don't have a ring!	I know.
You don't like me?	I love you. I want to have your baby.
STUFF.  Got a light?	What kind of "stuff?"
Wait! He works for YOU?	Now. But first, he worked for you.
Sweet.	I thought so.
Who's that?	Jesus.
Maybe.	We do have a man for you.
Every week --	I'm dying.
You're not#	No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine.
What?	He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
Wait. I know you.	Yes?
#Well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place.	That's her job. You have to respect that.
I think that went as well as could be expected.	She always looked out for me.
Wait# He wants to give her#?	Nothing.
What do you think?	What are they?
What's this about not eating?	I don't want to eat!  And there's one more thing I don't want! Definitely! That's to see you.
Where are you taking me?	South America.
A time will come when you'll thank me for this.	I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious.  Where'd you meet him?	On the road.
No, thanks. We're not hungry.	Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry.
What do you think you're doing!	Huh?
Oh, yeah?	Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
Driver!	Yeah?
Tell that man not to drive so fast. 	Are you talking to me?
Here, boy!	What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?
Do you mind putting out the light?	Not at all. 
Oh, so now I was drunk!	Well, you were!
I better go over and see her.	Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old woman trip like this.
First town we hit in the morning, you better wire your father.	Not as long as I'm alive.
This looks like the best spot.	We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
What's the matter?	Oh, Peter
Sure.	What?
Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two.	When you get up to a hundred, wake me up.
I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.	Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
What're you going to do?	Mind your own business.
You might give me a little credit.	What for?
Any luck?	Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
Thank you.  Am I going to see you in New York?	Nope.
Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love?	Me?
Better go back to your bed.	I love you.
I hope you got your money.	You bet I did.
Maybe I could jump out of the window.  Do you think they'd see me?	Come here, you little fool!
No harm in your coming to see us.	Not interested. 
Where's the bus to New York?	Left twenty minutes ago.
Eight o'clock tonight.	Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
Here's your ticket, ma'am.	Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
Can I use your telephone? I want to talk to New York.	You ain't gonna stick me for no phone calls. You can go down to the Sheriff's office.
I've been thinking about you.	Yes?
Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.	Okay, pete. 
All I'm asking is enough gas to get me to New York. The bag's worth twenty-five dollars.	Yeah, but I got a bag. My wife gave me one for Christmas.
Funny couple, ain't they?	Yeah.
I told you! I told you, you couldn't trust him! He's gone!	Who?
See that. They're gone!	Looks like it, don't it?  Here's the woman, ma.
Not a minute!	Better start gettin' into your clothes.
Well, you're two up on me now. 	Hey, you!
Huh?	There's a seat over there for you.
Lucky thing, my running into you. Just the man I need.	You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
Did he pay you for this?	Twenty dollars each time.  Hell, it's no secret.  That's what I'm here for.
All right, all right.  Break it up.	Where you going, boss?
You know damn well who it is.	Dave?
I'm caught in the middle.  They're after me.  It's almost over.	Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want.
He asked me why I thought I was in danger and I said:	Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
I'm sorry.	I know.
Hi.	Tough day.
Did they live?	It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
Honey, come on.  The government wants you to be scared.  They want everybody to be scared to speak out.  They count on it.  But there's nothing to be scared of.	You and your government!  What's the matter with you?  Don't you have any feelings?  Your daughter!  What kind of man are you?
They killed him, honey.	Huh?
Oh no!# How bad?	No word yet.  But they think it's in the head.
Time?	Between six and seven seconds.
Pictures like this don't show up on television!	Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.
Here's my problem, Jack.  You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?	More than ten years.
How much more?	I don't know if I should talk about this.
No, she could get hurt.  If you believe what's happening to these other people.	She's the best damn witness we have!
Can I help you?	Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye on.
I understand.	Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."
What the fuck can I say? I'm serious, man. What the fuck can I say? Thank you# thank you# thank you.	Who was there for your ass?
I'd say there's about, oh, fifty thousand dollars here. What would you say Ray?	That looks like fifty thousand dollars from here.
What's going on?	She wants to make a deal.
Can I have a word with you?	Sure.
This is your money?	If I were to tell you "no it isn't#"
Hey, this is my office. There's no smoking.	Arrest me.
Help yourself.	While you're at it, let me see what else is in there. You mind?
You don't want much, do you?	Can you do it or not?
How was your flight?	Fine.
Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.	What's her name?
I can give you a lift home if you'd like?	Okay.
You're not tired of it?	I am, as a matter of fact.
He's the one who wants you.	It was the other guy who busted me.
If you're having some.	I am. Have a seat.
Thanks, but I have my own now.	You went out this morning and bought a gun?
What, I couldn't hear you?	You went out this morning and bought a gun.
Want to hear some music?	Sure.
I couldn't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair.	It looks nice.
This is pretty.	Uh-huh.
How do you get it out?	Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work.
How do you feel about getting old?	You're not old. You look great.
My ass ain't the same.	Bigger?
Well, hello.	Surprise.
What're you, a bag lady?	I go back to work tomorrow.
Don't even think about it. You could get yourself killed go to prison#	What if I've figured a way?
I didn't use you, Max.	I didn't say you did.
I'd feel a whole lot better if you took some more money.	You'll get over that.
Wanna go?	Thanks, but you have a good time.
He say we like the same thing as married.	Do you live together?
Most of the times.	Not every day?
Sometimes every day, for a while.	Then you don't see him for a few days?
Yes'm.	You know what's in the bag you're taking?
Oh, Miss Brown?	Yeah?
And what would this be, Sweet and Low?	What the fuck is that shit?
We'll just be a minute.	Can I smoke?
Oh, so now you know him?	You never asked me if I did or not.
That's fifty thousand, huh? It doesn't look like that much.	I was told ten thousand in each pack.
I thought I did.	You didn't. I would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till after.
Oh, hi.	Buy ya a beer?
For what?	Who you think got your ass outta jail?
The same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.	Hey, you get caught with blow, that's your business.
Yeah?	I didn't tell 'em anything.
What the hell you doin'?	Shut your ass up and grab the wall!
I just came here to talk.	Way I see it, me and you only got one thing to talk about. What you willing to do for me?
I got a problem#	All your money's in Mexico.
I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.	Talk to you tomorrow.
You told them that?	It's true, isn't it?
Drink?	I need to talk to you alone.
It's boring, isn't it?	I can sit through it once.
Want a hit?	Sure.
When did you get out of jail?	Four days ago.
Is it ready to go?	Yeah, there's another hit left.
Wanna fuck?	Sure.
Yeah, that really hit the spot.	Now that's over, let's get to know each other.
Is it dead?	Yeah.
Well, so far he is. But you have to admit he's not too bright.	I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
He killed a man worked for him the other night.	So what are you trying to tell me? I should get out of here?
That's not what I'm saying at all.  You know where he went?	No.
Please.	You live with him.
We're leaving now!	All right already.
What are you doin'?	I'm getting out of here. What do you think?
Thanks, Baby.	Who's your partner?
I'm going to wait in the car.	Sure.  We almost done, ain't we?
Take the keys, man. Listen to music.	Which one is for the car?
She tryin' to work your ass against me, ain't she?	Yep.
It's Louis.	Did you get it?
Louis?	What?
What'd you shoot her with?	It's in there.
Jesus Christ.	What?
I'm going out for a few hours.	Hold on a minute.  Where you going?
It's in my bag.	You have cash. What do you need me for?
Getting there.	You go wait in the car. Wait a minute.
Hey, Max.	Yes.
Comfortable?	The door was opened, so I just came right in.
Somebody already did.	What?
Where is it?	Is that what I think it is?
What's up with this shit.	I think falling in live with movie stars is something that happens to a man as he gets older.
It's the next street.	I know where it is.
My money's in that office, right?	Uh-huh.
Get that for me, will ya baby?	You know it's for you.
Hope you don't mind keeping him company.	No problem.
He ain't here right now.	He leave town?
Get me out of here.	Where do you want to go?
Remember?	No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then.
Dream on!	No! Oh God.
By who? Why? Paul didn't have an enemy in the world.	How do you know?
Too late. I've tried. I think you're right, Jake. I'm game.	Me, too.
Daddy!	Oh God!
You have an unusual hand.	I could have told you that.
You know, you got a strange line here.	It's short, huh?
What did he talk about when you guys went out? Did he say anything?	He was upset. He thought people were following him.
Wait # Daddy.	Now what?
Who's been talking to you? The army? Have they been talking to you, huh?	Nobody's been talking to nobody. You don't have a case, you hear me? It's pure and simple. Now leave me alone. Okay?
You mind? I'm eating, huh?	Something's going on here. You're not telling me something. What the hell's gotten into you?
What'd he say that for? What made him say that? Strange, huh? Strange.	What else did he say, Jake?
He say what they looked like?	No. Not really #
It's not worth goin' over again and again. Whatever happened, happened. It's over.	# I've seen them, too.
Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.	How do you know?
Ah, good. Now turn to your left.	She talk about the boys?
Loves me!? She hasn't said a kind word about me in years!	Right. She doesn't stop talking about you. You're always on her mind. That's love, Jake.
Half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself. Mark my words.  Well, you've done it to yourself this time, haven't you?	Am I dead, Louis?  Am I dead?
Perfect. We got it.  Okay. Let's just give it a little try. See if you can stand.	What? By myself?
What are you doing?	There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.
And how is your wife? Sarah, no?	I haven't seen her in months.
What a dream I was having. I was living with another woman # You know who it was?	I don't want to know.
I'm not dead. I am not dead.	No. Of course you're not. You've just hurt your back. That's all. You're going to be fine. It'll just take some time.
They stole it.	Who did?
I don't have to ask if you can feel that.	Goddamn it. I want Louis.
That help?	Thanks.
What do you think?	What do you mean?
Thanks.  What's that?	Your kid dropped it off.
Wait. Don't.	I don't like things that make you cry.
Jake!	How's it going?
I'm going home.	What's wrong?
Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake. The money. Things like that. Or your wife.	Why do you bring her up?
You okay?	I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
Can't you stop it?	If I could stop it, I'd stop it.
What's it say? A hundred and two?	I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.
What does it say?	It's gone to the top.
What the hell are you doin'?	Get your clothes off.
He's coming right over.	Coming here?
You're out of your mind. I'm not getting in there. I'd rather die.	That's your decision.
I can't do it.	What kind of man are you?
Don't gimme that.	Lie down!
Help me! Help me!	Here. I'll do it.
Jake.  You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine.	Am I home?
Why are you doing this to me? You can't just go away like that.	I can do anything I want.
Don't!	It might be for me.
This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever since I was a little girl. I never thought it would happen.	Stick with me, kid.
What're you # ? Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?	Sit down, Jake.
WHO ARE YOU?	How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
Why won't you answer me?	Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?	Sit down, Jake.
WHO ARE YOU?	How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
I can't move.	Just relax.
No. I'll take the other one.  Right. Well it's good to have you back. See you tomorrow, probably.	If you're lucky.
Clear the area. This is an order!	What is wrong with you?
Dream on!	What?!
Well, don't we look better this morning? That was a hard night, wasn't it?	Where am I?
This is not a dream! This is my life.	Of course it is. What else could it be?
Still married, Jake?	Nope.
That's as straight as I can put it. And don't tell me that I'm crazy 'cause I know I'm not. I'm goin' to Hell. They're comin' after me.	Who is?
It's okay, Paul. It's okay.	I don't know what to do.
Do you want me to get someone?	No. No. It's okay. I'm okay.
I have some ice from the machine.	Bring it in.
Asshole that does not count as a kill.	Yes it does.
Okay, enough of this shit.	Alright, asshole.
Goodbye old friend.	Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
His mother?	What?
Sergeant!	Get out of here!
Where the hell were you?!!	He came for me, I had to run!
Nice touch.	And you said high school was boring.
Better let me.	Where'd you get the gun?
Everyone okay?	I think I broke my arm.
We're not supposed to do that.	What are you gonna do, tell me?
Done!	Let's move out!
How many?	Bring 'em all. Let's move!
Where is#?	You tell me! She's only set one charge. And it's not finished!
Then what do we do?!	I don't know!
Hurry!	Faster! Don't we have another gun?
It bought us some time.	And now we're all out of it.
What the hell are you doing?	My job.
Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.	You just keep an eye out.
Sergeant!	What?
I'm with you kid.	Where is he?
I need to know what you know about this guy.	Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
Jesus, God!	Oh man, what the hell happened?
Report to weapons. We're going on a hunt.	Roger that.  Time to kick some ass!
Where are you going?	We have to get off this ship.
Don't just stand there! Shoot him!	No you don't!
What if you miss?	What if we don't?
I couldn't save them.	Well, we'd be dead without you. You know that, don't you?
See? We're not so bad.	Not so bad.
Got it.  You ever space walked?	Oh sure, all the time.
You okay?!	Oh great#yeah, having a great time, and you?
It's time.	What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
Well?	She needs a little time.
Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!	No shit. I got no problem with that.
I feel better. Now how do you fire this damn thing?	Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!
It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up!	I'm on my way.
Okay?!!	Just come on, I've got an idea.
Oh, shit. He's going to see us.	Well, do something!
Push off toward us.	Forget her, she's a pain in the ass. Let her hang there.
I#I don't know what I did#	You lost the charge?
They're not gonna make it. Close the door before he gets us all.	They'll make it.
Now this is getting exciting.	Remember to roll his balls around a bit.
Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .	Just get us to the ship!
You think it killed . . .  Yeah, I guess not.	Let's just get out of here.
Hurry! She's lost it!	So what else is new?
I don't know#sorry?	Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.
I didn't say I was good at it.	Oh shit! There he is!
It's just you and me, then.	Come here, might as well fix that arm.
Yo, Teach, what the fuck?	We're missing two of the kids!
Leave him behind!	No! He's coming with us!
I don't understand#what does he want?	He wants to kill you#and me#and everyone on this ship.
How do you know?	I just know.
Something's wrong.	Keep trying!
The power's back up!	Then open the doors!
Damn!  Close the door! I'll be right back.	What?!!
You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?	We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found.
You're not going anywhere.	You wanna die?
What good will that do?	They can deal with this sort of thing.
How do you open the damn door?	You're crazy!
Can we get through these?	Sure but what good will that do?
Guys, he's right behind us!	It's okay.
Did you bring a check?	What?
Why are we way out here, when the shark's back there?	#'cause this is where he lives. You gotta think like they do.
I never saw one that big.	What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?
He's comin' up -- !	He's taken him!
Right.	Do you see the kids?
Don't forget these.	Oh, yeah.  How do I look? Older, huh?
Love ya.	Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.
It's three feet deep, Martin	Michael! Come inside!
You too, sweetheart#	Thank you.
Why don't we have one more drink, you and I, and then we go down and cut open that old shark and see for sure what's inside him, or not.	Can you do that?
Home# New York?	No. Home here.
He lost it on the way up.	What kind of a shark did you say it was?
We ought to let it breathe# Whatever.	Let's all have a drink.
#Nothing.	What do we do?
What happened?	I want to check something. Hold my feet.
I hope we get some more help.	I wish it would rain#
Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy on his own blood already!	I can't stand here doing nothing!
We're not even sure what it was.	What else could've done that?
One more after this, then I'm going home.	Set?
You do this all the time, right, Charlie?	Twenty years.
Would you like something? Some coffee?	Is anyone having this#?
Over there!	What do you see?
I'll drink to your leg.	And I'll drink to yours.
He's heading under -- !	No way! He can't!
Follow him!	He's under!
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?	I don't think so.
Oh, I couldn't copy your work.	But you copy my work every week.
What's up?	I just wanted to come over. You know, say hi. I miss hanging out with you on school nights.
Wait, let me take that.	Huh?
What? I'm not made of stone.	Well, there we have it. Would you like to know the sex?
No.	Cool. Well, let's sit down and get to know each other a bit.
So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this# thing.	Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?
Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?	The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby#	Hey, I like this.
Cool.	Come on, I have something for you.
What?	I actually know this one.
Oh, okay. Like this.	You've never been to a dance, have you?
No.	No?
What#	This is the baby. Your baby.
Hi. I'm here for the big show?	Your name, please?
I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.	I have no idea what kind of girl I am.
What?!	Either I just pissed my pants or#
God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now?	Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
You don't say.	Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?
What did you do?	I didn't do anything# I just# I've just been thinking.
What would be a good time for you?	I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.
We're actually, finally doing this?	Looks like it, yeah.
You lose!	I suppose anything's possible.
#Pardon?	#I said, I like your hair.
You wouldn't have any color film, would ya?	#Yeah, sure.
I told you how Early feels 'bout a woman drinking.	How'd you meet Early?
I'm cool.	Could I try that?
You took this picture?	Took 'em all.
That's me.	No it is not!
You shouldn't let him do that to you#	Do what?
Well# for one thing# They think faster out there, on account of all that warm weather they got; cold weather makes people stupid, that's a fact.	I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready.	I heard that.
Yeah but, what is it?	I don't know, they didn't speak too good English.
What's wrong with her?	She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen.
You think I'm goin' to kill you. Well that'd make me a liar then wouldn't it?	No sir.
Tight fit.	Best kind.
Can't hurt.	How much do I owe you?
That bad?	#Then some.
Sure.	Ain't you goin' to record it?
By the way, I'm not much of a pool player.	Shit, it ain't hard to play pool. I can teach you everything ya need ta know.
#Well then, that's how many I killed.	If you say so.
Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.	The party?
Hey. I didn't have the heart to wake you.	Thanks. What are you doing?
So how's it going?	#I think it's the best stuff I've done.
#and I think I know why.	Why?
I like that.	I still think we should have met them first.
We could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes#	Hey, I got some great stuff# it's okay.
All set?	Fuck!
What is it?	Look again!
There's more#	I'm finished.
You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you.	I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
What about you?	I don't know.
#never?	No, never. Excuse me.
Early, just think#	Shut your mouth.
What happened?	Who are you?
Shit.	Was up bitch?
What do you think?	You fucked it?
Well, how was it?	Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.
You know what else?	What?
And I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this girl is a baby.	Yeah.
Shit.	What do you want?
You wanna go to Paul's house?	What for? That guys a dick.
Man, this guy is really good.	He looks like my uncle.
I don't understand why you do that.	Why I do what?
So really, it's good luck.	Good luck?
How much you gonna take?	I don't know. How much do you want?
About ten. Fifteen is good.	Fifteen for me.
Yo, you think we killed that guy?	Na.
I don't know. I just never seen girls that did that shit before. But I think it looks nice.	Yeah. Do it again.
Hey.	Hey. What are you doin' right now?
You know I've been thinking about you lately.	You have?
I was lookin' for you all day today.	You were?
I thought you had a girlfriend.	Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
I don't even want to talk, but I gotta tell you that when I first saw you last week, I, I couldn't stop thinking about you. You've been stuck in my head.	Come on.
I'm nervous.	Trust me. Don't be nervous.
I like you so much. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't believe it.	How do you know?
Nothing. I'm telling you I just want to make you happy. That's all. Just trust me.	I don't want you to hurt me.
You know what I want to do?	Yeah.
Dance!	What?
No. I'm OK. Thanks.	You're OK?
Yep, yep. But he has to know what he's doing and where he's going. Because they can like touch you for hours and they won't ever know.	Hell yeah, they don't know.
Wish me luck.	Good luck.
I'm coming.	No. I just gotta go find him.
Just a lot of crazy shit.	Yeah?
You know# You know a lot of times sex gets in the way. Has that ever happened to you?	Yep.
Yeah.	It's like#
Yep.	But then the sex gets into the way and you're like: What happened! What the hell happened?!
Yep.	Holy shit. That's all true?
Sorry. Dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job.	But then I won't need your money.
What are you guys doing?	Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
So, how many people live here now?	I don't know, eight or nine.
Yeah. And it takes them either too long or too short to come. Have you ever had someone that took forever	To come?
By yourself?	Yes.
We seem to have a little problem here?	What kind of problem?
Are you crazy?	Let's see how much he wants to play.
We didn't ask for your opinion, Doctor.	Maybe you should.
You don't tell us how to run our investigation.  You got that?	You don't have an investigation without me.  You got that?
You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it.  You think I'm right?	I wouldn't know.
You got it on the board.	No, I need the original note.
He's not talking about himself.	Then what's he talking about?
Yes you are.	Get off me!
The message!  I figured out--	Sit down!
Sorry.	Anything?
You still having a problem with this?	Yeah, I am.  I think he's playing us. If I was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else?
A few people.	Did anyone stand out?
It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.	But a hundred men could move him.
Don't fuck with us!  Where did you go!	He was with me?
We'll find the evidence.	You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
Hello, Peter.	Who is this?
Hello, Peter.	Just a second.  Hello?
I did another one last night.  You might have saved her, but you didn't want to play.	Where is she?
I suppose you want to know where I'm going to kill tonight, Peter?	You're not going to tell me that.
Hello?	Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.
I'm sure there are other people who would be interested in what I have to say.	Then call them!
Have you any idea what the message is?	If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
Hello.	Last night was very exciting, wasn't it?  Have you figured out what I'm doing?
I know where you are.	Very good.  How did you know?
How'd you know I wouldn't be in the same room with her?	You told me.  When you called you said she was in the other room.  Drop the knife.
What's this?	Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.
Nope.  Nothing.	Set up some pieces on the big board?
It worked out alright, didn't it?	Fuck off!
Feeling better?	I just can't believe it.
Why did he?	Why did he what?
So, are you having a good time on the Island?	Not really.  It's pretty boring.
Do you like my dad?	Of course.
I know he really likes you.	How do you know that?  Did he say something?
Okay.  Nice meeting you.	Nice meeting you.
What is it, dad?	Nothing.
Don't you have something you want to say to David?	Thanks, David.
You ready?	For what?
Same as the others?	Yeah.
Well?	Well what?  I told you this was a stupid idea.  You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
I'm busy right now.	It's important.
No.  I told him to.  I wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end.	But we heard him.
You never know how you're going to catch a suspect.	Peter's right, Captain.  He's got to be forced into making a mistake.
What time did he get there?	About a quarter to one.
Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier?	I don't know.  I was afraid there'd be hours of questions.  I can't afford to miss a game.
You want me to go with you?  Maybe I can help.	That's alright.  We'll take it from here.
Where were you last night?	Are we going to go through this again?
Don't you understand what I'm telling you?  That's why he wants me out of the way.	I understand that this is just another one of your games.
Did you send the car?	It's over, Peter.  Let's stop the games.  I'm not sending a car.
You have something you want to say?	Just thought you might want to talk.
Sorry.  I thought it was empty.	It's alright.
Is this your first time here?	Yes.
I love this hotel.  I stay here every time I visit my parents.	How come you don't stay with them?
Well, I think I've had enough.	Getting too hot in here for you?
You sure you don't want to eat something?	I don't think I could.
It's going to be a long night.  It could take hours before we know something.  You should try to eat.	You sound like my mother.
I think it's interesting.	Another kind of game?
I'm just curious.	I think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions -- I want to keep things on a professional level.
No.	You're not?
Relax.	How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw.
I know you didn't	You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
What?	Have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games.
I just don't want to fight with you.	Then show me who you are.
I'm hungry.	Call room service.
Fine.	What do you want on it?
Did you call?	The line was busy.  I'll try again.
Hi.	Can I come in?
Peter#	No, listen.  You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.
This letter.  I've never opened it.	Why not?
If we could just figure out what the next word is going to be.  He said the game's going to end tonight so there's only going to be one more word.	It could be anything.
How did you know it was "carefully"?	Frank told me.
You're right.  The killer told me.	He didn't tell you either.
This isn't going to be like the phone book, is it?	Of course not.
You're going to be late for your match.	Are you going to come tonight?
You beat him.	I got lucky.
It's over now.	I just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future.
I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.	I don't have to go through with it either.
I don't trust you to wash behind your ears.	Never mind my ears! Go away!
I lied.	About what?
That's a better one.	Yes.
You will go alone.	I won't leave you here.
I can't reach her.	What do you see?
From here, I must go alone.	You will tell me her name and we will go together.
It is today?	Yes. It is today.
Once is enough, thank you.	He saved our lives.
And where do you lead, boy?	To the place where Death lives.
When did you last sleep, boy?	I'm all right.
Go, join them.	What kind of friend do you think I am?
You!	Me.  May I eat with you tonight?
We meant only to please you.	And do you think I'm not going to eat myself to death this very night? Huh?
Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so ugly.	Would you desert your friends?
He will come for me.	He will not come. You will be my queen.
A girl of some spirit, your daughter.	A match for your son, I think.
I'll stay behind and keep them busy.	It is not necessary. They will not follow.
It is fifty years since I heard that name.	It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
You see?	Yes.
Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.	Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
What's that man's name?	Why do you want to know?
YEAH! I was sure! Come on, tell me! I know him?	No.
#You moved too, didn't you?	Yeah.
No, no.	Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?
Take#	Well, I don't need them#
OK, I'm fine.	Good.
Wow! It's brilliant!	Yeah#  Come on, have a little training.
Good! First shot!	Yeah, but I didn't get him, I got his case and now he's behind the tree. What can I do?
It's incredible! How did you do it?	What?
Five minutes. Keep in front of the window.	OK.
Come on, get down!	You were scared, weren't you?
Why don't you take me with you?# I'm ready, now.  You said I learn very quickly.	Quick doesn't mean "ready". And you can't discuss, we said. Right?
Not taken.	Why?
Stop. Everyone is looking.	Of course, so kiss me quickly, or they'll notice us.
#You don't believe me, don't you?	What?
#Shit!!  We'd found him. We waited for him to get upstairs and he got out of the window.	What shall we do?
#Don't you drink?	I prefer waiting for a while#  I feel it would go the wrong way.
#No#	#Don't you like me?
You# You knock the code, when you come back, OK?	Yes.
May I ask you a personal question?	#Yes.
How shall we get out now, Leon?	Let me work. We'll get out, I tell you!
Don't fear.	I have no fear.
How are you, Miss?	Fine#
You can't sit here like that.	Huh? Why?
Do you recognize him?	#Even his mother wouldn't.
He probably just went somewhere.	Where?
And your store?  What about your new store?  What about all your dreams?	I have new dreams now.
What if you don't make it?	I'll make it.
Are you two planning kids?	Maybe later.
I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle.	How serious is it?
Then it'll have to wait until I finish.	What?
I have to finish first.	I won't let you die.
Mine.	Are you and your friends planning on driving soon?
I know what you're getting at.	You do?
Yes?	The flowers# they're beautiful.
You thought I sent them?	There was no card.
Have I forgotten something?  Is this a special day?	It's just a regular day.
Ellen?	What?
I do love you# very, very much.	Show me.
I thought we both wanted the same things.	I've changed my mind.
I want children.	You've just decided, is that right?
I don't know.	I think it's a different place for each person.
I know where my heaven is.	Where?
What did they ask?	If I had seen you.  By the way I'm sorry about your wife.  They told me.
Why?	Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
Your parents would want you to be in bed.	You tell stories?
Three thousand miles?# How many times does twenty go into three thousand?	What was that?
Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat.	By car right?
When are you leaving?	Tomorrow.
Ellen told me that she didn't know if I loved her.	She knew you loved her.
There are a lot of people worried about you.	Where am I?
You're in pain.	I need your help.
# My father.	Did you tell him everything you wanted to?  Did you do everything you could while he was here?
You're going to have a lot of work to do when I get back.	Someone should be with you.
Good morning.	Good morning.
Is it a boy or a girl?	Oh, that's not mine.
May I ask you a question that might sound strange?	Yes.
I've always wanted a watch like that.	It's yours.
I really want that watch.	This isn't right.
Hello!	Hello.
That is, if you'll come to my room for an hour, I will give you five hundred dollars.	Maybe you shouldn't stand in the road like that. You're pretty drunk.
Mind if I use the bathroom?	Of course.
What's the story? Are you too drunk to come?	I don't care about that. There's time left. You can have more money. You can drink all you want. You can talk or listen. Just stay, that's all I want.
No, I came here to drink# myself# you know#	To death?
What's up?	I was looking for you tonight. I don't know if you have a boyfriend#
#or a girlfriend, but if you have some free time# maybe we could have dinner.	Are you serious.
Yes.	I have to change and take a shower first. If you want to come home and wait.
First. It's our first. I'm just concerned. So# why are you killing yourself?	Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.
Don't you like me, Ben?	Don't be silly?
Ben?	Sorry.
Why?	Because# it's better for me that way. OK?
Giving you money makes me want to come.	Then come.  I'm going to change. Watch TV. I'll be half an hour.
I am planning to go out and do some work.	When?
Why don't you go back to sleep. I'll go out and buy us some breakfast.	Be careful.
Your color.	I think you should wear one at a time. One of these# and one of your others. In fact, I was going to buy just one, but I didn't think it would fly# as a gift, I mean.
What was that all about?	Can we just forget it?
Please!	Yes# I'll give you that.
I'll be back home around three. If you're back by then we can watch TV or something# I guess what I'm saying is# that I hope you are back when I get home. Please be careful.	You be careful to. I'm going to miss you.
I like it here with you.	Let's stay for a while.
You know I love you# yeah?	Yes.
Hey, Brad# how's it going?	Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.
So# are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous?	Alone. Alone. I'm here alone.
Please don't raise your voice. I won't bother you about it again.	Sorry. Look# you seem like a nice girl. I'm just sick of everyone in this town trying to get my money.
You have been lonely?	I've been all right.
Where have you been?	It was a slow night. I went to a hotel for a few drinks.
Have you told anyone that I'm here?	No.
Were you with another man?	Go to hell.
What're you so happy about? You're on trial for murder.	Get up.
Is he always such an ass?	He's the top defense attorney in the state. Of course he's an ass.
I got out of the shower, walked downstairs, saw her standing over my father, and called the police.	Did she have a weapon in her hand?
Did you hear a shot fired?	No. I was in the shower.
Did you get it?	Yes. But I can't tell you what it is.
Good work today, Ms. Woods.	Thank you!
Sit down.	Is everything okay?
You're not going up there.	Yes, I am.
Why didn't you call me?	What?
-- his life?	I don't know.
I didn't even get to go to his birthday party.	No!
You ready?	No.
I'm a bitch.	Yes, you are.
Honey, stop! You have to leave this room -- it's been a week.	So?
Hello! You're like, a lawyer.	Not yet.
Good luck.	Thanks again for your help!
Don't ask.	I wasn't gonna --
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?	No, she can't move for an hour.
Oh, my God!	Oh, my God!!
Someone missed you.	Is he the only one?
How could this happen?	I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
Almost.	Well, hurry up so you can come home! We miss you!
Neither.	Why not?
Yes? Ms. Woods?	I changed my mind. I'd pick the dangerous one.
You don't really believe she's innocent?	Of course, I do!
You're beautiful.	So are you!
C'mon. Let me take you home.	No.
What're you talking about? You're not here to see me?	No, silly. I go here.
Good. Good.	Do anything exciting?
You look -- nice.	Thank you.
It made me realize something. I'm an idiot.	Really?
There he is!	Pull up next to him!
Why so few?	Faith.
God protect me.	Not from me, surely#
Damn you!	We're both of us damned, my beauty.
When the time's come, you won't need to jump, I'll throw you out myself!	Do it now!
What is it?	Something's coming.
We must follow that bird.	Whatever for?
My God!  Look!	Something the matter?
Can we trust him?	No# but what choice have we?
One more turn#	That's it!
Ride like wild fire, Jack.	He'll not escape me.
These for me?	If you like.
You promised!	Never.
Oh, dear.	What's the matter?
How much longer?	Shhh!
What have I done?	Only what's right#
Sweet Jack.  I'm so sorry you found me asleep.  Don't know what came over me.	I can't have been under much more than a minute.
What do we do now?	We wait.
Master Jack!  Master Jack!  These woods are alive!  They're alive!	Of course they're alive.  All nature is living.
Where?	Up ahead!
Sorry, Jack.	It's done# we'll never catch him.
You're with us in battle.	May God protect you.
No hurt Jimmy, sir# oh no, please, sir#	I'm sending you back to Hell!
Let that be our problem, just get us there.	You follow.
Are you going to see Sam again?	I thought I might stop by.
And video games after!	Home after.  Will you come in and say "hi"?
That's how you get things right is to always try and never give up.  Huh, Mom?	I guess it depends on what you give up on.
He's not there.	He's here.  Check the bathroom.
When does George get to come see his house?	It's so beautiful.
What's that for?	Mom said I should.
He hasn't called?	Who are you?
Mom?	Here, honey!
I put him to work.	What's wrong?
What are you doing up so early?	I couldn't sleep last night.
Sorry I got you into trouble.	I'll survive.
He must.	He seems lonely.
Don't you have school?	Nope.
My keys.	What's that?
You have to ask like that?	I want you to try something with me, okay?
My mother would die.	Let's shut up and not kill her.
It's not what I was expecting.	What did you think it would be?
I'm hungry!  Where's my dinner?  Who ate my dinner?  Huh?  Who's in trouble now?	Hi.
Hey.	What are you doing here?
They're trying to make me spend the summer here.  I'm leaving in the morning.	Where to?
You should stay.	I don't know.
Do you remember me from when you lived here?	Yeah.
Huh?	I can use your mom's.
Really?	He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.
This is serious!  I don't have my license.  He was my ride.	I'm sorry.  I'm just here to shower.
What's the point of this?	Does everything have to have a point?
Are you sure you're totally into guys?	What are you talking about?
Hey, I can get you three hundred cash for two hours.	What?
I don't wanna go.	He asked where you were!  He wants you with him.
Why is that?	Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
He won't leave my room.	Will he talk to me?
I assume you'll fill the#uh, window, with glass?	If that's what it takes.
That would take weeks.	Months.
I'm good, thanks.	What are you on?
I've been here twenty years.	Maybe that's too long.
Oh.	How old are you?
Listen#maybe I can get you a year.	I hate this job.
I've got one favor to ask.	What can I do for you, George?
Sam?	Uh huh.
Thanks for the shower.	I want you both to stay.
If she's not up, you can use my shower.	Thank you.
I forgot where I put my keys.	And you thought they might be under her dress?
Hello?	Where are you?  You're driving me crazy, waiting like this.  I want you in me now!
Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.	You'll know me by the time we're through.
Mom, tell him I'm not going.  You already promised me!	You have everything?
I'm not going!	You don't have a choice.
I want you to take out your nose ring and leave it out.	Why?
I don't know.	I'm gonna take a walk.  I need some money.
No one would blame me if I left!	I'd blame you.  I want you here.
If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money.	You'll have money when you work for it.
I'm leaving.	Hey#hey!
Where are you going?	I don't know.
Where is it?	A friend of yours is here.
I know the feeling.	How do you become something you're not?
I wish you had told me then.	I'm telling you now.
I loved him too much.	After everything he did to you and your mom?
You look better than ever.	I don't think Mom cares that much that my#that Peter left.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?	The kind where there isn't really an answer.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?	The kind where there isn't really an answer.
And you told Mom today?	Yes.
I don't wanna go, Sam.	Here.
I'd eat a lot of red meat.	Good for you.
What would you do?	I'd build a house.
I'm surprised he hasn't left.	I haven't forced him to work.  I only wet him down once.  Why would he leave?
I just wanted to know where Mom was?	Oh.  Sorry.
Lock the door behind you.	Where is he?
What are you doing?	He doesn't answer.
He never answers.	Why does he have a lock on his door?
Hey, hey!	I'm married.
What was I supposed to do?  When you didn't show up Saturday, I tried to call. Your phone isn't working.	I don't have a phone.
I did say he could go.	Let's go.
It makes me sad.	What?
What is it?	I'm fine.  Nothing.  I'll drop by your lunch tomorrow.
I thought you'd be up with the sun.	My stupid back.
Where's Sam?	He won't use my shower.  I don't get it.
You brought your kids?	I kind of said that maybe they could do something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They really wanted to come.  I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  I don't think they'll be too much trouble.
Do you need help?	I think so.
It's been a while.	This was my very first slow dance.
Let's see if you've gotten any better.	Oh, I'm worse.  Much, much worse.
I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George.	How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
Nothing is going on with us, is it?	Going on?
I'm married.	You bit my finger.
Let's not do this, okay?	I need to know.
Is your back still killing you?	I didn't think you'd come today.
Back.  Neck.  Back.	What?
I could die.	So could I.
Are you going to kiss me?	It's not my back that's killing me.
Don't move!	I'm an idiot to have you up there.
I better get the kids home.	Not a perfect day.
Been thinking?	No.
He already knows everything about what he can't do.  You can tell him not to even look at you, if you want.	I'm thinking it's too weird now.
It's just a joke.  A stupid joke.	I could use the money.
What the fuck?	Everything happens for a reason.  That's what my dad said.
The biggest waste of time since television.	Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?
I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall.	Sooner than the Fall.
I'm helping George build his house.	What?
I can't go right now.	You can't go because of Sam?
I was talking about our marriage.	I know.
Where are the kids?	Sam took them to a movie.
No.	Take it off.
Do it now!	If I walk out the door, who's gonna be here tonight for the follow through?
You don't look like you.	Either do you.
I thought I might be able to help, but it looks like you have all you can handle.	Do you like red?
Hey.	Hey.
I've missed you guys.	Why?
Do you know anything about building a house?	No.
What are you doing in my room?	I didn't go in your room.
The door was open.	I don't know what I'm doing.
You're sure about this?	Yeah.
Why do we have to get up and eat with you this early?	I just thought it would be nice.
All day again?	Not all day.  I'll be home after lunch.
Ryan, would you rather swim or work?	Can we really help build a house?
I brought a few of my own.	Someone stop her!
Adam, that's not true!	Yes, it is.
Go tell your father we're eating.	Dad's home, already?
A night in the hole?	Better make it a week.
Look, I am truly sorry about this. I'd like to help you#	But you can't.
She always said that if you were on the outside#	But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
Forty years. That's a long time for any crime, even murder.	It's a hell of a lot longer when you're innocent.
Come on, honey, let's get out of here.	But I'm having a good time#
I've never seen you in here before.	That's because I've never been here before.
Don't I know you?	I don't think so.
What?	Nothing.
I said you're soft.	Hey, man, don't ever call me that.
Nice meeting you? You've been here before, haven't you?	What gave you that idea?
Hey, Ray. I've been looking for you.	Here I am.
I think he's hurt pretty bad.	He's dead.
What do you think you're doing?! The man's been dead for two seconds! Don't you have any respect?	It ain't here.
I wouldn't do that if I was you.	Shut up. It's too damn hot. What do you know, anyway?
You did it, man! You got us out! Next stop, New York City!	New York's a long way's off. Let's just keep moving, okay?
Come on, Ray, time to go!	I'm stuck!
Don't mention it.	Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now#
We'll just get off at the next stop.	Say what?
Give me back that hot dog. I'll eat it myself.	What am I gonna eat?
What the hell are you doing?	Don't touch that car.
No, I'm gonna kill him --	No, believe me, I'm gonna kill him!
I can't do it.	That's because you're soft. Gimme the gun.
Why don't he just tell 'em the truth?	He knows nobody wants to hear the truth.
I can't eat this.	Why the hell not?
How you doin'?	I'm all right.
He's from New York City. That one, too.	New York. That's up north, ain't it? They'll find we do things different down here.
Looks like we got a couple of live ones. How long these boys in for?	Judge gave 'em the long ride.
All in, boss!	Move it out.
Must have been some time ago. Maybe forty years?	Something like that, yes.
Appreciate it.	Anybody else need anything read?
Um, excuse me, we're having a private conversation here.	Yeah, get out of here! Beat it!
We could create our own hell there.	You saying we go up there and kill everyone?
No!	Don't do it!
But what about the cash? Can we keep it or what?	Sure, why not?
Keep it up and I just might make you my Queen for a night or two.	You want a queen? Got one right here.
Oh. My. God. I can't believe you're here. Welcome. Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now.	So excited.
I'll call her later.	You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.
How did you see me?	We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
I gotta help her. I gotta help Dad. I gotta help everybody.	Yeah, you do#
What is it?	I'm not a hundred percent on that. God said when the time comes, you'll know what to do.
Did you just talk?	No.
Where is he? He's late.	He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.
So far, so good. Now what?	Put it in your mouth.
You'll be alright. Go on. Big day tomorrow. Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about.	Got ya.  Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?
I didn't murder anybody	Look. You were really high. Things happen.
Knock, knock.	Yes, Jimmy.
No. This can't be happening.	Son, just do your best.
Sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time.	'Bout time#
Which way did he go?	That way.
Please. You got to.	All right#
Good idea# kill me.	Dude. Seriously?
You gotta kill yourself.	I'll just go to Heaven.
This town is really going to hell lately.  So what part of the city do you live in?	I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.
I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.	School?
Do me.	I love you.
Why is that funny?	I don't know.
It looks like the work of a brother#	A black guy?
That just hurt a lot.	I've always wanted to kill someone. Can I do it?
Hey#	See something you like, my man?
We're hungry do you have anything to eat?	Anything to eat?
How do you think we got here??!!	You walked in. I saw you. Don't you remember?
Where do you think we came from?	From? From? From?
Hiding? Yes! Hiding, hiding.	Where do we go?!  Where do we go from here??!!
How do you want us?	Up there.
Do you have anything special in mind?	I don't care# Just get it over with.
You are here. I couldn't believe it when they told me. What are you doing?	Turn this way.  No, no# not you# YOU!
You missed something special.	Well# you can't have them all.
Who invited you?	I'm in my party mood.
Let's have sex.  I thought you were curious.	Not about that.
You could have called me yourself.	But I wasn't sure you'd come.
I couldn't get you out of my mind.	I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?	You know.
Why show me?	I'm going to run.
Are you here to help me?	What do you need?
What're you going to do?	That's tomorrow.
If you did know, you'd tell me.	Of course --
I'd rather be with you.	That's nice.
Just follow -- no matter how it seems#	But what is this -- why?
Are you taking me to them?	Yes.  I don't know what else to do -- with him following us.  Why do you keep running from your --
How do we know this is the right way?	It's the only way.
What's that?	It feels like breath. It makes everything move. Your hair is moving.
I hate outside! I hate it!	We'll be all right#  We will#
Don't!	Sooner or later, we'll have to try something.
It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.	Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these.
Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?	I doubt it.
It all seemed to make sense until Box.	Do you think he was telling the Truth?
You're right# it must be near now. We'll find it.	Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?
Look at his face# and his hair#  Is that what it is to grow old?	It could be#
We'll have to bury him.	What's that?
Come with us.	Where are you going?
Goodbye.	Oh, my#
How long have you been living here?	For as long as I can remember.
How did you get here?	I have always been here#
But there may be a few around somewhere.	What makes you think so?
Where are they?	Dead# they're dead# and buried.
They're beautiful. May I have one too please?	No -- I'm sorry. It's not possible.
What's beyond this place -- do you know?	No, no, no
Are you ready to put him in?	Not yet.
Is that really it? It doesn't seem very far. Will we be there soon?	I promise. We'll go on as soon as it's light.
I know#  We're going to try and get in this way. I don't think you can make it.	Oh# I did so look forward to seeing all those people.
You want somethin'?	No, I'm okay.
You okay, man?	What?
Pete# You okay?	Yeah.
I'm, okay# You okay?	Sure, I'm okay.
Do you always sleep here?# In this room?# Both of you?	This is our bedroom.
I like to remember things my own way.	What do you mean by that?
Very strange.	What is?
Do you own a video camera?	No. Fred hates them.
Might be a good time to try using it again.	Anybody else have a key to the house.
We'll keep a watch on the house.	As best we can.
Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to.	Yeah.
What a fuckin' job.	His or ours?
I was here yesterday.	Yeah, I remember.
I want more.	Me, too.
Hello.	It's me#
Pete?	Me, too.
He'll kill us.	Are you positive he knows?
You like it?	No, honey# It was part of the deal.
You liked it.	If you want me to go away, I'll go away.
So, should I call Andy?	Andy?
Set.	Why are ya goin' so early?
Are you my man?	Yes.
You got him.	Alice, I#
You all right?	We killed him.
Alice#	We gotta get the stuff and get out of here.
I don't. I don't know him.	Dick can't be dead. Who told you he was dead?
Hey.	Sit down a minute.
Never saw him before in my life.	Did you tell the police this?
Please tell me.	No.
Just rest easy, Pete. You're gonna be okay.	Are you hungry, honey? I'll fix you something.
Where's Pete?	Out in back.
I wouldn't know how.	You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
Pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?	Pete, what happened to you?
Do you remember?	No# I don't. Why?
What's the matter?	Nothin'.
We know that.	Who was the man?
Who is it?	He won't give his name.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?	I# I didn't say anything#
Something wrong?	My# My head.
We've met before, haven't we?	I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
Where's Alice?	Alice who?
You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight?	What are you going to do?
It's nice to know I can still make you laugh.	I like to laugh, Fred.
Good book, huh?	Huh?# oh, yeah, it is.
I had a dream about you last night#	Yeah?
You're up early.	That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
What's that? Another tape?	Yes, I just found it on the step.
Don't you want to watch it?	I guess so.
We've got to call the police.	All right.
We will.	Thanks, guys.
What the hell is going on?!	I wish I knew.
What was that?!!!	What?
No, I don't remember anything. it looks like I# but# I don't remember.	Why would anyone do something like this?
Where would you feel safe?	I don't know. Maybe a hotel.
I thought you were getting me a drink?	Just a minute.
Let's go home.	But#
I told you to stay in the car!	Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?
Give that a try.	All right!
How ya doin', Pete?	Okay.
Hello.	Hey, Pete# How ya doin'?
You sure you're doin' okay? Everything all right?	Yeah.
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?	At your house. Don't you remember?
I missed you.	Yeah?#
Why haven't you called me?	Sorry# I#
What's happening to you? What happened to your face?	I don't know.
You still care about me?	Sure. Sure I do.
What else about that night?# Did anything happen?	You really don't remember?
What do you want?	Nothin'# You want to go for a drive?
Where'd you come from?	I've been here. You were lookin, right at me.
All of it?	Yes. Might as well - all of it.
Two years!?	Yes.
Yes, it just shows I don't know why I'm talking to you. I don't know you. Who are you?	Okay, brother.
Where are they? Do you see them?	Yes!
What are we going to do?	Well, there's nothing we can do until the morning.
I say, will you have a cigarette?	No.
Hey, what's happened to you?	Nothing. Why?
If you want me to!	Sure - sure. Don't you worry. I'll take care of you.
Hey - look!	Look, Bob!
Yes. I'm afraid it does.	Shall we have another?
Charming, isn't she?	Yes, charming.
Please calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do.	I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
Are you taking me?	Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!
No, I can't! I can't! You've got to let me rest! You've got to let me rest!	Hey!
Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.	I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
All right, go ahead!  We go on to the next plane. Bring out any people that are left.	Right, Bob.
Bob, these are all that are left.	Come on! Quick! This way.
Just what I needed too.	You?
Oh George, come on.	It's not knowing that's so awful, Bob. Not knowing where you're going, or why, or what's waiting when you get there.
He's dead.	Dead?
What is it?	See that spot?
George, what do you think you're doing?	Let me go, Bob!
Let me up! Let me up!	All right. Sorry, George.
Well, I - I really don't know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad.	So you think I'm mad?
Look here, Bob, Ever since I can remember, you've looked after me. Now I think you're the one that needs looking after. I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something wrong with you, let me help you.	Oh, George . . .
You can't take her away from here!	Why not?
I guess we're in for it.	In for what?
There are so many questions I'd like to ask you, I hardly know where to begin.	I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
I'm thirty.	Oh, you're going to make life very simple.
Why, he's speaking English.	English!
How about you? Do you want to go?	Go? Where?
You promised to come for tea yesterday. I waited for so long.	I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
You shot an eight year old girl.	Uh# yes.  Apparently I did, air.
#touch that.	What the hell#
Only the damn guy won't know it.	What happens if I say no?
We'll take it from here.	What?  Who the hell are you?
I'm just saying it was cold.  I think she kind of liked me.	She didn't even know you. .
What?	Something seem unusual to you about that?
Something's wrong here.	Gee.  You really think?
Looks like a train ticket.	Where to?
Jesus#	Get back in the car!
Oh, yeah?  Fill us in, why don't you.	What if he's telling the truth?
He's here to help!?	Yes.  Well, in his own mind, yeah.  What if, from his point of view, he is?
Since how long?	Since as long as we've been keeping records#
Maybe they didn't get here.  Maybe they've been here.	For how long?
Yeah.  His dream and our worst nightmare.	You know, there's something we never really thought of#
Sure.	Me, too.  I feel a long day coming on.
I swear to God, that was not here two days ago#	What is it?
Found it.	Tell us the truth.  You don't just find these things, at least not in this neighborhood.
Which way?	Seriously.  I'm not going any further until you tell who you are.
Now, what are we looking at?  Keys.  Look at them all.  Why do we have them?  Mr. President?	Well, uh# so we can got into things, I guess.
What?	They're inside.
Drop some money.	Forget that guy --
No.  Follow him.	He'll turn around.
I can't.  I have to know.	Please --
Oh, God#	What is it?
Where are we going?	Someplace safe.
Can't you see?  She just wanted her little girl back.	Who wanted her little girl back?
She's not alive, but she didn't die.	Oh, Jesus#
I'm sorry, John, but you have to run again.	What --
-- but he didn't.	Then who was he?
Think, John.  Why would they set you up?	Because I found out about her#
I'm so sorry# I just want him back# I want him back so bad#	I know# I do, too#
You don't remember me, do you?	We know each other?
I put you away --	Yes, you did.
It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.	I can't even stand up --
Huh, we don't seem to have her data.	Try again.
Which makes this the worst possible time to show that we're only human.	Uh-huh#
Look at the kid.  In this one, he's on the left of the man in the suit.	Yeah?  So?
Go ahead.	Did he close the front door?
Red Ball?	Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
Why did you catch that?	Because it was going to fall.
At least now you -- and I -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.	Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
She spoke to me.	To you?  I don't think so#  What'd she say?
Just go to the beginning!	Okay.  Fine.  Where the hell is that?
Detective.  Nice of you to come down here.  Seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now.  Jesus, what's up with your eye?	I need your help.
Stop --	Tell me how.
What happened?  Where's the rest?	I guess that's all of it.
I won!	What a big boy.  How old are you?
Who are you?	I'm your son.  I'm you.
Do you know who I am?	Some -- somebody's father?
You're not gonna kill me?	No.
You're supposed to kill me.  He said you would.	Who said I would?
Let go of the gun.	You're not gonna kill me#
Congratulations, sir.	My God#
Good God.  What was that?	Wait, just a second#
So there is a way to fool the system?	Yes.
Sir, the team's gonna be light without those men.	Yes, I know.
He looks familiar.	Who?
This your work?	Yes.
I like it.	Thanks.  You take anything in your coffee?
I don't have any sugar either.	Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
Since right after we lost our son.	You mean after he lost your son.
You know I need to use you.	To what?  Trap him?
Look, Bobby, I don't know what happened, and I don't want to know what happened, but something's up.	What are you talking about?
He'll be a minute, hon. You want some coffee?	No thank you.
Okay. We got a lot happening here. Here comes the good part# Okay#	Somebody's getting comfortable.
Is he cute?	He's okay.
What's wrong, baby?	He's not doing it.
I gotta go, baby. I love you. Tell mommy I called. You be a big girl and be careful when you're alone.	I love you. Come home.
Honey?	Where were you?
Go finish getting ready. I'll take care of dinner.	Yeah? You sure?
I never promised you anything.	How could you let her see this?
Take her.	What'd you say?
I -- I -- I# Don't#	I don't get it.
C'mon girl. Eat up.	Get away from her.
So what do we do?	We go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. We make the drop, go home to California.
Where we going?	Quick drop. In and out.
Yeah. Sure.	How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in.
Yes.	What is it?
There won't be a next thing.	Take a few days --
Hi. I, uh, think that's us.	Hi. I'm Jimmy.
I can wait around if you want.	No. That's cool, man.
Sorry, man, but#	Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.
We need guns.	We don't need guns.
It's ours.	To keep?
Holy shit. Can you believe this?	Pretty nice.
You hear that? You can drink as much as you want up here.	We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
Who you calling?	Shhh# Hello, room service?
What are you doing?	What are you doing?
So is this the drop?	Like I said, I don't know.
Yeah.	So we're working?
You happy?	About what?
Where do you think you're going?	Back in.
What the hell did you do?	I swear to God, I didn't do anything.
What are you doing.	I got a bad feeling, man. I don't want to go in naked.
Put that shit out#	C'mon, man#
Let's do it.	I'm your soldier.
We need guns.	We don't need guns.
Hey, boys.	Tom. How's it going?
C'mon#	Fuck#
Where's the surprise?	You want your surprise?
I want to leave right now.	I didn't do anything --
Yes?	Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
Yes?	Drinks are free, right?
Yes.	Where do you live?
I'm not saying shit to neither of you.	Why? What I say bad?
See you later.	You really in trouble?
No shit?	Does anyone want another?
What do you want?	A little Charlie, perhaps.
Here they are, then.	How's it going?
Last thing I want is you with a gun.	Word.
So whenever we want#	Yeah. Grab one of the cards behind you. Call that number. It's my cell.
I get it.	Tell me.
Yeah.	What?
I'll get it.	Who's up for a night on the town.
Where can I get a hold of you?	YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.
Don't never write nothing down. File it up here, like I do.  'Cause if they can't find no paper they ain't got no proof. Ya dig?	Yes, sir.
I told you less paper, less trouble.	I'm working on it.
Sometimes you got a big ugly mouth.	Yeah, and I'm putting my money where my ugly mouth is. I'm putting you back in the numbers right now.  Baby, what's today?
Daddy, where's my money?	What you talking?
Take it easy, baby.	That really you, Red?
That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. Ain't all these white man's books?	They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
Yeah. When I was picking a lock to rob somebody's house.	Tell Him that.
Do you?	Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
What?	She ate.
Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why?	If you want to tell me.
Could we sit down someplace?	I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
That's something I haven't done in fifteen years.	What?
Let's talk about you for a change.	There's nothing to talk about.
It won't be easy.	Just hold me.
Why are you looking at me like that?	Because you're in trouble.
Get some sleep.	You have to sleep for three.
I'm sorry. I haven't been the best husband or father.	Shhh!
Stop calling us. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. I'll kill you. I'll kill you.	Betty it's me. It's me.
I'm gonna try and get some work done tonight.	Let some of us come down there.
Did you see the papers today?	Yes, sir, I did.
Can I ask you something?	Sure, man.
I thought you said we were going to the movies last night.	I say a lot of things.
She know?	If she got eyes, she do.
I better not come in.	I ain't stupid.
Baby, I'll call you tomorrow.	What for? I ain't white and I don't put out.
It's the same questions, Mrs. Little. Since the death of your husband --	Murder.
Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you?	Please make way, please --
Another one?	How long has this been going on?
You the man.	You better believe it.
You evil this morning.	What's your story, baby?
Baby, I was gonna give it to you.	Well, bitch you move too slow.
Jesus, Red, she's just a kid.	Jesus ain't got nothin' to do with this.
Don't never try to cross someone who ain't afraid to die.	You the man!
You want to be the head man?	That's right.
Who the hell are they?	Brothers of Brother Johnson.
[Where are you coming from?]	[South America.]
A lot of people are looking for you.	I guess that makes you the smart one.
Maybe I can help your situation and you mine.	So where do we begin?
Where do I find you?	I'll call you tomorrow.
[We page him and he calls back on this cell phone.]	[What is his name?]
[Drive.]	[Do you know who I am?]

[Yeah.  Yes.]	[Listen! I will give you a life for a life.]
[I don't know him. I saw the opportunity and got lucky.]	[Lucky how?]
[That's all I know! Please. I'm sorry for the girl. But it was business! I'm a professional.]	[That's what everybody keeps saying.]
So what's wrong?	Nothing wrong.
Yeah, right#	Oh, like you haven't been in worse places.
What are you doing here?	I came to visit you.
No.	You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?
We're taking a different way home.	That's right.
And don't start crying.	I'm not crying.
You're fast.	Once I get in the water but not starting off. By the time I catch up, it's too late.
They'll be back in a week.	They can stay for two weeks. I don't care.
Do you always sleep with him?	I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.
Did you sleep alright?	Yes.
Doesn't matter. I always finish second.	You need to practice.
Remember you asked me what state I was from?	Yes.
You're late.	I'm sorry.
Where's my mother?	I dropped her at home.
Could I ask you a question?	Could I stop you?
You've done much of this work before?	Never.
Why are you here? Why didn't you die?	Because#  I was already dead.
[You have the money.]	[Yes.]
You should be sleeping, baby.	I'm trying, mom.
Good news. You're going back to school.	When?
I like him, Mom.	You do?
I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very sick.	Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby.
I think it's nice he's American.	I think it's fantastic.
She likes him.	Hmm?
It will be a hard break.	She's young. She'll get over it.
[You only fuck me to get information.]	[You only give information so you can fuck me.]
So what do you feel like doing tonight?	I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
All right, I'll see you!	Where you going?
Who you gonna call?	I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
Hey! What are you doing here?	I came to see you. How you feel?
Hey, I come home from your house last night, Marty was here with a girl.	Who?
You gotta real nice face, you know? It's really a nice face.	Thank you.
This is the kitchen.	Yes, I know.
No, Marty, please#	I like you. I like you. I been telling you all night, I like you#
No#	Please#
Okay, so I'll see you tomorrow night then.	Okay.
Oh, that's nice. So the doctor was wrong, wasn't he?	Oh, no! She died right in the hospital#
What time is it?	About eight o'clock.
Tommy, before you go, I wonder if you gimme a little advice.	Sure, what?
Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas?	Sure, great if you ain't married.
All right, Ma. I'll be back in about an hour, an hour anna half.	Sure.
I don't like her.	You don't like her. You only met her for two minutes.
Tommy#	I don't wanna hear anymore about it, you hear me?
Good. You've both been working close to the front.	Never this close.
Okay, I'm a witness, but how do you prove who's right?	There's only one way.
This kid's ready but we won't know all the damage till we get in and see what's happened. What have you got?	Nothing can't wait. Shall we check it out with the Major?
When will he be able to write?	What's he got to write, for God's sake?
Henry's got our orders! We're going home!	When?
Frank#	Don't stop now! Please#
Wait a second#	I can't# couldn't.
I was just asking#	Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
Very well, Your Majesty.  Congratulations, Frank. He picked you.	No, no, that one.
I don't feel anything.	Oh, Jesus.
I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.	I don't get it.
See you.	It's possible
Isn't this ridiculous, Doctor? Six months I've been here and there are still times when I can't stand it. I just go to pieces.	There's nothing ridiculous about it.  A kid like you#
You're asking for somebody else?	It happens to be a matter of life and death.
It was really nice of you to take me along.	I didn't have much choice.
He's coming to.	Let's get his clothes off quick.
What's going on? Who started this?	You mean who hit who?
Can you make out what they're talking about?	I can try, sir.
Morning, girls. Good morning Major.	Good morning.
Can you guys take one minute to look at a kid for me?	Now?
How is he?	Nice.
Er, would you, er, would you like to make some money?	Yeah, maybe.
Huh?	Are you all right?
Don't mind the Colonel. He hates people.	He likes you well enough to stick around.
Say, he's a friend of mine.	Never mind. Let him alone. He's all right. I'll be right over there pulling for you.
Can I help you pack?	No, thank you.
Do you care if I sit down out here?	No.
You know, I had a crazy dream last night. It was about you.	About me?
How many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, I mean?	I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
Did you write this?	Yes, I did, John. But I had no idea what was going on.
Go ahead, driver! Ball park!	John, please let me go with you! Please, John!
Better let me talk to him.	All right, but present it to him as a great cause for the common man.
Oh!	Go ahead, open it, open it.
Hello there. Well, well! If it isn't the man about town!	All set, Ann?
That's good.	No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
Say that again.	There is no letter. I made it up.
I can read. I can read!	Sorry.
That's our man. He's made to order.	I don't know. He don't seem like a guy that'd fall into line.
Hurry up, Pop.	Oh.
What's the idea?	No, no, no. Now that's too much!
Colonel!	You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.
No sense in going up there! I been here for hours. He ain't here!	Oh, let me go, will you!
I went up to Miss Mitchell's house, boss. Boy, she's in a bad way.	Where is she?
Hey, boss. Get a load of this.	What?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.	Both of 'em?
Hey, Boss.	Oh, quiet, quiet, quiet.  Say, tell me something did you read that speech you're gonna make tonight?
Well, I don't get it.	Huh? Get what?
Did you write that letter to Miss Mitchell?	No, I didn't.
How about family? Got any family?	No.
It's good to see you. Sit down.	Thanks.
It's for Ann . . .	Oh, how nice! Thank you very much.
Thanks. Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.	Good night, John.
Oh, yeah. That's what I mean. See? It was easy as all that, huh?	Uh-huh.
I know one way you can do it.	How?
Have you got the speech I gave you?	Yeah.
What happened? Is there a problem?	May I come in? I would just like to ask you a couple of questions.
Could I please have a little water?	Of course.
This has nothing to do with Walter.	They want Walter dead!
They have less power over you if you look into my eyes.	Huh?
Tell my dad.	Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
Where's the car?	I need to get something straight first.
Hold on a second here.	Is there a problem?
I want a plane waiting at the airport. I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there.	Is that all?
Open your shirt.	I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me.
How are we gonna get him out of there?	We could fill it with water.
Come on. Let's go for a drink.	I don't really like to drink.
You got a girlfriend?	Why? You like my ass?
Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.	You living together?
Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.	So what do I say to this guy?
They need to run first and second?	Yeah, first and second.
We won!	We lost.
How long you been coming here?	About six years. My partner took me.
What the fuck is going on.	I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
It might have happened no matter who was up there.	Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
How many have you lost?	I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
I know how you feel, Ray.	You don't know shit, and I suggest you leave.
You know what I think? I think you only want me now, because I'm with somebody else.	Who cares what you think. I want you back and that's all that matters.
Yeah. I'm sorry.	Can I come in?
Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.	What do you want from me?
I wanted to get this out of the way.	You got a bet on the game tonight?
It's already started.	I was going to catch the last half on TV.
You like this place?	It's very nice.
Yeah?	#Let me just show you.
Hmm?	Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
And a car.	Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
Are these yours?	Yeah, they are but#
There are two million people in there with you.	Yes.
It's okay.	Okay#
Why?	To live forever.
She said I have a son#	No, she said she had a son.  In a dream she once called life.
How come I can't remember?	Because I took it out of your memory.
Your life that bad?	No, not me, I've been lucky.  But I've seen what happens to other people --
You were right.	About what?
You don't have much sex up there in the real world, do you?	No#
It's all here#	Yes.
The guests are here.	Guests?
But this is impossible.	That's the grace of this world.  Nothing's impossible.
What's happening?	Nothing, go back to sleep.
It's time to wake up.	Wake up?!
But what would happen to me?  I have no body to return to.	Not my problem.
You were the one who was dying.	Yes#
You sure he's going to come?	It's his nature.
What?	The weather.
What's her name?	Who?
Take care.	Take care?  Where the hell are you going --
Won't be time if he gets access --	-- He won't.
He had access to the keys --	-- Yes.
One condition.	What?
What did he tell you?	The truth.
Then you had her killed.	Why would I do that?
Someone you have to get back to?	No.
Most nights you wake up crying. Never knowing why.	Who are you?!
That's why they told you you can't go inside.  They can't have you running into her.	Her?
Why?	It was a test.
To see how long it would take for me to realize.	Realize?
And it meant something.	Yes.
What?	Way you kiss me.
I wasn't with you.	I know.
I'm sorry.	Sorry?!
What's so funny?	This.  No point to it.
It was just there.	There?
We've got him locked!	Speed?
He's on us!!	Wait a second#  What time is it?
We've come all this way for a rock wall?!	There should be a way to open it.
Anybody see anything?	# Let's take a look over there.
You okay?	I think so.
I'm in!	LET'S FLY!
There goes the neighborhood.	A real shame.
I'm outta here.	Wait for me!
GET OFF ME!	BUT I'M YOUR COUSIN!
Taking over the world is one thing.  It's finding good help to run it for you that's the killer.	You want me to place a few calls?
Don't you ever have anything nice to say?!	Well, if I did I certainly wouldn't say it to you!
That was a CHEAP shot!	We couldn't have done it better ourselves.
THREE SECONDS!!	LET'S DO IT!?
Up here, Boss.	That ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
Maybe you better hear what I got to say first.	Whatever you say, Boss.
Are you frightened?	Why should I be?
I had everything. Once.	So what happened?
We could lose the deal!	If we have to.
You ain't even a man yet.	That ain't what your mama said.
Inside, they were talking of you.	I can just imagine.
You here with Bobby?	No. I'm here with you.
What's the matter?	I must be going.
Come on. It's Christmas. At least stay for breakfast.	I'm already late.
If I look weak now, it's over.	I'm very sorry# I didn't#
A lot of shit came out of me in the hospital. I'm sorry you got hit by it.	You must be feeling better, if you're looking for sex again.
Charlie?	I'm doin' business here!
We'll figure out something.	I'm supposed to be at my old man's for Christmas dinner at eight.
At first, it will hurt you. But you will come to understand and we will be strong together.	You're fuckin' crazy. You're all fuckin' crazy!
Sorry, Charlie. I gotta get my Johnson worked tonight.	Jesus.
Forget it.	Fuck 'em.
So we're gonna knock 'em both off?	If it comes to that. Yeah.
Everybody's talkin' about ya, Charlie. First time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived.	Guess I'm just lucky.
Yes?	I'm comin' for my twenty thousand.
You're fuckin' crazy.	But only on purpose, Tommy.
 I beg your pardon?	I didn't say anything.
Kid - didn't they tell you about this party?	Tell me what?
Land of Death. How do I get there?	Kid, listen: that's all I'm saying. And you didn't hear it from me.
Look at this! He won't let us leave!	Who?
Did we just - hit something?	I don't think so.
I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.	I'd better go report this#
Don't ask where I got it.	You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?	No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.
Where'd he go??	I don't know.
Oh, please, don't hurt me.	I just need to use the phone, lady.
Excuse me, sir.  I just wanted to thank you for helping me get into my building yesterday.	Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome.
Who told you we deal drugs?	I'm just concerned about my daughter.
Is there something else I can do for you?	Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
So, what do you think?	Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
I think you should consider coming out and staying with me longer.	Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything.
Where to?	Are you sure you got my bag in?
Yes, sir--big as life. Been there some time now.	Yes, sir.  All right, boys--let's go.
Tell me why!	Well, because you're doing all right at the minute.
Did you like the first act?	Yeah. What about the second act?
Why do I always laugh at that?	"There's more light here," he says--
Hey! We're gettin' married--!	Right now--everything I own--!
Yes, Joe, yes--right away. 	What is it?
Now--now--please--that's quite all right. Relax, boys--	This--this is a great honor, sir. I-- I--
I did. What about it?	Well, Jeff put that out himself.
Mr. President!	Mr. President!
I'm sorry! Gee! I hope--	That's all right, my boy--don't bother--
Well--goodnight.	Goodnight, Jeff.
Mr. President! A point of order!	Mr. President--
Please, sir!--come with me!	No, Jeff--please--!
What is it?	Office of--Senator Smith?
It might save some of the pieces, Jeff. It would leave a doubt about the whole thing--about you. Might blow over, this way.	Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
Ah! That's more like it! What?	Well--for a couple of years now--I-- I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State--
I wouldn't wait if I were you.	What do you mean? What's going on?
Joe--drop everything and come with me!	What's the matter?
Jeff--this is Mr. Taylor.	Glad to know you, Senator. Meet the boys--
Jim!	Just a minute, Joe!
Jim--the boy's talking to that State-- the story is out--!	Sure! The fight's in the open now-- to a finish--!
How nice.	All right, we'll take Jeff with us--
No. Don't ever want to go out without telling us.	Who are you?
That's going to be fun.	Some people like it.
We'd like to get in touch with him. It's very important.	Who's that?
Most every day.	Sometimes twice.
For no reason, I guess. He always does it. We always run into the house when we see him coming.	Never can tell what he's going to do.
Are you married?	Yes, sir.
No. Are you?	No.
I don't mind though. I had a lot of fun doing it.	Would you like to go for a walk?
Would you like to walk the rest of the way? It's so nice out.	Yes.
You know, you said something to me when you first met me that I've thought about a great deal.	What's that?
I've often thought about going back.	You have?
Couldn't sleep. Kinda wanted to talk to you. Do you mind?	No - not at all. I couldn't sleep either.
I didn't think you could come with the party and everything.	Oh, I wouldn't let them stop me from seeing you. So I threw them out!
Yes, if it isn't too late.	I'll get my hat.
The reason why I wanted to take a walk, Mary, is 'cause I wanted to talk to you.	Let's just walk, okay?
Mary, I'm going home.	Are you? When?
Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me.	No, I don't mind.
Would you like to read it? It's to you.	Yes, of course.
Hello, Mary?	Oh, hello darling.
What's the matter, hon?	Nothing.
What's up, Babe? Something's eating you.	No. It's nothing.
You're a fool, Babe.	I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
What'll I tell him if he calls up?	Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place.
Just a minute. No, you don't.	We're not going out tonight.
Why there she is!  Of course she's home.  Stupid of me . . .	Hello.
Now you're talking, Babe. I'll keep the whole front page open. What are you going to do?	Have lunch.
How'd you get the picture?	Had the boys follow us.
What're you going to do?	I'm going to tell him the truth.
Come on, come on!	Hurry up!
It don't look as though we're gonna get any pictures tonight.	Babe ought to get him drunk again.
You try it.	Me, sir?
How's it going? Okay?	Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir.
Sit over there, will you?	Me sir?
How is this, sir?	Perfect! Perfect!
You can't come up here!	Let me go! I wanna see him!
Thank heaven.	Better wire him right away, John.
He's what?	What was that you said he was?
That's pretty.	Are you sure this is the town he lives in?
I can't find him.	You can't?
Look!	What?
I'd like to ask you a few questions.	All right.
Come in, please. Come in. Can I get you a cup of tea?	No, thanks.
Have a drink?	No, thanks.
Huh? On, no. Nobody important.	Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
Who are they?	I don't know.
Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?	Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.	Thank you so much. Good night.
No, sir.	Excuse me. What did you say?
Yes, sir.	What's that?
What do you mean? I remember everything!  Hand me my pants - I wrote her phone number on a piece of paper.	You have no pants, sir.
You came home last night - without them.	I did what!
Yes, sir. I beg pardon, sir, but did you ever find what you were looking for, sir?	Looking for?
Hey, did you hear that?	What, sir?
Pack my things, Walter. I'm going home.	Yes, sir.
Shall I call the police, sir?	No!  What do you want!!
I know my time's up, but I've got to get this out while I've got hold of it --	Take your time.
Her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner. First time in a long time she's been willing.	A friend?
Better make yourself comfortable. We got a three hour drive here.	I'm fine.
What are you doing for lunch?	Right now?
I've run on. Forgive me. We're here to talk about you.	Are we?
What?	Stop now.
Where's your wife, Henry?	Go to hell.
What's that?	You are so mean.
What is it?	It's a thought I had.
Let me just say something here# I have no idea if this is going to help.	What exactly is it supposed to do?
Uh, sorry, I'm going to have to#  #I really appreciate what you're trying to# uh, I can't thank you enough for#	My pleasure.
#People who have come to you with the faith that you know what you're doing# and that you are who you say you are?	Yes, your honor.
Yeah# me you, too# I was at your house#	Oh?
I've seen you going by on your board, but I didn't realize -- you're so young# to be so#	What?
You're early# it's not ready. What happened?	My patient had to leave early.
How long you been in this town?	Oh, I don't know#
Do we run into the street? No, I didn't think so.  Nice car. How's that place?	It's a pretty piece of land.
But you know how to drive?	Sure.
What's wrong with her?	Is she a friend of yours?
What's happening here?	We're going for a walk.
It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister.	Mother# go away!
What'd you want?	There's something I think we need to talk about.
Finally, some common sense#	What do you mean?
Well, look who's here#	Good evening, Mrs. Cook.
Feel free to lie down. Most people do.	I'd better not, I'll fall right to sleep. I think it's too soon for me to be sleeping with you.
We'll take it slow. You'll never feel you can't handle it.	I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying.
Please# forgive me.	What?
Okay then# Are you positive your mother's a bitch?  Just kidding.	You've got a funny idea of funny.
You're doing great.	I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
Is that when you split up?	No, that'd be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end. We went on for another year or so.
When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out. I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down.	That's what I like.
I need to talk to you# Doctor. Can I come in?	Of course.
Hello?	Hello.
Mother#	What do you think I'm after, Mrs. Cook?
I guess you saw the show#?	Which show was that?
Oh.	I want to spend the rest of my life with you# but I'm not sure you feel the same way.
#but first, you have to tell me something#	Anything# just ask.
You got off easy.	Will you wait for me?
I don't think you know what you're talking about.	Uh-huh.
#What balls on this guy? What're we#  #going steady? Jesus.	No again?
Can I ask you a personal question?	Of course! That's exactly what I want.
I hope you don't think I want you to do this for free. Just because we're gonna play it like we're friends, doesn't mean I won't pay you like a doctor.	I understand.
This is great!	This is exactly what I wanted.
So, would you say we're out here# let me think how to put this# Is your problem really that you're# lonely?	Don't you like this?
What?	This --
I want to tell you something, Doc, but before I do, I need to ask you a question# Because, for me to tell you this thing -- well, I haven't told anybody about this. It's the biggest secret I've got.	Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
How's it coming?	You don't think I'm insane?
Who else knows?	Just you.
Damn! What is your name?	Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
I've told you a lot of private stuff.	I can tell you anything else.
Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife.	Holy shit!
At least you pulled yourself out#	Things got a lot worse.
Sorry#	Wow.
Doc!# It's not me, is it?	What?
Hmm. I guess that doesn't help# I see where you're going here. It's a mess.	Yep.
Now go find me a big stick.	In the desert? What for?
The girl saved my life, figured it was the least I could do, keep her out of trouble.	You always did have more balls than brains.
Let's make us even, shall we?	Even?
C'mon, friend.	Why do you like to fight so much?
Where's your new friend?	What friend? You're my only friend.
Yeah?	Oh yes, always.
She is like all the others. She will die in the desert.	No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.
The key!? She has the lost key!?	Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.
The sun turning black.	Water turning to blood.
And what is he in prison for?	I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
No women allowed.	I am an English woman.
I will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life.	I would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.
You lie.	I would never!
A bright good morning to all.	What are you doing here?
Yeah, I was there.	You swear?
Yes.	Really want to know?
Did I miss something? Are we going into battle?	The last time I was at that place everybody I was with died.
We're almost there.	Are you sure?
That "thing" gets me excited.	The things that get you excited.
A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.	Who was talking about what?
No# Why?# Should I?	Gee, yeah, you told me it was the best time you ever had.
No we are not. We woke him up, and we must try and stop him.	We?! What we?! You didn't read that book. I told you not to play around with that thing.
He's here! I saw him! That thing is here!	The creature!? Are you sure!?
You called me your girl?	What?# Oh yeah, that was just um, you know, figure a speech.
Got it!	Got what?
Have you no respect for the dead?	Right now, I only wish to join them.
What do you suppose killed him?	Did you ever see him eat?
I can't believe I allowed the two of you to get me drunk.	Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
Hey,# don't I know you?	Um, well, you see#
Where's my gun?	What are you going to do? Shoot him?
Believe it, sister. That's what brought our buddy back to life.	And now he's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back
What?	What?
He was the last time I saw him.	When was that?
Come on, baby!	Do it, big boy!
But she's your mother. You gotta tell her.	I can't.
Sounds good to me.	Let's do it.
Hey# Can I buy you a beer?	I thought you'd never ask.
That's two more than the Fantastic Four.	Half a Dirty Dozen!
Hey# you okay?	Sure.
He'll never make it.	Think positive.
What did you do with Captain Amazing?	Captain who?
Come here.	I'm not that kind of girl.
Stay away!	Or you'll what? CAN ME?
Doesn't it piss you off the way the when you really want to talk to somebody you can't think of anything to say!	I guess# Are you always so angry?
Or talk?	Not tonight. 
Hi.	Alone tonight?
I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but#	What have they got that we ain't got?
Come on, guys -- we're fighting against evil.	Good or evil, what's the difference?
Oh don't start that again --	LOOK!
Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours.	We had an off night, that's all.
And it would be the right thing to do.	Yeah yeah -- and that, too.
There's a big difference.	I used to believe that. Now I'm not so sure.
You know something? Those guys are really starting TO PISS ME OFF!	But there's still only six of us.
So what else has Superman got?	He's got the fact that he's Superman!
GET MAD!	But I just don't feel it.
But she still might call!	Are you coming or not?
Cover me!	With what?
He doesn't miss a trick, does he?	What a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!
I saw him go in -- and he didn't come out!	But we don't know for sure it's the same guy.
Let's go.	Wait!# Look!
Maybe she's right.	Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for!
What's that?	Come on.
But# only when no one is looking.	Yes.
Are you famous?	Not yet.
Jeffrey!	Oh hi, Mom.
She likes you.	Definitely.
This is bad.	Who are they?
We may be getting in over our heads here.	This looks like a job for Superman --
And a social life.	Yeah, but how do we get to them?
To us!	Whatever our name is.
Are you sure he's still lives here?	Are you sure he's still alive?
Maybe it's time we checked that place out.	But how do we get in?
That was too close.	But we gotta find out what's going on in there.
It's time.	With or without him, we gotta go!
Where am I going?	Through there!
Yes -- who spoke up?	I did, sir.
Was the trip normal in every respect?	Yes, sir.
I haven't been there for three years.	I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
My God#!  What time is it?	Four o'clock.
And you, are you in love with any one else?	No.
Promise me you will never leave me.	I cannot promise you that.
Yes -- what is it?	Open the door.  It's me.
Who is it?	It's me.
I believe you sent for me.	Yes, yes, please sit down.  I will be with you in a moment.
Yes# but, first, can I say something to you, as a friend?	Certainly.
You could hear them?	Yes.
You mean you heard them making love?	Yes.
Do you like music?	Yes, I do -- very much.
Okay, I know what I want this time.	Anything you need.
Who are you?	I'm his cousin.
No I'm not.	I'll do it.
What you mean talk to her?	You know what he mean, dude.
For sure.  That's how I like 'em.	Not me.
It's about to work, just come on.	What about the dog?
This you?	Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.
Man, this a cool house.	Thanks, I just wish my mother had a chance to see it.
Just a little.	I can't taste nothing.
Who is that?	That's the sister.
So.	What you mean, so?
I walked.	You walked?
You know what this is?	Yeah, that's why I walked down here.
How can they do this?	I don't know.  Did ya'll forget to pay it or something?
I ain't trying to get in it.	You already in.
Blow.	That ain't gonna work.
It works.	Still gonna smell it.
What we gonna do?	I don't know yet.
You see that?	I didn't see nothing.
You go first.	Naw, you go first.
I hope to God that dog is happy.	Me too.
Wait.	Wait for what?
You want us to give you a ride?	I don't know.
Hello, remember me?	Hell yeah, I remember you.
Most definitely.	Better sooner than later.
Huh?	What are you doing here?
You did all this for me?	Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.
I did.  Is that door locked?	It's locked.
Next time, page me first.	Okay.
You alright?	Yeah, I'm cool.  See you later.
Here I come!	Well bring yo' ass on#
Nice neighborhood, huh?	It's alright.
You see that?	I saw it.
What is it?	Don't worry about it, man.  Get the phone.
That the big one, huh?	You damn right that's the big one.
What was that?	You don't wanna know.
You wanna knock?	Go for it.
Hey.	Ya'll live around here?
What?!  What that mean?	I don't know.
Hey, guys, I'm outta here.	Thanks for the help.
Ah damn.  Damn.	I got fired too.
What the fuck you looking at?	Nothing.
Just do it.	I don't know the number.
Hey, how you get out of here.	I don't know.
I thought you were taking me to see Mama?	I'll take you later.
Hey, what's going on?	Nothing.  What you want?
Need to lose some weight.	Shut yo' ass up.
My back.	What's the matter?
Don't remind me.	What happened here?
All right, I'll do it.	That's my girl.
Somebody close?	What?
Look#I've# I've got a problem. A big problem#	Oh, yeah?
You were saying?  Your daughter#.?	I#
How do you know that?	I saw her die. She was shot. With this gun.
You shot her?	No.
This? I've never even fired one.	Indeed.
Can we go now?	Of course. I'll get a car to drive you.
Good luck.	Same to you.
Come with us, sir.	I'd like to know what#
Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl!	Don't worry. She's good with kids.
Yes, yes, I understand.	Good.
You're out of your mind.	What's your point?
You get another chance in ten minutes.	Then I have time for a drink.
What would you do in my place?	Me?
What#?	Tell me why I miss him.
You killed him.	That's right, I killed him. He fucked up one too many times so I put a bullet in his eye. Then I put two more into him just to make sure. Now that was somebody I loved.
I killed you.	You fucked up.
Come back.	How do I know you won't kill my daughter once I'm gone?
Again.	No, please#
Yes, you're right, I don't understand.	Look#my daughter # she's going to die#unless you can help me.
All right, let's just#let's get security in on this.	No! You can't! They're in on it.
I don't know.	You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me.
Are you sure?	I've heard this speech a lot. Come on. We'll take care of him.  We will.
I think you better put that away.	I think you're right.
Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss like that?	On TV.
So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?	No way.
He has to say "over and out". Daddy, you have to say "over and out".	Over and out.
Can we go now?	Not just yet, baby. There's#there's something Daddy has to do.
No, honey, not to be a hero. But I want you to remember something for me, all right?	All right.
Will you promise me that?	I promise.
Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?	I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
Keep the change.	Don't think I won't.
You said there was only one person you knew wasn't in on this thing.	Yeah.
Well?	I don't know.
What are you going to do!?	This is about power and you haven't got any. There's nothing more you can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying.
Hey!	I think this is worth a dollar.
Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it?	It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that?	Everybody does?
That's pretty good.	I've done much better ones than this.
I'm not a baby.	You're a big girl, huh?
Close your eyes.	Why?
You got this under control?	Yeah.
It's under control.	It better be.
Where is he? Did you lose him?	Shut up.
That one.	Nah.  Hates his wife.
I'm looking for them.	Where?
And what happens if I don't call you?	I kill her anyway.
You talk to a cop, you even look at a cop too long and your daughter is dead.  Do it.	Go ahead, sugar Die.
Yeah.	Do it!
Come Back.	Yeah.
Any trouble?	No.
He never told about the money.	No.
Ben, I'm a Man of God.	Tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
And the Lord told that man --	Yes! Yes!
Is he hit pretty bad?	All to pieces!
What can we do, Mother?	I thought if you went and talked to him -- another man --
I'm hungry, John.	We'll steal somethin' to eat.
John, where's your folks?	Dead.
Did you hear what I said, son?	Huh?
Tell me what, boy?	Nothin'!
She thinks that money's in the river, but you and me, we know better, don't we, boy?	I don't know nothin'!
All right#  Come along.	What?
Now: Where?	Under the stone in the floor.
Nothin'. 	Come to me, boy!
Sure, that's no secret.	What's your name?
Yes; John's bad.	Tell me another secret about my Dad.
O no! Your turn!	All right.
What's wrong, John?	Didn't you hear me, boy?
What do you want?	Them kids!
How long's this been going on?	Since the murder. She was fine before that.
Okay, good. She's asleep.	Thank God.
Okay?	Okay, okay.  I think.
Jesus, it's dark in here.	Shhh. Now listen, here's what we're gonna do#
Yeah. So?	Just checking -- keep out of sight!
Whenever I get nervous I eat.	And if you can't do that, you sleep.
Hello?	Hi.
Bring him out of what?	My dream.
How you doing, pal?	Okay. Hi, dad.
You used me, daddy!	What the hell you doing going to school today, anyway -- your mother told me you didn't even sleep last night!
-- I want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now -- can you do that?	Sure, but#
Sure, okay, I'll be there. Now you just turn in and get some rest, sweetheart. Please. Deal?	Deal.
Tell her I'm not here, tell her#	Uh, she just saw you, sir#
Had to've done it. No one else was in there.	How you know that?
Where you think you're going?	School.
Did you sleep?	I'll sleep in study hall, promise. I'd rather keep busy, you know?
Right home after.	Right home after. See you.
You okay?	Great
Take this, it'll help you sleep.	Right.
You okay?	Yeah. Just had a little dream. I'm falling right back to sleep.
Give me the key, mother.	I don't even have it on me, so forget it.
We got her mother's bed. You two got the rest.	We should get her out of here#
Your old man thinks I did it, don't he?	He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
Someone else was there.	The door was locked from your side.
No.	Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
Do you think I did it?	No.
I can't believe his mother let him come over here.	Right. Well, she didn't, exactly#
What the hell you doing here?	Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
From Leon.	From Leon!# How is he?# Come, tell us# open it# tell us# how is he?
No, I left everything in Paris. I just happened to be wearing this.	Tell me# what else did you have?
You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.	That's right# and we might as well face it.
Is there anything I can do for you, monsieur?	No, no.
Which lawyer?	You didn't get legal advice?
Now let's forget everything except that we're together.	That's right.
Guest?	We have opened a restaurant#
Your breakfast, monsieur.	I don't feel like any breakfast.
Yes, Leon#	What is it, my boy?
Leon, my little boy.	Oh, Leon, you are so good.
This is a fine thing. Maybe we've missed him already.	How can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like?
They tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor.	While you eat, you look at the view.
Well, gentlemen# how about a little lunch?	Get out of here!
You found your way to us and we weren't easy to reach, were we?	No, no.
Well, it means another two weeks in Paris.	Too bad we have to waste all that time.
Yes, monsieur?	Just looking around.
If there is anything we can do for you#	No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?
You, please.	Me?
Can I help you?	You might hold this for me.
Do you hear that?	It's twelve o'clock.
Just an old man. His memory is getting weak.	What are you after?
I suppose you don't think that's funny?	No.
Not funny, huh?	No.
I'll tell you that joke again. A man comes into a restaurant. Did you get that?	Yes.
It's nine o'clock.	That's when one half of Paris says to the other half, "What are your plans for this evening, madame?"
Quickly, please# tell me one of your funny stories.	A funny story?
Don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart.	No. Nobody will find us.
Are we going to build our little house?	Yes# a little white house.
What shall we get? The news!	No, no news. We don't want to know what's happening in the world. We want to be left alone, don't we?
No music.	No, no music.
They wouldn't let me in so I had to get you out.	So -- you're behind all this. I should have known.
Leon! What in heaven's name#!	Huh?
Thank you.	Is this your new dress suit?
Hello, Leon darling!	Hello.
Good morning.	What?
Here, please#	What do you want?
Cigarette?	Thank you.
This way, madame. Are you alone? By the window perhaps?  Or a nice little corner table?	This will do. 
Bring me something simple. I never think about food.	But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about?
I am sorry# I have to leave.	Thank you so much, my friend. I will get in touch with you.
We could check the tape again, sir.	You don't need to check the tape.  I know what I said.
Mitchell?  Mitchell's # family.	Either it goes to Mitchell or it comes here.
How much do you need?	Uh, I would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years #
I was sorry to hear about your wife.	Yes # I got the money.
Who's gonna tell Mitchell?	You do it.
It's a code or something.	I figured that out.
I like it.  I like the idea.	Is it legal?  I mean has anyone ever done it before?
Sorry #	# go on.
Gentlemen, I think it's about time for us to be getting to the airport.	Let him finish, Bob.
More light, chief?	No #
Richard # come with me, would you #	Why me?
We haven't said grace yet.  Richard.	Is it my turn?
It's a gift, Richard.  This law school is a gift from your brother.	Did he have to die for me to get it?!
What'd he say?	What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.
Hey # you'll be able to do it now.	What # ?
Relax, Dick, it's just me # The desert's so beautiful, isn't it?  I want to go home, Dick.  Time to go home.	You're not gonna quit on me, are you, Harold?
Where'd you find him?	Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.
Like you said Jack, I'm just a New York lawyer now.	We'll see about that.
Fuck it!  He doesn't like me, John!  It's your fault, Henry.	I beg your pardon --
I was asleep, Mr. President.  What can I get you?	Just # uh # you know.
But it was all we had.	# but it was all we had.
# Somebody should shoot the little bastard.	I wanna fight just as dirty as he does.
Hi.	Hello #
# but it depends on what I'm doing to the music, Dick #	Uh, is your mother # still alive?
Mr. President, the press guys asked if you could come back for a minute.	The hell with 'em.
We lost #	I know #
What are you saying?  What are you talking about?	I want a divorce.
This is just what they want, Buddy. Don't you see it?  They want to drive us apart.  To beat us.  We can't let them do it.  We've been through too much together, Buddy # We belong together.	That's what you said the first time we met.  You didn't even know me.
Dick, don't#	Buddy, look at me # just look at me. Do you really want me to quit?
We can be happy.  We really can.  We love you, Dick.  The girls and I#	If I stop # there'll be no more talk of divorce?
I'll do it.  No more.	Are you serious?
Dick, you should call Bobby.	He doesn't want me at the funeral.
It was our dream, too, Buddy, together # always.	Do you really want this, Dick?
Yes # you know it!  Yes # I will. Yeah!	Then I'll be there for you.
Hi, Buddy.  What are you doing in here?	I've missed you.
Congratulations, Dick.	How am I going to break this to Bob Hope?
Yes.	When?
Why didn't you?	You can't expect me to explain that to you.
It'll be over soon.	No # it's just going to start now #  If I could just # If I could just # sleep.
But being out of the game gives me time to write.	To what?
How'd you know I was here.	Who else'd be in your truck.
#I always thought when I got older God would sort of come into my life in some way. He didn't. I don't blame him. If I was him I'd have the same opinion about me that he does.	You don't know what he thinks.
#What you got ain't nothin' new. This country is hard on people. Hard and crazy. Got the devil in it yet folks never seem to hold it to account.	Most don't.
#I don't know what I do feel like.	Try "old" on for size.
Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is.	You ain't heard from him?
We goin' in?	Gun out and up.
Probably must be.	So when was he here?
What was the bullet?	Wasn't no bullet.
#Be careful.	I always am.
#How'd you sleep?	I don't know. Had dreams.
It ain't even three years we been married.	Three years ago I said them very words. No and Good.
No.	I ain't got the money.
#You got no cause to hurt me.	No. But I gave my word.
Did you buy that gun?	No. I found it.
Do you have any idea how goddamn crazy you are?	You mean the nature of this conversation?
Where does he work?	Did you not hear me? We can't give out no information.
What's this about?	Step out of the car please, sir.
Huh? What is#	I need you to step out of the car, sir.
Yeah, that'll suck some power. Over time.	You from around here?
Who is this.	You know who it is.
#You need to talk to me.	I don't need to talk to you.
#I know where you are.	Yeah? Where am I?
You know how this is going to turn out, don't you?	No. Do you?
#Me?	Yes.
#Will there be somethin' else?	I don't know. Will there?
Is somethin' wrong?	With what?
Will there be anything else?	You already asked me that.
You don't know what you're talking about, do you?	Sir?
#What time do you go to bed.	Sir?
Well# I need to close now --	You live in that house behind the store?
Call it.	Call it?
Look# I got to know what I stand to win.	Everything.
#Don't put it in your pocket.	Sir?
Good. I need everything else.	Okay.
#I'm wondering#	Yes?
#Don't worry. I'm not the man that's after you.	I know, I've seen him. Sort of.
Hey, Sheriff. How's everything?	Oh, you know, the usual# keeping the world safe.
Sheriff, I don't#	C'mon, Betty, open up! I got some questions for you about#
Jesus#	You think a woman did that?!
What the hell do you want?# Hey, Sue Ann, what's up?	We think we know where Betty is.
Need something else?	No, I was just# How you doing?
Do you know who I am?	#I# I know what you are.
That's my son! My son is dead!	I'm sorry.
If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance#	I better go check on them.
It's all right.	You sure? Maybe next week we could#
Let me know if you need anything, okay?	Are you and Larry happy?
#of course you do.  You don't remember me?	I take it I should. I'm sorry.
Why do they keep calling you George?	I don't know. Why do you keep calling me George?
I haven't been this happy since I was twelve years old.	What happened when you were twelve?
I've never met anyone like you, Betty.	I know, that's why we were meant to be together#
Why are you doing this to me?	Why am I doing this to you? Isn't this what you wanted?
Oh. Of course# sorry.	My treat. You were saying# something about how stupid you've been?
I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and --	What's so special about it?
Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd you come here for?	I came for love#
I left my husband two days ago.	Really?
Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've ever done, but I've gotta do it.	You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you#
No# I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.	Man, that is love.
You can go get your stuff right now. I'll walk you down.	No, that's not, I couldn't#
I got this apartment with a guy.	The one you were telling me about?
Guess who I saw today.	Who?
Either you're making a fool out of me because you get off on it, or you got serious problems. Which one is it?!	I have no idea what you're talking about.
So what do you say? Can we be friends?	#okay.
Looking for someone?	You never know who you'll see.
Were you with him this whole time?	Oh, God! You scared me! Yes#
Does he know you think he's real?	He is real.
This isn't fair, you know. Do you always get what you want?	No, almost never.
What are you doing?	I'm going back to# I need to# I don't know.
What?! That you had something to do with it?	I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't#
If you ate at the Tip Top you did.	Oh, yes, with the coffee#
All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.	If we're for real?
Oh, Jesus, please# Please, God.	#and put them in your mouth.
It's not here. Let's go.	You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.	Should I kill him now?
They said find it. Find her, find it. Finish the job you were paid to do.	Half.
You don't look comfortable here. That's 'cause you don't like being the center of attention, do you? Nah. You're like me.	What the hell's the matter with you?
We should go.	We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
Well, guess what? I found Betty# where she's been, anyway.	Where? Where is she?
Who's this?	A doctor on the show# why?
#and how long did she work here?	Oh, five years, give or take.
Really?	You better believe it.
Jesus Christ!	He's waiting#
Betty, I thought this would be the best way. You know, throw you into it#	What the hell's going on?
Is there a problem, George?	No! No problem, there is no#  What is the problem? Just do that# thing# you do! Come on! You drove me nuts with this for three days, now do it!
All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!	No! Let me try this!
You've got to be missing a piece of your soul to kill someone. That's not our Betty#	#why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
SHUT UP! Shut the fuck up, both of you, before I kill you!	I'm the one who watched the show# I was#
You lie, motherfucker#	I swear to God!
I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.	Good Lord, what do we do?
Pete have a brother?	Not that I'm aware.
It's Tommy! They got Tommy!	Oh my God!
Well, I'm sorry honey -	Well, we need that ring.
A million dollars.	Million point two.
Me? Oh, I didn't have no plan. Still don't, really.	Well that hardly sounds like you#
Fact of the matter - there never was!	But# but#
Daddy!	He ain't our daddy!
Come back here, kid!	What for?
That's not how she told it. She said you wrote her every week you were away.	I wrote. Not every week#
I knew you'd make it!  Where's your girl? Didn't she come?	Naw. That's over with.
Joe!	Come over here where I can see you.
You're good.	Get on your feet and find out how good, sir.
What did you call me?	Pardon?
Now when I say "understand" I want the whole group to say, "Yes, sir!" Understand?	Yes, sir!
Daddy, I don't want to get into anything with you tonight. I'm tired and I#	What are you tired from?
Something tells me you've been here before.	Now what on earth would give you an idea like that?
Come on, guys. It's five o'clock.	One more minute.
That was you guys, huh?	Come on. Let's go dance.
Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?	Great.
You serious about having him over?	I haven't made up my mind.
You got a girl?	No, and I'm not looking for one either.
I hear most of the girls who come to these things are looking for a husband.	Not me.
I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.	He didn't give you much choice.
I forgot to thank you for breakfast.	Any time, sailor.
That was great.	It sure was.
I'm sorry. I can't sit with you.	I understand. Maybe we'll see each other after the show#
Hey, what about Sunday dinner? When're you gonna let me know?	When I'm good and ready.
Hi.	Are those for me?
I'm looking for Sid.	So?
I'd like to come with you.	Why?
Hey, do you guys ever# feel like you don't belong here#?	Yeah. All week long.
You okay?	Sure.
Hey, you guys still awake?	Yeah.
That isn't true, is it?	A little.
Talk to me in the morning. I feel like shit.	But it can't wait.
What?	A woman and a little girl, both asleep upstairs.
You're fuckin' A we can do this.	Not with me.  Not with people.
You're welcome.	Peace out.
What if she called the cops?	She didn't.
What the fuck is funny about this?	God.
He said open it.	Just sending a message.  She'll get the point.
You should see the look on your face.	The fuck did you do that for?!
Me.  I am.	That's right.
What?  What do you want me to do?	What do you think?  Get us into that room.
Are you okay?	Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a little more, and your mom'll give it to you.  You can wait a half hour, can't you?	Yeah.  She can.  She's fine, she's just like, tired, she's gotta rest. You rest, Kid.  Half an hour.
She's fuckin' crazy, she killed the kid!  She just killed her own kid!	It's not her fault, it's not her fault, the guy must have called them.  Look, look, look, she's telling us.
She's gonna handle it.	She better.
That's your problem.	That's their problem.
Let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here.	You finish.  Then we finish.
Bullshit.	You know how this gotta end.
YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!	FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!
Fuck.	I know.
Fuck!	Keep your voice down.
I mean, right?  Isn't it?	You're an idiot.
Unless Daddy comes back later.	Daddy's not coming back, she's in the middle of a divorce, it's just the two of them.  We're okay, here.  We can do this, right?
They won't get hurt.	What about us?  What if she has a gun?
Got her right where you want her, Junior.	Shut up.
Open it.	I did.
Be quiet.	We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
Cell phone.	Shit!
She's never coming out.	Hey.
You walk out that door and you lose your share of the money.	Yeah, whatever.
Yeah?	Everything okay?
'Bout four o'clock.	I don't get it.
Somebody called you?	Can we come in?
Can we come in?	Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?
Your husband says you said "There are three#" right before you got cut off.	Oh, that phone call#
Wait a minute, wait a minute.  We can still handle this.  Can we still handle this?	It's just the woman and the kid?
Cut it back a little bit.	No fucking way.
We're leaving.	The hell we are.
Suit yourself.	Nobody leaves.
Something's weird.	What?
Makes me nervous.	Why?
Fuck him.	Don't.
What's going on?!	People.  In the house.
He's going down.	That room!
Damn it!	It doesn't work?!
Can't hear a thing.	What do they want?
What do we do?	Wait.
"What we want is in that room."	They're coming in here, aren't they?
We're not coming out.  We're not letting you in.  Get out of my house. 	Say fuck.
Oh, please.	Give me a break.
Small space?	Don't though. 
Why did the chicken cross the road?	What am I, a five year old?
What, what, what is it?!	On the floor!  Get on the floor!
Got him!	Come on, come on#
We're never getting out of here.	Shhh#
Do it.	Yeah, but where's the third guy?
If it looks like I can't get back, just close the door.	No.
What are you doing?	I saw something, I saw#
Call Dad!	On it!
He'll do something.	Uh uh.
I'm sorry.	I'm sorry.
You're Judge right? We need to talk.	I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
So# we understand each other Judge?	Yeah.
Get out of the car.	What's with you?
Hey# what the hell you doing?	Shut up. Just shut the fuck up.
Check it out# Great huh? I tell you those guys know what time it is. Man I'm with that#	I don't know. Look around man.
#Glad you came man.	Yeah, only I figure you'd be the one doing the speaking.
I don't think that will be any problem#	You talk as if this thing's already been decided.
We appreciate your help with this.	So what's the deal?
Welcome brother, have you decided to get down with us?	I'm down.
What it be Judge. Nobody got hurt, Sister Betty's safe. This was a good day#	They were empty#
I saw# but#	But nothing# you do live here don't you?
Yeah, I do.	Well, act like it. Come on.
Huh?	He had a feeling you'd be coming by.
What's up with you?	Nothing.
We'll all get out of here together.	Later for that. I'm done either way#
Rose, what the hell you doing here?	Just come for the food, man. Ain't quite sure what their bag is but#
You meet those friends of yours in jail too?	Yes# No# Mom it's not like you think. They're alright. There out there trying to do something.
When?	Late summer.
Am I one of that sort?	You're the worst of that sort. You're the sort that gives that sort a bad name.
You don't know him very well, do you?	He's my father.
How did this# how did I let this happen?	You couldn't have known.
Excuse me?	I said, I'm not my sister.
Father#	It's already over.
Father, there's something else I need to talk to you about.	What?
It was a different time, son.  And you're a better man than that.	I see, do as I say, not as I do.
He wanted to, Susan, but he couldn't leave his men.	He left us.
There are some letters here from him.  Some are just to you.	I don't care.  I hate him.
His wife was killed yesterday.  She was with child.	I'm sorry, I didn't know.
Don't touch him.	How many men have we seen die?
How far away?	Four, five miles.
Thank you.	For what?
How many came back?	About a hundred and twenty.  Less than a third.
I was sorry to hear about your son.	I lost another a year ago, Thomas. He was only fifteen.
Not yet, Thomas.	When?
Put those away.	But father, they might come this way.
Father, you can't let them take him#	Quiet.
Father# I killed those men#	Don't blame yourself, you did what I told you to do.
What if you can't read what's written on there anymore?	Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
They do it to honor the dead, Ellen.	Is that right, dad?
Please hurry.	I will. Come and kiss me.
I want to look around, daddy-- may I?	For a little while.
Is he really all right?	Yes.
I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that.	You believe in it.
I don't get it.	Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
I'm not tired!	I'm sure you're not.
Do you swear?	I swear.
You need a glass?	Not at all.
You folks ready to go on?	Sure.
Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?	Yes.
What do you mean?	The place we're going is on the other side of that.
There's a lot of funny things down this way, Louis.	You're telling me.
It's funny, all right.	Just don't stop, Louis. You don't ever want to stop down here in Little God.  And you don't ever want to look behind you, whatever you hear.
Almost there, Louis.	You keep saying that.
Doesn't look like they last long.	Don't worry about that.
Can I have another one?	I guess it wouldn't hurt.
Well, she was a little upset at first, and that's why I thought you ought to hold your peace when you talked to your people last night#you did, didn't you, Louis?	Yes.
Let her go. It's cool.	Louis, the house is beautiful.
You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you?	Well, I've got a million questions about the area, and---
My God!	It's beautiful!
That's enough of that kind of talk!	I just said--
Getting there.	I got eggs down here!
I'm going to try to do better.	You're doing fine.
You better get going, hon.	Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
What's in your head, boy?	She.  Goes.  Free.
No, I really think I do.	All right then.
Now?	Now.  No, don't kill him.
Agreed.  You have my word, as a gentleman of fortune --	Will -- you can't trust him.
You?!	Me!
Come on!	No.  This won't work.  I'll stay behind, and fight them. You go on.
What?  What's wrong?  How will this help us get off the island?	It won't.  It won't, and so we won't.
Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?	That he is.
What's your name?	Smith.
Who makes all these?	I do.  And I practice with them. At least three hours a day.
Move away.	No.
I can get you out of here.	How?  The key's run off.
Agreed.	Agreed!
Shut up, before you lose them all!	These are the only ones worth having.  And we're going to need them --
What's that?	Depends.
No.	I'll lead them away.
Do you have any idea where you're going?	Jack!
Are you certain this is the right way?	It's the right way.
I think he's telling the truth.	He's not telling the truth.
He's still breathing.	Where did he come from?
Has my daughter given you an answer yet?	No.  She hasn't.
How long do you leave him in there?	Until he's done.
You can't mean that.	Come with me, Susan.  I want to show you something.
What are you going to do to him?	Do?  Well, I suppose that depends on you.
I should kill you right now for what you did to me!	Maybe you should, but you can't.
Did you feel that?	Did I?  I've been waiting for that for years.
Hey!	You don't want this.
I bet he hasn't read a single report we've written on the waste problem.	I hope you're right.  I'd feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didn't care.
Sir, please try to hold still.	So, I guess it worked.
Daniel#	What?  No kiss?  Not even for old times sake?
When did you#?	Been out for six months now.
Somebody has to.	Same old Daniel.
Yeah.	Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.
Susan!	What?  What's wrong?
Look at this!	What about it!
What's that supposed to mean?	Just giving credit where credit is due.
Just like old times.	Yeah.  Old times.
I want you to know that I really appreciate you helping me.	I'm glad you came to me for help.
That's pretty good.	Getting used to it.
I don't believe it.  You're here! Oh thank God.	You didn't think I could just leave you?
Run, Daniel!  Get out of here!	I'm not leaving without you, Susan!
You saved my life.	Did you think I could just leave you#?
Things do change.	I guess they do.
What?  I'm not going anywhere!	Oh yes you are!
All the different ways that I could kill you.	Oh yeah?
Indeed? How interesting.	Yes - isn't it.
Don't mind Mother.	I don't mind her if you don't.
May I use your telephone?	Certainly. Right over there.
Oh, I don't need another guess. It's quite obvious.	So, it's obvious, huh?
Will - uh - five thousand be enough?	For what?
I'm not going!	What are you talking about?
That's an excellent idea.	Oh, hello Mother!
Fine. Have a seat.	Thanks, I will.
This way.	Oh, man!
Thank you very much.	All right, all right, don't mention it.
Impossible. Put it on again.	Hey, make up your mind, will you?
How's that?	Not bad - not good - but not bad. You ought to be able to fool about almost anybody.
Look, I quit!	Yeah?
Did you take anything out of those pants?	Oh no, sir!
Say, you are nice. You're all right. You'd make a good wife.	Thank you, sir.
All right, outside!	I beg your pardon, sir?
I think I understand, sir. You mean you want me to go?	There you are. You caught on. You see, you're nice and you're smart too. You caught on right away. Outside! Go on! Outside! And don't come back!
That's a lovely dress.	Thank you.  Where is Mr. Smith?
Thanks, thanks.	I hope you'll be very happy.
Oh sure, we'll be happy. What's the matter with your eyes?	It's the smoke.
They all consider me just as one of the boys.	Right!
Come in, Joe. It's all right.	Hello, Joe.
Indeed? Perhaps he will do me a great favor.	With pleasure, Madame!
Shhh! Do you hear something?	Yes, sir.
Mary Sue?	Yeah?
Can I ask you a question?	Sure.
What?	It doesn't matter.
You sure you want to know this?	Yes.
Yes #  It's just that #	What?
It's okay. It's alright.	I can't go out there. How can I go out there?
Does it look okay?	Looks just like it did.
Wait.	What?
Thank you.	Sure.
I'm so proud of you, Bud.	Thanks # I love you.
Oh, hello Betty.	Hello Bill.
Oh, hi #	I'm sorry #
I just thought # It's beautiful.	Thanks.
Having kind of a tough time.	I think it looks nice.
Where'd you get this?	Bud brought it to me.
What?	She's crying.
Wait #	I've got to go #
It's alright. Let me see.	No #
What is that?	I don't know.
You can't go out there.	But I really should get home.
Sounds nice # Once you get used to it.	Yeah. It does.
I told you where I was.	All night?
Look. Let's just forget about it. Let's just go to the meeting and #	I told you, George. I'm not going.
Look at me George. That meeting's not for me. Look at my face.	It's fine. You'll put on some make up and #
It goes away # It'll go away.	I don't want it to go away.
Mary Sue--C'mon #	What are you doing?
Oh.  I can't.	Why not?
I'm busy.	With what?
Don't! Just let go.	It's better, Mary Sue.
What I mean is # Mary Sue's been a little "different" lately #	She won't go out with me?
Are you alright?  What is it?	Rain.
Did you do this?	Yes I did.
BUD--WHY DID YOU DO THIS?	Because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this.	Still doesn't make it right.
I think I've got something to say.	Very well #
YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!	Why am I out of order?
How'd you know about the fire?	What?
What are you doing?	What are you doing?
Lemme see that.	No way.
God, David. Just give it to me!	Get lost!
Oh my God.	What happened?
What did you do?	I don't know.
Oh God.	What's going to happen?
I don't believe this.	Neither do I.
I still don't see why we're doing this.	We're supposed to be in school.
What did you do to him?	Nothing.
You have no right to do this.	Well if I don't who will?
I had nothing to do with that fire.	It's okay.
Um # They like wanna ask you a question # I didn't know how to handle it. So #	Sure.
What's wrong?	Nothing.
So what is it?	Well # I just #  Can I ask you a question?
Can I ask you a question?	Yes.
Are you sure?	I told you. I'm like positive.
Hi.	Oh # Hi.
Um # You gotta turn off Main Street.	Oh # Right.
So what's it like?	What?
Do they have an Ocean? I've heard about the ocean.	Yeah.
What's going on?	Rain.
What do we do?	We'll just put up the top.
Can I open it?	Sure #
Where are they?	I'm not sure.
You're gonna forget about me.	No I won't. I swear.
I like calling you David.	I like it too.
# Her father.	Right. And how did she dress him?
Yeah #	What department store did they go to?
How much does it cost?	Oh--couldn't charge you for something like that. It's free.
Why would I do that?	Because we don't belong!
Look--we appreciate it. We really do. We just--we want to go home now.	But you don't know how long I've been looking for someone like you.
Hello there.	# Hi.
I want a word with you #	Oh--well #
OKAY. NOW YOU'RE REALLY STARTING TO PISS ME OFF!	I didn't do anything wrong.
How long do you think you've been here?	I don't know # Three, four weeks.
Bud?	Sorry # I had to help my folks and then I couldn't find my hat #
Oh hi!	Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.
Bud #	Yeah #
Look, you can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just do it because it's your job. And even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway.	Why?
You know what I really like?	# What's that?
Well don't you?	I think you should try not to think about this anymore.
Oh, hi.	Hi.
What's wrong?	I'll never be able to do that.
It's okay. We'll get you a new one.	I don't know what I'd do if I couldn't paint anymore Bud. I just don't know what I'd do #
It's beautiful.	Just a little--You know.
Hey.	Hey.
So uh # Maybe we could uh #	Cool.
Did you think that we'd all be looking at you?	No, no, no.
#yes I'm still on hold#	And what was this?
You just said very food.	Did I say that?
You're lucky. She couldn't come anyway --	Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
Hey, what are you doing? Why are you wearing a suit again?	I don't know.
Hey, hey, you should ask her out -- what do you think, she's cute, right?	I'm gonna call you back.
It's not cool?	It's fine, but --
Yeah I can't.	OH MY GOD. Look at that.
Goodbye.	Call me later.
Hello, this is Back.	Hi, is this Jack?
Hello?	Hey. What are you doing? How are you?
So you think you can?	No. I'm sorry.
Come on, I thought we had fun, rich boy --	This is not cool.
#MOTHERFUCKER, NO#.	She is. I think, why did you come here like this?
Hello?	You've just made a war that you cannot afford.
Is it ok if I leave my car you think?	I don't know.
Hi.	Hi.
Business is good, you're busy?	Yeah, not really.
Six months, maybe five, five or six months#do you wanna check that?	Are you guys hurt?
It was great to meet you again. To see you again, thanks for helping me yesterday --	Ok.
I'm going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me?	Sure.
This is funny.	Yeah.
#really? That's nice#are you lying?	#I thought I should tell you. I didn't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something --
That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you for saying that.  You're friends with my sister?	Yeah.
Is everything ok?	Yes.
I have a better idea of where we can go.	Ok.
There's a better place for us to eat.	Did something happen; are you alright?
That was good.	Yeah.
You got me out of my hotel room. You came and got me out of my room.	Yeah##yeah#..
Do you wanna have sex?	Yeah.
Where do you have to go?	For what?
I forgot about that.	Can I come home with you when we get there?
Are you ok?	I'm fine are you ok?
Why?	Just have you for one second, please.
Yeah.	Did you do it?
Can we agree that that is that?	That's that.
Sorry about that.	I didn't know you had a sister?
Yeah.	That was weird. I meant good.
What's up?	Well I'm sorry. Before#
What's up?	I think I got in trouble. A little bit of trouble#.
Hey.	Hi.
It's three hundred and twenty dollars, just take it.	What do you have in the house?
That's cool.	When can you leave?
So they'll go.	I'm only paying two of you guys.
He's wearing a suit again, I don't know why he's wearing a suit, he doesn't usually dress like that --	It's fine.
I'll go pay for my car.	Are you sure?
We should be going --	Yeah, no, I have to get something from my car, I said.
I can't find that thing in my car, I can't find it so I'll just get it and give it to you later. So?	You ready?
Go back to your room. Quickly.	What? What've I done?
Free his mouth.	Mustn't do that, sir.
What the devil --	If you won't be true to your word, then you've left me no choice.
Oh. That.	Well#?
Perhaps you'll be so kind as to remind me of her name#	I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it.
If you won't read it to your own Mama, then perhaps you ought not to be reading it at all.	It's not your cup of tea, Mama.
Doesn't that please you?	Very much.
So you ever gonna do a picture?	Not you too
Listen, you come down and stay with us for a few days. Just tell the old man that--	I can't
I did my best but, well, you know me	Sure
I wonder. Do you have any idea what you have done?	Do you?
How bad is it?	Nothing for you to worry about, darling
Then you explain it to me?!	There's nothing to explain
Fuck you, Mr. Kane.	I will not have this in my home.
He lied to me	He looked into my face and told me it wasn't about you.
Yes.	Please don't say this.
He'll destroy us.	Then let him. What have we got to lose, you and I?
So, who is he? We have to know him.	Everyone sees someone different. That's what we show.
I want you back	Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out.
If he had known about KANE before you made it, you'd be dead already.	It's too late. The movie's made
YOU STUPID, LITTLE MAN! HOW COULD YOU HAVE LET THIS HAPPEN?! I GAVE YOU MY SOUL AND NOW YOU'RE GOING TO SELL IT!?	This ain't George's doing--!
Shit	George#
You talked to New York?	Yes
Yes	Get out
I think you better sit down	I don't want to sit
Oh God. . .	Relax, George. It's gonna go great. Trust me. Have I ever lied to you?
How 'bout a real drink?	We done?
Oh, no--	Yes!
What's up, Colonel?	I'd like to talk to Jake a minute.
This looks done.	It's not done.
Where you going at this hour?	What're you, a cop? I'm goin' out -- business.
What's wrong?	Nothing#
Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?	I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
Answer me when I talk to you.	Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I#
Do you see her yet?	Give me a chance. Let me look.
You want us to wait for you?	No, take her home. I wanna be alone for a while. Everybody go.
Nah, she would never#	Didn't you just see her lookin' at him? She told me no, but I don't believe her.
Excuse me for a minute. Be right back.	Don't be long. I'm afraid with all these tough guys here.
Stick out your hands, Jake.	C'mon, Joey.
Screw you, Jack.	Where you been?
How's that?	I can't tell. You're stomach's in the way.
Don't fight anymore!  It's a free country, don't fight anymore!	Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it?
It ain't worth it, Jake. Get out.	What time is it?
Joey said you wanted to meet me. Is that right? You wanted to meet me?	I just wanted to say hello.
You don't talk very much.	I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
I can't find my ball.	Can you see it?
Can you see it?	No.
Jake, this is your father's bedroom.	That's all right. He don't mind.
Jake#	It's OK.
Are you sure we should be doing this?	Come over here.
Take off my pants.	Jake#
Now take the rest off.	Jake, you made me promise not to get you excited.
Now, touch me#  #here.	Oh, Jake.
What're you lookin' at? You lookin' at him?	No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.
Hey, you don't say goodbye to him like that.	What did I do?
But Jake# I didn't say anything#	Don't ever do that again. You don't  do it!
Where you been all day?	I took the kids to my sister's.
You know, if there's one thing -- I just don't understand you, not one single little bit. You love me?	Yeah --
Jake, why don't you just try lying down and get some rest.	I don't know what it is. I dunno, it's the kind of thing that -- the words won't come out.
I miss Joey. I wish Joey was here.	Why don't you just call him?
The kids are sleeping.	I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.
Hi, Tommy. How are you?	Jake, sit down for a minute.
How's the weight? Ok?	Yeah, the weight's Ok.
Talk some sense into him, will ya? You're still his brother. If he ain't gonna listen to you, he ain't gonna listen to nobody!	All right, I'll try. See you later.
I said, let's go.	Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?
I would say that is looked as if she wasn't coming back.	That's what they call a family problem.
Who said they left then?	Who left -- where?
Enough to scare me that you wouldn't get here in time, and we'd lose him.	You think he's getting out of here?
Did you ever own a saw?	Well, in the garage, back home, we --
Oh -- that phone call!  I gave them your number -- hope you don't mind.	That depends on who "they" were.
Read some good books.	I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
Hello.	Did you get my note?
Can you get me that ring back?	No.
I can't. The police have it by now.	Then if the police get me -- you won't be around to laugh!
I knew it!	Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else.	I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
You shouldn't have let her do that! If he ever --	Look!
I wonder.	What?
What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in?	Smart girl.
Something big going on somewhere?	Going on right here. It's a big night.
What a day I've had!	Tired?
Almost as if it were being written especially for us.	No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
If you're saying all this just because you don't want to tell me the truth, because you're hiding something from me, then maybe I can understand --	There's nothing I'm hiding. It's just that --
You don't think either one of us could ever change?	Right now, it doesn't seem so.
I'm not exactly on the other side of the room.	Your mind is. And when I want a man, I want all of him.
Don't you ever have any problems?	I have one now.
I wonder where he's going now?	I don't know.
Well, I guess it's safe to put on some lights now.	Not yet!
We have all -- what?	Night. I'm going to stay with you.
I have the whole weekend off.	Well that's fine, but I only have one bed, and --
Something's in there. Those flowers have been taken up, and put back again.	It could be -- the knife, and the saw.
Wasn't that close?	Too close.
I'll try to give you at least fifteen minutes.	How?
What's happening?	Good luck, Buzz.
You know something?	What?
Meaning me?	What?
Just him.	Stay there.
Sure.  It's fine.	Okay.
You see any cops?	No--
What time is it?	Hang loose.  We got all night.
Tell him why we moved here.	Hold it, Jim.
So long, young fella.  Knock 'em dead, like your old man used to!	Sure--  You know something?  I have a feeling we're going to stay here.
You thought I was Mom?	Yeah!
You awake?	Yes.
Blood.	How'd that happen!  What kind of trouble you in?
What can you do when you have to be a man?	Well, now--
Will you let him tell it!	She never wants to hear.  She doesn't care!
I don't think so--	Well--
Except yourself!	Will you wait a minute?
You know you did wrong.  That's the main thing, isn't it?	No!  It's nothing!  Just nothing! You always told me to tell the truth.  You think you can just turn that off?
You'll learn as you get a little older, Jim.	I don't want to learn that!
Son--this is all happening so fast--	You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something  Mom?
I don't see what's so bad about taking a little drink.	You don't?
Whoa!  Whoa!  I know you're a little upset but--	Sorry.
Excuse us a minute?	Sure.  Sure.
You sure?	I think I know my son.
I guess I cut pretty loose in my day too.	Really, Frank?  When was that?
No!	Did anyone see you there?  I mean did they get your license number or anything?
See?  It stopped.	I still think you should go down.
Who's there?  Anyone there?	Open it.
Is he there?	No, honey.  No, he's not here.
Frank!	Stay here.  That was my son!
They not together, sir.  We don't see him in a long time now.	Do you hear from him, son?
Excuse me--but--You know where I can find--I mean I don't remember his last name--	Look--can't you see I'm writing?
I think his first name's Ray--I have to see him.  It's very important.	What's the charge?
Hi.	Hi there.
Boy!	What?
What's your name!	Jim.  What's yours?
Listen, I told you not to fool with them.  Now they're waiting for you.	I know.  That's why I came back.
I'm here.	They're still there!
Jim--Do you think when the end of the world comes it'll be at night?	No.  In the morning.
I got to go in.  You better get home too.  Hey--what?	Why don't you come home with me?  I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you?  I don't have many--people I can talk to.
Jim!	Who's that!
Hey where'd you go?	I'm here.  Shut up.
I came here before.	When was that?
I don't want you for my father!	Your father!
No.	I promise nothing'll happen if you do.  You want my jacket?  It's warm.
Can I keep it?	What do you think?
Who's that?	Just a guard.
Those aren't my friends.  Make them go away.	Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back?
I'm sorry.	All right, darling.
Sit down and eat--you'll be late.	It'd stick in my throat, Mom.  I'm nervous or something--
What about the other boys--Do you think they'll go to the police?	What's that got to do with it?
He called me chicken.	And your folks didn't understand?
The kids take me.	Oh.
I'll bet you're a real yo yo.	A what?
You cold?	Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold.
Why did you do that?	I felt like it.
Where you going?	I don't know, but we can't stay here.
Ever been in a place like this before?	Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
No!	We have to go back!
After he tried to shoot you?	He didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him.  He needed us.
Is he your friend?	Yes.  My best friend.
She's being called for.	You said you'd call my father.
Good evening.	Hi.
Didn't you forget something?	What?
I was talking to Dad.	I didn't kiss her so it's a big thing.
Is this him!?	Don't hurt him#
You promised me!	And you promised me you'd get your sweetheart to help!
He wants the money.	No, baby. He wants me.
He wants# your "sister"#	#whoever she is.
I can't take watching you touch him. I can't take his hands on you.	One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.
I figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way --	No, no --
Do that again.	What.
I told you, Nick. Remember?	Tell me again.
Well, wasn't all me, y'know.	Yes it was all you --
Baby, c'mon, all this stuff# I haven't gotten you anything --	You got out, Nick. You're here. You're my Christmas.
NO!	NICK!
I'm not him. I#  You want something from Nick, you got the wrong guy.	Nick#
I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't hurt you anymore.	Your brother#
#the truck driver#	He's not a bad person, Nick# he's not#
You motherfucker.	Nick, no --
Get the hell off of me!	Nick, it won't work. It won't work!
He'll kill you.	You're not hearing me here --
Then they do need me, don't they. They really need me#	We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this#
That guy knows you?	Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike.
We get to the bridge, we're all right!	Nick, the ice is --
You saved my life.  You could have run, but you didn't. You saved me.	You saved me.
I'm sorry, Nick# I'm so sorry#	Don't say my name#
They'll have guns.	What?
He wants to see your map.	I'm almost done.
WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK!	Yeah. That's love.
You# you# YOU --	We still gonna spend Christmas together?
I saved your life.	You shouldn't have.
You# you don't know me --	Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well.
Who are you now.	You got the wrong guy! She thinks I'm Nick, I'm not!
Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.	She says a lot of things.
Where's she work?	What?
You knew the place --	Hey.
Hell. Ten?	And which of these doors here lead up to the security level?
What?	I said, who the hell made the map?
We walked the place for a week.	And I worked there. For a year.
They won't recognize me.	Why not.
You got one hour.	I'm gonna need some money.
Ten dollars? What do I do with ten dollars?	Don't tip.
Man, Monster# just# just don't start trying to hit me#	Nick. I been trying to hit you.
I want a map of that security level. Every room, every guard, every thing.	Six men means six guns.
Get in the CAR!	How'd you know my name#
#so where is he?	Where is he?! Where is he?!
I can't go back to Vegas#	OPEN IT!!!
I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK!	GO!!!
DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!!	DROP THE GUNS! NOW!
What's the first thing, man? What's the first thing you're gonna do?	Haven't thought about it.
She's gonna be out there, man. Right there. Right there waiting.	Yeah.
Why you gotta say a thing like that.	I'm just saying.
NO!!!	#for Christmas#
That was my card, pop! My card! You hit for my card!	I# sorry, Mister#
POP! That was My card!	But# I had a five#
Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas.	I'M NOT NICK!
Start talkin	Who the hell made this map.
That's what it looks like!	Since when? What the hell is this room?
Alone at last.	Now where were we?
I asked you a question. Are you clear about that?	Yes.
Holy shit, this guy's all fucked up!	No shit, he's gonna fuckin' die on us if we don't get him taken care of.
Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin' chance to breathe. I got a few questions of my own, ya know.	You ain't dying, he is.
I don't know what he did to her, but she got even.	Was he all pissed off?
Daddy, did ya see that?	What?
Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening.	That's okay, Eddie, I do.
We were set up, the cops were waiting for us.	What? Nobody set anybody up.
Brown's dead, we don't know about Blue.	Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue?
Nice Guy. When we got to the bar#	#What bar?
Jesus Christ!	You can do some crazy things with it.
Let's go over it. Where are you?	I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out.
Just hold on buddy boy.	I'm sorry. I can't believe she killed me#
That's great, guy, thanks a bunch.  When do you think you'll need me for real work?	Well, it's kinda a strange time right now. Things are kinda -
Give me this fucking thing.	What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Give me my book back!
I'll take care of this, you guys leave the tip.  And when I come back, I want my book back.	Sorry, it's my book now.
Joe, I don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong.	Like hell I am.
Larry, I'm gonna kill him.	Goddamn you, Joe, don't make me do this!
I know.	You do?
Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?	Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
Follow you where?	Down to my car.
For what, the cops?	Nice Guy Eddie.
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why the fuck didn't you say that in the first place?	You didn't ask.
I ain't going anywhere. I'm right here. I'm not gonna leave ya.	Larry, I'm so scared, would you please hold me.
Gun shot.	Oh that's just fucking great! Where's Brown?
Want a smoke?	Why not?
So, is he dead or what?	He ain't dead.
We ain't taking him to a hospital.	If we don't, he'll die.
Is that supposed to be funny?	We don't think this place is safe.
I told ya he'd be pissed.	What are you gonna do about him?
He seems all right now, but he went crazy in the store.	This is what he was doin'.
Who shot who?	Nobody. The light was bad.
You don't know how good it is to see you.	Maybe you won't feel that way after I tell you what I stopped in for.
Tell them to come on in.	But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.
If you were in his shoes would you take one of us home?	I'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it.
There's a nice boy.	Yeah.
So that was why she tried to run away.	Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
I'm sorry, but that's how it's got to be.	I suppose it is.
I hope you get everything you want out of life --	Thanks.
Are we leaving?	It's too light yet.
Better go on back and get some more sleep. You'll need it later on.	You're not going out to look for them?
Why did you change your mind about bringing us along?	Why do you think?
You wouldn't do a thing like that, would you?	Yes. But -- that was the other night. Now -- I don't think I would.
Tell me, darling.	What?
All my clothes --	That's right -- worry about your clothes --
So grab yourself some sleep while you have the chance.	If you want to go on, I can make it all right.
I won't have you fighting over me.	I'm sorry.
I can't change either. Not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand.	Hurry up.
I'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. Somebody who wants me as I am will maybe walk into the place where I'm working and take me out of there.	Maybe they will.
Goodbye. Thanks for the lift.	Goodbye, Mary.
Where you going?	To the other side of the street.
That job you were talkin' about, did you get it yet?	Why?
I -- lost something.	It wouldn't happen to be this#
I can't --	You've got to -- don't you understand -- they want me with them and they'll fix it so I have to go --
How does she draw?	A little hot.
There was only three of them at first. I guess I lost my head.	How'd you happen to miss?
A man can't help gettin' excited once in a while.	That's right, Steve.
Come on. We got a couple hours to eat and get some sleep.	I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
Go on, hit me.	Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
You know what she asked me?	I don't care what she asked you.
Half of them are mine.	You'll get your share. Go on. I don't want you around.
Is that the only reason you came back?	Sure. What other reason would there be?
Yeah, how did you know?	The whole state's lookin' for 'em.  And they're lookin' for me.
Go away -- please.	That's right -- you go back to sleep. Tomorrow when you feel better things will look a whole lot different. Don't you worry about anything -- Mary's going to talk things over with your folks --
She mustn't -- don't you let her --	There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
That sure smells good.	I like it.
I saw your fire and dropped by to say hello.	Well, say it.
Suppose I take a look.	Go ahead.
When I ask questions, I like to hear answers.	They went on like I told you.
Goodbye and thanks.	I don't like to see you go.
You think that's all we busted -- You should see#	Now where's she goin'? --
I tried my best, but these things take time.	And we're running out of that.
You're not giving up?	How many ways can a man say no.
Maybe I better start working on him.	You'd think he'd do it for Elaine's sake, at least#
Go on. Have another try at him.	What's the use.
Mary, Honey. I talked too much, like always -- he thinks you told Elaine the things I told her.	I don't care what he thinks.
How do you know who we are?	Everybody knows --
You said somebody was comin' back -- who's comin' back?	Stop it --
We got company. Female company.	Yeah, we sure have.
What are you doin' --	Lookin' around.
Is that your kind of reading, Steve?	I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at the pictures.
Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?	Since I can remember, Ma'am.
Would you like to learn them?	I sure would.
You're so nice.	Did someone say I wasn't nice?
And that's tough, isn't it?	Without someone to teach you, it's tough.
You don't know what it is to be sorry.	Steve --
Are you okay?	Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
No, I won't let you do it.	Alex, what are you doing?
My favorite memory was when we --	Would you die already?!
Help!	Now, why that bitch gotta bring that shit this way? I hope she didn't see me.
Oh my God! We're dead!	It would've just been you, if you would've kept your mouth shut.
It's coming!	What?! What is it, a monster?!
Shhh# It's okay.	Ray, have you been here all this time?
He's right. I should go first.	He's so brave.
Ray, run faster.	Okay.
But, hey, maybe we can be friends.	Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
Hi Buddy.	Open chest!!!
Buddy#	Wait, I'm just about to tell you the best part.
Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.	Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
He's here.	Shit!
What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I can't move, I'm so cold.	Can you feel that?
There's something I really want to share with you.	There's something I want to share with you too. Here, smell this.
What should we get?	I don't care. You pick.
Are you okay?	I think so.
Okay, I get the point.	So, whatever happened to her?
I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I#	It's okay.
Come in somebody. Can you hear me?	This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?	Yeah, I broke my fall.
Stop! --	Made you say it!
Would you like me to help you pass them back?	I don't need your help.
What the hell are you doing?	Just wait, you'll see.
What are we gonna do?	We have to destroy him.
Father!	My child, you're alive!
I'm sorry.	Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
So, do you think you made it into the class?	I don't know, but I sure hope so.
Did you do that?	Uh, uh.
I take it you're not mad at me.	I wouldn't go that far.
I don't like this, this#	Why don't you shut up, Professor? Just relax.
I think she's starting to suspect something?	Who?
Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.	Saw who?!
I can do it myself.	Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
Work, work, work. Is that all that you do?	Well, there's a lot riding on this project.
She's right. We should stick together.	Alright. Come on, you guys.
Alright# I might need your help.	My help?
You mean to tell me we're dead!	I guess so.
Father, are you okay?	Yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there.  Did you bring my bag?
Remember, don't ask her too many questions.	Because she will lie?
Oh shit, you gonna take that?	What?
No thanks.	My holy water.
Father, I think you should rest.	No, I'm fine.
Yo son, check this out.	Dog, you look hot.
"Ray!"	"Fucked me."
Did you hear?	What happened?
Here we go again.	He's really cute!
DAD! YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID IT??!	I DO! Mom's gone crazy!
I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.	I'm so happy I could shit.
Get in, Mom! I have to open.	This is so silly. 
That's cool# hey look, you're Carl's brother, right?	That's right.
Goodnight, honey.	Don't I get a kiss?
Did you see her?! She just said "Fuck you" to me!	Let the record show I'm just standing here.
And who may I ask is Carl?	Just a boy. He's picking me up this morning.
He killed people, Mom.	We all have bad nights. 
Murder, honey.	Now, here's a babe!
I don't like this.	Which room is it?
You scared?	Yes.
We can't stand here all night.	You could go and open the door.
How much does she want?	She could use a hundred dollars.
I haven't got that much in cash.	How much have you got?
What did she want?	I did her hair.
Thank you. It was a lovely dinner.	Good.
This is about another murder  a woman at Fifty Second Street	But you do believe me?
She's got to be found. That's the first step. She's got to be found so that she can give herself up to the police.	We've tried so long to find her.
Don't. We know what happened. Don't go on.	Any court in the land would understand. We'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we'll go to the police.
Do you think he knows about this?	I don't know.
Could you find him?	I suppose so. I can pick him up somewhere.
Let her know what?	That you love Mary.
She'll have to know some time.	Not from me.
You'll be all right?	Yes.
I want you to see my room. I want you to see all of it.	But it's a small room, Jason.
What was she to you?	I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
Wait  there is that other favor.	I'd forgotten.
If you like, I'll go with you to dinner.	I'd like that.
Would they hurt her?	I don't know.
This is incredible I It must be some sort of a joke.	I'm very, very serious.
But you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister.	I'm afraid not.
I'm afraid not.	That's too bad.
I'm worry to bother you. I want to ask you about my sister.	Yes?
No -- the rent in paid. The lady asked us to promise, I wouldn't open the door.	Please.
Ann?	Yes?
Do you have other things?	Yes.  Oh, you mean to bring in! No. Yes, I have some other things, no, I don't need to bring them in. This is all I need to stay here.
Have you ever been on television?	Television?
This food is excellent.	Thank you.
Would you mind?	No.
Yeah, I know. I mean, I'm not saying I know people think you're a bitch, I'm saying I know what you mean. And I don't even know that people think you're a bitch. Do they?	I feel like they do.
So what about kids?	Kids? What about them?
So what's your personal thing? Are you really going to tell me something personal?	Do you want me to?
Hi!	Ann. Hello.
It's a personal project I'm working on.	What kind of personal project?
I'm not sure why I came here. I had kind of decided not to talk to you after# you know.	I know.
But even if we had been speaking, I wouldn't have told you.	Why not?
Do you think that's such a good idea?	Don't you want to make one?
How do you pay for all this? I mean, rent, and tapes and this equipment.	I have money.
Do you talk to him?	When we're making love?
You don't know what I'm thinking.	It's a simple question. Have you ever thought of having -- making love with someone other than your husband?
Is he going to see this?	Absolutely not.
Did you have sex before you were married?	Yes.
You're really never going to make love again?	I'm not planning on it.
If you were in love with me, would you?	I'm not in love with you.
I can't.	Why not?
Don't do that.	Why not?
I want to touch you.	No.
Yes. I just got busy.	That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message.
Then maybe I saw an old message. There are a lot of them on my desk, you know.	Who'd you have lunch with?
You're leaving me for him, aren't you? Well, that makes a sad sort of sense. He can't, and you won't.	I'm not going to discuss this with you anymore. You're making no sense.
Bastard#	He does.
You son of a bitch!!	Not very often.
I have thought about it, yes.	You bitch. I knew it.
God damn you!!	Yes.
When did you begin having this feeling?	About a week ago. I don't know what brought it on, I just started feeling like I didn't want him to touch me.
I hate my sister.	Why?
Is he? Strange, I mean?	Not really. Maybe if I just saw him on the street I'd have said that, but after talking to him# he's just kind of# I don't know, unusual.
Besides, even if I decided to fuck his brains out, what business is that of yours?	Do you have to say that?
I don't# he doesn't want you to come over.	What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
In front of him, Ann, yes.	You are in trouble.
Here it is.	What is it?
I was just trying to --	Hold on.
Thank you.	Well. I can't stay.
Do you have my work number?	No.
I get real busy between two and four.	Okay.
Bye.	Bye.
Did he ask me to take my clothes off? No, he didn't.	Did you take your clothes off?
Oh, okay. I think I get it.	What do you get?
John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.	Is that what he tells you?
Hello.	Hi.
Look, I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here, okay?	Okay.
No.	No? Not even one more?
I've got to get back to the office.	I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.
John?	In here!!
Do you want me to stop calling?	Look, I'll call you, okay?
Come on, John. You should be happy, we've gone this far without Ann finding out, I'm making it real easy on you. Just walk out of here and I'll see you at your house for a family dinner sometime.	Did he put you up to this?
Plenty of room for two people.	It'll just be me.
I wish I didn't have to live someplace.	What do you mean?
Get rid of the car when you get your apartment, then you'll still have one key.	I like having the car, the car is important.
Give me your keys.	My keys?
Your keys, asshole!! Your two fucking keys!! Give them to me!!	I'm not going to give you my keys.
Hi.	Hi. Want a drink?
Anything wrong?	No. I don't think so.
Can I call you at the office?	What do you want to call me at the office for?
Right. It's crazy. But here's the beauty part. Ready?  Who cares?	I don't get it.
But you'll think about what I said about working together, huh?	OK. I'll think about it.
He didn't make it.	Huh?
NIGHT NIGHT	NIGHT NIGHT
BREAKING OUT	BREAKING OUT
You got it!	I got it!  I got it!!!
We've been hearing some bad things about you, Brad.	He needs help.
That's us.	I don't want to get up there.
I'M LOOKING FOR LOVE	I'M LOOKING FOR TRADE
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART	YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
Could I do that later?	Of course.
But they only think they're happy.	That doesn't make sense.
Oh my poor baby.	Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
You shouldn't have said that.	Why?
I NEED SOME	YOUNG BLOOD
No!  He's never done that before.	Good!  Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.
I want to see Brad.	I understand your concern, but I feel it's time you started thinking of yourself.  Look at yourself.
Our field.	What does he know about it?
WHAT A JOKE#	WHAT A JOKE#
And none of them worked?	No.
Isn't she lovely?	Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.	I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?	I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
Don't bother him with that. We got to get going.	It'll just take a second.
Are you there? Miles?	Yeah, I'm here.
How's it hanging, Miles?	You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
You okay, Miles?	I'm good.
How you doin' tonight, beautiful?	Good. How're you?
I can explain.	You said you loved me! You fuck! I hope you die!
Whoa, why are we getting off?	I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second.
Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?	She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
That's what you do with every one.	When do we get to drink it?
You know, you could work in a wine store.	Yeah, that would be a good move.
Hey Jack, hurry up!	Just a minute!
Nice, huh?	Beautiful.
Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!	I want to go home now.
We're on.	What?
Pull yourself together, man.	I'm fine!
Where were you?	Bathroom.
You should call her.	I will.  See ya!
Hey, there you are.	Yep.
Besides what?	Well# I don't know, just# the wedding.
Call me on my cell if you go out.	Yeah.
Nice shot.	You're an asshole.
What about your agent? Hear anything yet?	Nope.
Don't come over the top. Stay still.	Shut up.
Is it the money thing?	Is what the money thing?
We're on.	What's happening?
Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is yo' daddy?	Put me down, Jack.
What's it look like to you?	Looks like you were in a bad car accident.
You know what I'm thinking?	What's that?
We gotta go back.	What?
She tell you she was married?	Yeah.
So what's the plan?	The plan is# you go.
Fuck you. I'll get it myself.	Hold on.
Yep. Quite a day.	Quite a week.
Want me to drive?	No, I'm okay.
Come on, let me drive.	I'm fine. You rest.
What the fuck!	You said it looked like a car accident.
Look at this!	I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
You broke some.	Whatever. Sorry.
Well. That about does it.	Why don't you come in?
Love you, man.	Back at you.
You want to join us?	Sure.
So how's that book of yours going, Miles? I think you were almost done with it last time we talked.	I finished it.
Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack.	See you.
Hi.	Hey.
Bathroom over there?	Yeah.
Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me.	Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.
Were you ever going to say anything?	Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth.
I've told him. I've told him over and over, but he's out of control.	Do you know what he's been saying to her?
Hello?	Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
I guess I just thought there was still some hope for us somewhere down the road and I just, I just --	Miles, maybe it is better if you don't come to the wedding.
Sir, what are you doing?	I told you I need a drink.
Where's Jack?	He had to make a phone call.
Hi, guys. We should probably get going.	Where?
What's the matter?	I saw a monster. Can I have a glass of water?
What are you thinking about?	Why do you talk to mom when you're by yourself?
It makes me feel better.	Does she ever answer back?
Daddy.	Don't touch him.
I don't want you to die.	Who said I was going to die?
I'm scared.	Me too.
Does it hurt?	I don't feel much.
It was very dark.	Yes it was.
It was very dark.	Yes, it was.
Should we turn off the lights?	They already know we're here.
They're on the roof.	While they were trying to fix her up, all she kept asking about was you.
He was only a year and half old.	What are you doing?
We won't be able to get out of there.	I'm sorry I hurt your arm.
I can feel air.	Me too.
No.	Listen, there's things I can take and a couple things I can't and one of them I can't take, is when my older brother --  -- who is everything I want to be, starts losing faith in things. I saw your eyes last night.  I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again, okay? I'm serious.
That's good enough for me.	Me too.
I'm getting out now.	Don't do it.
What do you think about the idea that they don't like places near water, and we might be safe from them near a lake or something?	Sounds made up.
We'll have to board up the bedroom doors.	Where are we going to sleep?
Did someone save me?	Yeah baby. I think someone did.
Second thing this week I can't explain.	What was the first thing?
I don't think so.	Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
Is anything missing?	No.
But I'll tell you something, what I said in their, still goes. You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days# Not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago.	Six months.
There was an accident. Drunk driving. They weren't sure.	He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
Is that him?	Yeah.
Don't do it!	You'll lose the signal!
I'd get down if I were you. They may be up there now.	No money, eh?
All I did was kiss a girl.	That's why they got you in jail?
So I did, I got out of there, I don't want no trouble. You know me.  So I walked out on the street and the fella tried to shoot me in the back.	#And you had to kill him?
Well, no, not exactly. See then his friend opened up on me.	What friend is that?
I think we lost 'em.	There's nobody coming?
Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and kids.	Your next water ain't for three days.
I didn't know you were out.	Did it seem short to you?
Maybe we'll see you sometime.	Yeah# maybe. So long.
#Gotta go#	Sure.
Where are we?	Someplace safe. How you feeling?
This was my father's. The men who killed him took it.	I'm sorry.
I gotta get to my brother. If they came after me, they'll want him too.	You'll never make it.
I'll go. I'll bring Jake out here.	Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.
I almost didn't.	Where's Jake?
Gotta go.	Right.
More than enough.	Have you thought at all about your plans?
I'm surprised to see you out here tonight.	I just came out to say goodbye.
You came all the way out here to tell me you're going to California? All you had to do was go, and we'd never see each other again.	That's why I'm here.
I'm just meeting a guy here and moving on. So far I haven't been able to find him.	In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
Maybe I ought to throw you in jail too. Then you could be with all your friends.	I haven't done anything.
Doesn't look quite fair.	Which way do you mean?
You'll have to deal me out on that. I've had some experience with that sort of thing, and I don't want any more.	I understand.
Then I guess this is where we part ways. Sorry.	No hard feelings.
Where you been?	Oh, I was just checking the, ah#  #you know, lookin' in.
A lot of men have told me that. Maybe it's true. I guess some women are slow to believe it.	Believe it.
Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?	We didn't get that far.
Where's your brother?	He'll be here.
This a friend of yours?	He is now.
Get out of here, Jake.	All I did was kiss the girl.
New record.	Let's get out of here.
What are you talking about?	I'm done talking. Get out.
Who's going to pay for all this, Sheriff?	Don't press your luck, Carter.
He was murdered.	Who did it?
Why him?	Shut up. You need help, don't you?
I got there just short of too late.	Lucky.
He must be pretty good.	He's good, all right. Too good for my men. That's why you've got to take care of it.
You got a place to stay?	I just got to town.
Easy, boy. Just an idea.	Well, thanks, but forget it.
What is it you want from me?	Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
I'm going to have to look into this.	Yeah, maybe I will too.
You work here?	I run the place. What can I get you?
What's this?	That's the good stuff.
Where's the dog now?	He left me.
What is it that I can't figure?	What do you mean?
What makes you say that?	If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
How about you?	I don't want you to get hurt.
I've got a place I can hide her.	You better get in there with her until this thing is over.
Where is she?	Good to see you too, Elaine.
Sorry I didn't get her back in time.	No problem.  Do you want to come in?
Maybe you're right.  Twelve years after your daughter's born you decide to become a father.	Better late than never.
She was there.  She didn't by any chance happen to mention me?	She said you were very beautiful.
Can I see you later -- go away for the weekend?	How can you bring that up at a time like this?
Hello?	Hello, is this Elaine?
"Why are we here?  Is that what you're asking, Jack?# Why are we here?  No why.  Just here".	Please put your clothes on
No, I'm okay.	Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
You have to see her.	I've seen them all before.
Hi, Dad.	Hello, sweetheart.
Can't you stop that?	Why?
Why didn't she thank you?	She did# didn't she?
-- I can't accept it.  I don't want a car, Dad.	Why not?  I can get you something else.  What do you want?
You love her, don't you, Max?	Don't you?
It's a hotel.	I don't understand.
A lot's happened since we last saw each other.	Yes.
Would you like me to read?	Yes, I'd like that.
You know you're really very good. I take back what I said.  I mean, you're really good.	Thank you.
You mean they buy it?	Buy it?  They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.
You did create me.	No.  I# just helped bring someone else's dream to life.
Wow. They called you their son.	We can keep it in the bathroom.
--My God.	--Do I know you?
Are you calling me?	What? You don't see enough of me at the store?
Why did you leave me?	I didn't leave you.
I just needed to do a couple of things.  And I needed to tell you something.	Tell me.
That's very sweet. I'm okay.	Do you think I should stop by on my way back? Show you what I got? It's not a problem.
You know that's probably not the best idea. I'll just wait to see them in the store.	Okay. Fine. Understood.  I'm off then.
I'm going to see you again, right?	If it's okay with you?
And Cole, next time I won't be late for you.	Next time I won't be scared of you.
Where should I look then, Cole?	Look over there.
He hates me.	You hate him?
You ever tell her about how it is with Tommy?	I don't tell her a thing.
What'd you write?	Words.
That isn't magic.	What?
I didn't know you were funny.	I forgot myself.
What makes you think that?	Your eyes told me.
How often do you see them?	All the time. They're everywhere.  You won't tell anyone my secret, right?
#No.	Will you stay here till I fall asleep?
When they get mad, it gets cold.	Them?
Can I ask you then?	Yes.
I have to.	When?
--What?	Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it.
Something happened, didn't it?	Yes, it did.
You really look better.	Maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in# And then all of a sudden, it's all taken away. No one asked them. It's just gone#
I believe both of you now.  And I think I might know how to make them go away.	You do?
What if they don't want help? What if they're just angry and they want to hurt somebody?	I don't think that's the way it works, Cole.
She came a long way to visit me, didn't she?	I guess she did.
I wish I were somewhere else.	Where will you go, where no one has died?
Don't go home, okay?	I definitely won't.
I think we said everything we needed to say.  Maybe it's time to say things to someone else? Someone close to you?	Maybe.
You were great in the play, Cole.	Really?
They're right here.	Oh.
You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again?	Don't get mad.
You know that accident up there?	Yeah.
You can see her?	Yes.
Where is she?	Standing next to my window.
I would never think that about you# ever# Got it?	Got it.
She wanted me to tell you--	Cole, please stop.
Yes, Cole?	They used to hang people here.
I don't like people looking at me like that.	Like what?
Excuse me?	You talked funny when you went to school here. You talked funny all the way to high school!
What--	You shouldn't laugh at people. It makes them feel bad.
How did you--?	Stop looking at me.
#He doesn't get invited places.	It's our pleasure.
Maybe you don't want to remember.	What are you talking about?
I'd watch your step if I were you, son.	Oh yeah? Why's that?
Hey! Don't use all the hot water!	Keep your shirt on! I'm almost done!
Let me guess. We're going on a "long trip".	Not according to these.
Hi.	#Hi.
Thought your boy and his band were only staying the night.	Bus broke down.
Well, there goes our record deal.	Nah. We still got Billy Bob.
You're out of your mind, man.	I am not! I'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
We've got to call someone -- get the sheriff--	The Sheriff?! We don't need the sheriff!!! We need to get the hell out of here!
How# was she "called?"	Pardon?
You'll be back.	I don't think so.
Throw me one.	Not while you're driving.
What the fuck you talking about, man?	He's right. You were behind.
Yeah. That's just the problem.	Tell me you checked the bus before we left, Carl.
My father and I don't exactly see eye to eye.	About what?
We're almost ready. What the hell are you doing out here?	I# heard something# came in here last night. Must have gone to sleep.
No Mac, please# I --	Don't look.
Mac# let's get out of here.	Don't you see? Whatever's going on# I'm part of it.
Get out of here.	No. Not without you --
I almost thought for a second#	Never.
Where's Mac?	Who knows? Just like a man# never around when you need them.
Carl.	CARL??? Carl did this?!!
Someone better tell Mac.	Why bother?
It gets worse. He's cut all the phone lines.	What'll we do?
Shit.	Bill, we need to talk!
What you up to?	Just checking out the lights.
Pretty, ain't they?	I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
Grant, where'd you go?	Hey, Grant.
Maybe she's ever called the house, or -- ?	No. What
Bill, I heard what you're doing. I think I should go along.	Why? Listen, it doesn't matter. I gotta go.
Was always curious why you# married Grant in the first place# Just never seemed outta love.	I know what people say, Bill. I# Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
What are you doing?!	We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.
Where are you?!	We're coming your way, man!
What?	Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.
I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.	What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, Bill?
You're lookin' awful pretty.	Shut up.
Sure thing, killer.	What can I do you for?
What are you doing?	You're pretty.
But not always. I was -- He was# other stuff too.	What other stuff?
Where'd he go?	We ain't never gonna find that girl now.
Get your hands off my daughter!	Your what?
So tell me about yourself.	Okay.
Guess what?	I give up.
Can I ask you something?	Shoot.
Well?	We lost him.
What the hell are you doing?!?	He's after us again!
You know this guy, don't you?	I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out.
Where did you learn how to drive like this?	Like what?
I'm proud of you.	Yeah?
What are you gonna do when you get home?	Sleep for a week.  Wanna join me?
Well, at least it hasn't been boring.	Well, thanks for the lift.
Why should I?	Because I need your help, sweet thing.  And I need it bad.
What do you want me to do, Hot Pants? Beg?	Yes.
Order up!	That's me.
Sure I can't interest you in anything else?	Another time.
How long's this gonna take?	I don't know, man. Ask him?
Never mind. It's nothing.	Anything else you don't want me to know?
-- How we doing?	It's gonna be close. Real close.
Have any trouble getting here?	About one to five years worth.
Shut up, Fred.	Who's Fred?
Yeah, shit -- hell, you're right. I'm sorry.	You shot me and murdered my friends.
Are you on a land line?	Yeah, why.
D'you talk to'm?	I got his machine.
What'd you say?	I said I got his machine.
Do you want me to say I did it?	I was kinda hoping, yeah.
They're gonna give on this in the next ten seconds or the deal's off!	I dunno what to say to you sweetheart, it is what it is.
I can't discuss --	-- You can and you will.
#Does he know?	#He does now#
No question, no, you're right. We gotta do what's good for us now.	Fuckin' A, first survive, yes?
So how we lookin'?	Good. This thing's on track, looks like it's gonna get done.
You have to give me your word you won't come in.  Then I'll come out.	All right.
They shouldn't let people like you into space.	Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.
Meaning Man can do whatever the fuck it wants?	Yes.
You killed her!	Not her.  It.
She'll come back.	No, she won't.
Where's Snow?  Did you call him?	Yes.
Is there anybody else here?	Why, who did you see?
How much sleep do you need?	How much sleep?
Was her breakfast conversation that bad?	Shut up.
What will you say?	To who?
She knows everything.  She knows who she is.	She knows everything?  Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
What's wrong with you?  We need your help.	I won't be making the trip.
When did this happen?	Oh, right away.  That's why you never saw me with anyone.  You should've noticed that.  I miss him, though. I think I made a mistake.
Oh, God.  I'm awake.	Yes.
I need to see Snow.	I'll go with you.
Don't.	Why?
We're taking a flight?	Yes.
You want to fuck her?	Stop it.
You're better when you take them.	I know, I know.  But still, somehow I don't feel better.
What do you remember?	What do you mean?
What happened?	You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?
Where've you been?	I been thinking about how much I hate you.
What happened to us, exactly?	You don't know?
Why did you say those things?	I don't know.  I couldn't understand why you didn't tell me.
Do you have any idea how much I like fucking you?	I think so.
I like that too.	How could she not be real?  I can smell her, taste her.  She does exactly what she did# it's not possible.
You sure say "God" a lot when we're doing it.	I know.  I'm putting that in my next report.
Do I really feel like# I am#?	Yes.  Yes.
What's wrong.	You don't love me.
I'm sure there are worse people to talk to, but I don't know who they are.	I'm just trying to understand what's going on.
Can you sleep?	I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me.
Do you want to stay here?	Do you?
What's happening to us?	It's all right.
That won't happen again.  We're different.	How can I tell?  You've seen both of me.  I only know what you're like here.  You're all I know.  There is no "You" from before.
What do I have to do to stop it?	I want you here.
What does it want?	I don't know.  Something.  Anything.
Where did you go before?	When?
He won't do it.	Why do you say that?
Snow, get up here, now.	I'm not Snow.
I got rid of him.  I wanted to see if# I wanted to be the only one. I wanted to be Snow.	Fuck me.  I knew it.
I've never seen anyone killed before.	It's okay# I've never been a detective before either#
Straight ahead.	Hard to find doors in this place.
Hi.	I'm sorry.  I'm not sure how this works.  I have to go out# is that all right?
Are you nervous?	No, Ma'am.
Would you pick one out, please?	Beg pardon?
Put it on my account, please.	I got money.
You can touch me, I won't bite.	Not too sure about that.
You all right?	Yeah.
Didn't do very well, did you?	Nope# never finished one yet.  I hate these things.
So, this could be your last night, huh?	Could be, I guess.
Good night, Mike.	Sleep good.
You put me life in danger.	No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again#
Stop, will you?!	Let go!
Yeah.	They called here after you left#
I don't know you#	This is me, Mike.  There's nothing else#
You told her?	Not exactly.
What a memory.	Do you dance?
It wouldn't work.	I know.
I'd miss my life#	# Don't explain.
How long you going away for?	Long enough.
I'll have to pack a lot of clothes.	Yeah#
Everyone's all right#?	Yeah.  It's all over.
So.	So.
You still going away?	I don't know#
I'll miss you, Mike.	Listen, I'll# see you again.
Say goodbye, Mike.	You take care.
# just saying you should think twice about it#	# I don't want to talk about it#
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?	Sure we are, let's go!
Mom, what's going to happen with you and Dad?	I don't know Tommy.
Tommy#!	I'm all right.
Mike?	What?
Tomorrow, I start looking for our house# You love me?	You got no idea#
Bought it.	It's not your taste.
Coming to bed?	Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
Mike, take it easy#	Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
What did you do tonight?	I watched TV.
Let me drive#	Get away from me# get away!  She means that much to you, you stay with her.  But you come back, you come back for me.  Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
I'm going to visit my sister for a few days.  I'd like you to get your stuff out.	What about Tommy?
He doesn't want to sleep here.  Neither do I.  It's not my house anymore.	Me neither.
What do you think?  Any chance?  There's nothin' else I'm any good at, but this.	Call me next week.  We'll talk about it.
Are you in charge here?	No, sir#
You're not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer.	She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness.  Could I ask you to step outside, please.
Hold it#!	I'll prove it!
How do I know that's her?	I'll bring her in.  You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
Under the table.	I'll take his place, all right?  Put the gun to my head.
Watch your step!	What the fuck you doin'?!
How do you know where the gun is?	I know where everything is.
How are things going, pal?	Okay, I guess.
Peter-- you took this picture?	Let me see.
Here you go, Pete.	Uh, Uncle Ben, I--
Ya set for, uh, ya know-- money?	Oh, sure.
I was there.	See?
Eh.  Week from tomorrow.	How about tomorrow?
All right, amazing.  Are you quite finished?	Just about.  You see, I also have this amazing strength#
Are you quite finished?	Just about.  See, I also have this amazing strength.
Maybe I was hiding.  For years, I never told Ben the one important thing.	He knew.
No.  I was lying about the coffee.	Thank God.
My my.	Yeah.  Really gets to you if you let it.
What are you doing this weekend?	I've gotta study.
-- but at least Aunt May's okay now. I really have to stop by the hospital this afternoon.	Do you mind if I come too?
I'm sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.	Just shut up and close your eyes. This'll hurt.
May's much better. She'll be out soon.	Oh, God, I forgot to--
Peter?	I'm here#
Hold it.  Can we stop being clever, just for a moment?	Why?
It's Friday night#	Yes.  Do you have a date?
The record--	It'll shut itself off.
Need any more help?	No, thank you.  I'm sure you've got your own problems.
What's wrong with him?	Plenty.
Ready?	Roger.
There's only one pair left.	We'll get some more.
What's the matter? You on their team now? You think I'm the guy?	I don't know anymore.
Here's the knife to do it with. Only make sure you got the right throat.	We're looking at it.
Brother, were we all wet about you!	Forget it.
Break it off!	How much more do we have to take from him?
Then we're all in on it?	Everybody but Joey, and you know who.
You killed them, huh? Both of them?	Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
That's the general idea.  Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned.	You are talking crazy!
Let me go! Let me go!	They'll shoot you, Animal!
No, Animal.	No?
Easy, Animal! Easy!	Where'd that come from?
Thanks. You're a real pal!  What're we goin' to do with it?	Plant it, Animal, and grow us a chicken for Christmas.
There, Joey -- ain't that better than being a lawyer?	Animal! Got a little something for you!
I'll open mine now.	I'll open mine, too.
Come on, Animal -- let's trip the light fantastic!	Let me alone.
May I have this dance, Miss?	Why, sure!
You must get out. For your own good, you must get out.	Come on, everybody!  Let's go!
Yeah?	Give this to Joey, will you?
I'll make it five hundred!	No! No!
It's working.	Where is he?
But that wasn't so long ago. It couldn't have been more than#	Twelve years, sir.
I get it. I get it.	You get what?
Data, this isn't the time.	I am sorry, but I cannot stop myself. I think something is wrong
Well, may we have a look around?	Please, please.
Beautiful day, isn't it?	Yes, yes, it is.
No, no, it's not. It's better.	Better?
Captain of the Enterprise, huh?	That's right.
I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right.	Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
But I do have a theory#	I thought you might.
Keep her together until I get back.	I always do.
Sir?	Make it so.
Captain, are you all right?	Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.
What's going on? When do we get paid off#?	Soon, Captain# Quite soon.  
I don't believe it#	What is it?
Hello, sir. It's David.	David# Sorry I'm late.
Captain, please -- we'll take the risk. We've got to find out what it is#	# Or who.
Whoever they are, they're getting closer.	I'll go#
Mr. Scott#	I'm sorry, sir, but as far as I'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
Steady# Steady# All right, Mr. Scott.	Sir#?
How many more?	Just him, sir!
What happened#?	He gave his life to save us. That is all I know.
Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.	What? What are you saying?
I know you# Do I not?	Yes. And I know you.
Yes, yes, Spock#	The ship# Out of danger#?
Gentlemen. Good evening.	Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
Welcome aboard, Admiral.	Welcome home, Jim.
Admiral, I don't understand. The Enterprise --	Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over#
Bones!#	One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
Share this with no one.	Understood, my lord.
But what if they went -- nowhere?	Then this will be your big chance to get away from it all.
You okay, Jim? How do you feel?	Young. I feel young, Doctor.
David was right, wasn't he? It's just to keep them busy.	Why? Why didn't you tell me?
David --	Mother, go back!
Jim --	Go back. I'm going to kill him.
David. Please.	This is just to give us something to do, isn't it?  Come on.
You're crazy -- !	I saw it -- !
But the child --	Never mind! Hurry!
Why didn't you tell me?	She's making it up! My father was Professor --
I was wrong about you. And I'm sorry.	Is that what you came here to say?
Let go -- he can't -- !	Only half of you would get there.
What are you looking at?	The Admiral's son.
What are you looking at?	I don't know.
Time's up, Admiral#	Here it comes. Now, Spock.
If he hadn't, we'd be space by now.	Admiral, this is Spock.
There's a first time for everything, Admiral.	To be sure, Captain.
They knew just where to hit us.	WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And why?
All right, join the party. Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.	Aye sir --
Spock!	The ship -- out of danger?
# the good of the few#	Or the one.
Yes.	Take the test again.
That was close --	They just don't want us going in there.
Time from my mark#	Two minutes, ten seconds.
Time!	Three minutes, thirty seconds.
Yes, well, why don't you show him around and#	Aye, sir --
He's not what I expected, Sir.	What did you expect, Lieutenant?
Certainly#	By the book#
I do not understand the final question#	You are half human. The Computer knows that.
How're you doing?	Fine. Just fine.
No!  No# What did you have in mind#?	A moment alone, please.
You sure this is such a bright idea?	What do you mean?
Bones, stay here.	No way -- somebody has to keep an eye on him!
Congratulations, Jim. I think you've saved the Earth.	Not me, Bones# They did it.
You just said there aren't any except on Earth of the past.	That is what I said, Doctor.
All right, Commander, you wanna tell us anything?	Like what?
You sure you won't change your mind?	Is there something wrong with the one I have?
Memory problems, too.	Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
What's that?	What's what?
# What does that mean?	He means our chances of getting home are not very good. You might have lived a longer life if you'd stayed where you belong.
Spock#	Yes?
Mr. Spock, where the hell is the power you promised me?	Admiral, you must wait one damn minute.
Any luck#?	Nothing# I should never have left him#
With pleasure.	Well, that's different.
There's one thing I don't understand.  In three hundred years#you never learned to swim?	I just# haven't gotten around to it yet.
My father told me I shouldn't talk to you.	I understand.
Perhaps it would surprise you to know that I have often tried to imagine what it would be like to be a child#	Really?
I have to go home now.	Bye.
Can he breathe under water?	Data doesn't breathe.
Yes# that looks like them.	What's the last thing you remember, Data#
We're taking this ship out of here# this mission is over#	It is not over.
Will that stop the tear?	You got me, Commander.
I don't think they believe us.	Why not?
I wish there was a way to bring them back home.	Ask them.
Why would we be involved with these people?	Good question.
You haven't done that in a long time#	What#?
Yes#	Then take the final step# give me the Enterprise# and we can be together# always.
Isn't it better like this#?	Yes# but the Enterprise# my duty#
No# no, it's so# empty# please# give it back# I need it#	And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind.
This must be it.	How serious is the damage?
Ready to make a little history?	Always am.
Where in the States?	Oh# here and there. You know how it is.
You seem to have an answer for everything.	Something wrong with that?
Take care of him. He's a very special man.	Yes, he is.
What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on?	Ah# yes# but, I didn't realize that --
What?	You're lying.
You're leaving, aren't you?	I have to#
Target locked!	Fire!
Good luck, sir.	I'll keep in contact. You have the Bridge.
Return to our own time?	Yes, sir.
Yes, sir. But Captain# are we# all going back?	Unless you'd like to stay.
Report!	We've lost Bridge control!
I have to admit there was a moment there when --	Hold that thought.
Good luck, Captain.	I'm going too. They may need a doctor.
I believe the operation is over.	The charge is murder.
Spock, that was actually funny.	We DO sleep lying down.
Calm yourself, doctor, the operation is almost complete#	Thank you, nurse. Jim, she's ready! Lock and load!
Or not to be -	That's the question -
Uh, Jim#	You heard the order, Lieutenant.
Sweet Jesus#! He's lost a lot of whatever this stuff is#	Can you - ?
What is it with you, anyway?	Still think we're finished?
Jim, leave me - I'm finished#	No way.  You see this?
ABSOLUTELY NOT!	Come on#
I don't believe we can get more out of the way than this.	They'll make it look like an accident#
I've always wanted to meet you, Captain.	I'm not sure how to take that.
He's a DOCTOR!	How can I trust --
Are those your words?	Yes.
Just the size of my head -	I know what you mean#
From Starfleet?	Who else?
Course heading, Captain?	Second star to the right - and straight on till morning#
Your friends are late#	They'll be here#
Isn't it about time you became something else?	I like it here#
What took you so long?	Kill him! He's the one!!
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.	There's gotta be a way out of this place#
Stand down your weapons.	Captain, if --
This is incredible -	WHO ELSE#?
I hope you're happy.	Captain.
We HAVEN'T fired -	According to the data bank, we HAVE - twice#
Captain#	He was just about to explain the whole damn -
You must have faith.	Faith#?
Her own father#?	Such things have happened before, sir.
Trouble?	We've been ordered to -
Do you know who I am?	You are me.
Do you know where you are?	I am in a room with lights.
Can you remember our father?	No.
Data!	Sorry, sir.
Sir, allow me to go. You are needed here.	Negative.
No.	I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?
If you wouldn't mind.	Thank you.
May I have this dance?	With pleasure, Captain.
I'm going to miss you.	And I you.
How can you be certain?	I know how he thinks.
But how can he? He'll kill you.	This isn't about me anymore.
He can never know you as I know you# He can never touch you as I touch you.	This isn't real.
I'll always be with you now. Now and forever.	You sick bastard!
I'm afraid that drink will have to wait, Captain.	Do you have life support?
What's he doing?	He wants to look me in the eye.
He thinks he knows exactly what I'm going to do.	Sir?
To find the head, sir?	If you don't mind.
No!	Captain!
What's this?	Your new chair, sir.
Strength in numbers?	We can only hope so.
But she's not the Enterprise.	I promise you in time, she'll become your home #If I could offer you one piece of advice?
Right now, youe thinking this all sounds too good to be true?	Yes.
You don't trust me.	I have no reason to.
That's your life# not mine.	Please.
How long?	A matter of hours now.
Right in line with that burning tree.	I don't see anything.
What did I tell you?	Probably kids.
Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook. That's how I make money.	I understand.
Do you have children?	No.
What do you think of America?	It is beautiful.
No!!! No!!!	He's got a gun!!
Where did you stop last?	What the hell do you think you're doing?
It's real, George.	There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure?
We'll need a lot of help, George. You could hide an army up here.	I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need.
No deal.	I'm afraid we can't let you go.
George# Do you hear me, George?	What?
I won't let anyone hurt you.	Watch it. They're coming out.
Please#	Don't# don't do this# please#
Please.	Why are you doing this to me? I'll give you whatever#
Please#	Which way do you want to go?
What?	What.
Ah# no#	Ah no.
What?!	Eh# police.
Which way?	That way.
Money.	Money.
No gas.	No gas.
No gas# car dead.  We need gas. I don't want to get shot for running out of gas.	Gas good?
Go.	It's closed# closed. We need one that's open.
What?	Not what. Who. What is for things.  What? What? What? What? For people you use who. Who is he?  Who is she?  Who are you?  Who am I?
Who are you?	I am#
That's a big help. Where are you from?	From?
Gas.	Closed.
No gas.	I know.
Who?	My# husband.
Shit.	Shit?
In your pocket, please#	You. Mouth closed.
Money.	Yes.
What is#  #Coke?	A drink.
What's the matter?	Shit!
What?	Music.
I will see it next time.	You better.
Why are you going here? What is here?	My#  #car will take me#  #up there# home.
When do you have to be here?	I do not understand.
Sun#	Yes.
Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car.  That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go.	When we get here.
Don't worry. They're not going to hurt you. Come on.  Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don't lose it.	Can I have the gun?
Don't be afraid. Do what I told you and you'll be okay.	Yes.
Well# I'm going to go now.	Go?
Goodbye.	What?
What happened?	I was afraid.
Why did your ship land on this planet# on Earth?	It was a mistake.
What are you doing?	Are you my friend?
Nobody knows.	Why?
I like this music.	I've noticed# Do you understand what they're saying?
Do you have music up there?	Yes.
Put that back.	But I have never seen this before. I am not complete.
You shouldn't drink so much of that stuff. It's bad for you.	On the radio they say it's good.
The machine gave me two. Should I put one back?	No. Get in.
Are you angry at me?	No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.
Where are you going?	I must meet my ship.
Asshole!!	Where did you learn that?
We're not going to get a ride tonight.	I can't stay on this planet.
What are you saying?	You can stop. I will go on alone.
You are cold.	You're damn right I am.
What?	Nothing.
Hello# hello. How are you this morning?	Do they talk?!
Oh, you're pretty#	I gave you a baby last night.
They are beautiful.	Yes, they are.
It'll tell you pretty much everything about us#	This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
This is yours#	If you want to keep it, you can.
How long will it take you to get home?	Many, many days and nights#
There.	Where?
Well#	I must go.
I love you.	I'm never going to see you again, am I?
Tell the baby about me.	I will.
Help me!!	You could have killed us both!!
Jesus Christ!! You crazy people#	Call the police!!
Help me!!!	Hey, she doesn't want to go with you. Come on.
Oh God, man# don't shoot me# My mistake# I'm sorry#	He doesn't understand# just walk away#
I told you I'm looking for someone.	In the cars, too?!
They after you?	What? No, of course not.
I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you.	Don't worry. I'll be all right.
Tell him I'm not here.	I did.
They're gonna let some local cop blow him away.	Save us all a lot of trouble.
This has always been my favorite time of day.	Very beautiful country up here#
There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then#	Wait'll you see it.
Oh, Jesus.	We better get it into the box. Come on#
Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a living?	I don't understand.
Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?	Watch and see.
I don't feel anything.  Is it on?	Forget it's there.
I understand.  No, I'm not.	You understand?  Attorney!  Right? Am I right?
Jesus.	Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
You just did.	Jesus!
Picture it# I feel like I gotta share this with somebody.  It's too perfect.	I won't say anything.
About what?	That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it?
What the fuck are you doing?	Coming with you.
Are we having a bad night?	Let's talk in the car.
I need my case.  It's still in the back.	Get it.
Forget her.	She still loves me.
What's that?  Present from Faith?	No idea.
And gives it to you.	Wants to share.
Where we going?	Anywhere.  We'll talk about it in the car.
What is it?	This tie doesn't go with blue!
Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.	She wanted to go out to my car, something about my car#
Are you out of your fucking mind?!	Fire's out, isn't it?
Those two guys were cops.	You sure?
Tell me.	I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance.	You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
Got your ticket?	No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.
Take it to him.	A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!
Oh boy.  What if you're wrong?	Then we'll be right where we are now.
Are we under arrest?	Naw.  They just have to ask us a few questions# for about six hours.
Was this him?	Um# he was older.
The room key's in the car. On the seat.	And it's getting dark. I'm not going to run this into the night.  Eddie, we're walking in. Everything covered?
You have the body?	She's buried.
Jesus.	Hi. What's in the case?
What are you#?	Fucking. I'm talking about fucking, Harold. You ever think of fucking other women?
Look, mister#	Take a look, Harold. Tell me if you see anything you want. You do like to look, don't you?
My God.	Not bad, huh?
Calm down, Harold.  Okay, here's what we're going to do, Harold: there's a pull off up ahead, we're going to stop there.	Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.
I've been looking for you.	Why me? What do you want from me!?
There was a car in the lot when we closed. Gone today.	What kind?
I think I talked to him.	Who?
You are so fucked up.	Suspect Zero, now there's an idea that doesn't look good on paper --
I haven't changed anything.  Damn.	I#
Is he dead?	Yeah.
Was it Zero?	Yeah.
I've been to Chicago.	[Not this way. Call it a little favor, call it a little thing I'm going to do for you. I'm going to make Chicago come alive for you. You'll owe me one.]
Don't do it, Mike.	Shut up.
Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off?	You're money, baby.
How are you ladies doing this evening?	What do you drive?
Thanks.	I've seen you somewhere# Where have I seen you?
Hi.	Hi.
Charles! What's up, man?	Oh. You know.
#and boy does it hurt when they ask.	I don't even tell them about anything I'm close on anymore#
Hi.	My pleasure.
Let me just check on my boy.	Don't worry. He's in good hands.
Oh my God.	Did you get it?
The poor thing. Six years?	#And she's with someone else.
He's so sweet. He really said that?	I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.
On the table.	Sorry?
You're not allowed to hand me money, sir. You'll have to lay it on the table if you want me to change it.	Oh# right.
Sorry, it's just that#	I understand.
Well# This is it.	Listen. I had a great time.
Well, I should be getting#	#It's really getting late.
Can I give you a ride to your car#?	#Nah. I'm right across the street#
Hello?	Hi, Mike?
Hi. Sorry about that.	You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back.
How's it going? It's been a while#	#Six months.
Hi.	I heard you might be moving back#
And what if I don't want to give up on her?	You don't call.
The only reason I mentioned her at all is to say that I'm not going to talk about her anymore. I thought you'd appreciate that.	I do. Good for you, man.
So, if the party starts at eight, why are we first going to a bar at ten?	To get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.
Thanks, man.	No problem, buddy. You eat anything today?
You want to talk about it?	What's the point?
I think I'm gonna move Back East.	Well, that's dumb.
You miss the pain?	#for the same reason you miss her. You lived with it so long.
By the way, the guys back home said she put on some weight.	You always know the right thing to say.
Who threw this party, anyway?	Damned if I know#
How's it going for you two?	Not well.
She was cute.	She didn't like me# I made a fool of myself#
He's a bitch. He ain't gonna do nothing.	You asshole.
I'm so sorry, man. You were so right. I got rid of the gun	What are they doing here?
Good for you, man. He's being smart.	She's really special, guys.
I can't lose more than a hundred.	Just bring your card. Half an hour.
Vegas, baby!	Vegas!
Vegas.	Vegas.
That's where we make our scene.	You think they're watching?
Double down.	What?!?
I'm telling you, baby, you always double down on an eleven.	Yeah? Well obviously not always!
What an asshole.	That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
No, man. I need to use the phone.	What?
She asked me what I was thinking about? What should I have done? Lie?	You didn't have to get into it, baby.
No.	Yeah.
What time's this party tonight?	It starts at eight#
Who? Rob?	Yeah. You met him once.
#Maybe. I mean you gotta hide all the lights#	#It looked money.
How you guys doing?	It's on.
What are you doing?	What?
Was I money?	I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
You're not just, like, fucking with me?	No, baby!
How long do I wait to call?	A day.
So, two days?	Yeah. I guess you could call it that.
It's not like that#	Don't give me that! She liked you, man.
Guys# Guys# I got it under control.	Oh. He's got it under control#
Because he's a bitch.	That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit.
Oh, it's on, baby#	#It's on.
Is she looking at me, baby?	No.
Yes she did.	Damn. Now I gotta go in early.
That was pretty cold, dude.	What was cold about it?
It's on.	You think?
Baby, don't talk that way, baby#	You are so money, and you don't even know it#
#Tomorrow, then a day.	#Yeah.
Laugh all you want, but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby who's ready to party.	Don't listen to him. You call whenever it feels right to you.
#Sue#	Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
It's on#	#it's on.
It's on.	#it's definitely on.
It is on.	#it is so on.
No.  You ask for too much.	I ask for Justice.
Be my friend.	Good.  From me you'll get Justice.
Understood.  I just wish I was doing more to help out.	I'll come to you when I need you.
The food is on the table.	I'm not hungry yet.
You heard about your father?	Yeah.
Outside.	Sure.
I'll think about it.	Drive while you thinking; I wanna get to the City this month!
You think we'll go for that last place?	Maybe, or you gotta know now.
You take care of your family?	Sure.
Is it necessary?	You understand him better than anyone.
It is Johnny.  He came all the way from California to be at the wedding.	Should I bring him in.
Will your girl friend get back to the city all right?	Tom said he'd take care of it.
Have you thought about a wife?  A family?	No.
I told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.	How did you find out?
Your wife and children#you're happy with them?	Yes.
You tell us about America.	How do you know I come from America?
You look wonderful, kid; really wonderful.  That doctor did some job on your face.	You look good, too.
Ever seen anything like that before?	No.
Who are those girls?	That's for you to find out.
The old man wants you; Johnny's here#he's got a problem.	Okay.  One minute.
Jesus, I don't know#	Can you do it Mike?
What was that?	An accident.  No one was hurt.
Will you give this letter to Michael.	Mama, no.
Sonny was hot for my deal, right? You know it's the smart thing to do, too.  I want you to talk Sonny into it.	Sonny will come after you with everything he's got.
Sure.  Anything I can do for you.	No.  I guess I'll see you Christmas. Everyone's going to be out at Long Beach, right?
Michael, what are those men doing?	They're waiting to see my father.
I never know when you're telling me the truth.	I told you you wouldn't like him.
If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?	My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid, so my father took him in.  He's a good lawyer.
Michael?	I'm thinking about it.
I can't#	Please say it.
When will I see you again?	Goodbye.
Your sister wants to ask you something.	Let HER ask.
Michael, it's not true.  Please tell me.	Don't ask me.
Where are you going?	To the city.
What is it?	Is it all right if I go to the bathroom?
Mike, good to see you.  Got everything you want?	Thanks.
Yeah.	Do you recognize my voice?
It'll just be for a little while. He can be# he makes me laugh.	Okay, darling.
I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?	You're doing great. We'll make a sailor of you yet. You're doing really well.
Shoes too?	You said I could pick out a jacket and I just# Sorry.
She was pregnant. Did you know that? Do you know what that means in a place like this?	I'm prepared to take the blame.
I wanted to tell you my plan.	So tell me.
That ring's so great. The green one.	Tom, I love you!  See!  I bought it for him, for his birthday.
Are you okay?	Sure.
Very.	And you, sir? Any better?
I told you. He gave them to me.	Why? When?
So you found Peter#	I think we sort of found each other.
What's your secret?	Excuse me?
Show me the other one again.  I like them both.	I'll take them both.
C'mon, I need to talk to you. Just the two of us.	Okay then, you're crazy.
Will we see you later?	I can't later.
Not guilty.	I'll fix some drinks.
Are you okay?	I'm fine.
Tom, are you okay?	You try. You try talking to her.
Ask me what I want to change about this moment.	What do you want to change about this moment?
How was it?	Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.
Can we go up? Do you mind?	Of course. What happened to your face?
You like ball games?	Huh?
You didn't have to spend your money -- ?	He'll, what else can I do with it all?
Damn.	What's wrong?
Where are you going?	I'm leaving.
These are not the kind of movies I go to.	Well, I don't follow movies too much#
What about the record?	Keep it.
Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere.	With who?
Try holding the match like this.	This is gotta be a game, right?
Yeah.	Could you see anything?
Sure. What do you think? She wanted to get out of the cab. I said "Look, you're in the middle of the fucking bridge#"	You said that?
Hello.	You looking for some action?
What's your name?	Easy.
Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?	Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
Listen#	Don't you want to make it?  Can't you make it?
Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!	You can do it in my mouth.
Do you understand why I came here?	I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.
Well, I tried.	I understand, mister. It means something, really.
Sure you don't want to come with me?	I can't. Otherwise, I would.
Are you a Secret Service Man?	Why do you ask?
Who?	Oh, lots. I don't know where they all are now. There used to be one standing over there. 
Is it hard to get to be a Secret Service Man?	Why?
Get it.	Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here. This don't make any sense.
What's the action around?	Slow.
Had a close one.	You want to talk about it?
Not really.	You know how I feel about what you do.
Don't stop#  do no stop.	Shit, shit, shit what time is it.  Hello.  I'll be downstairs in ten minutes.
He says he's leaving the island sir.	Don't let him do that.
I'll go.	Wrong.
Surprise, surprise.	I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break.
Hi.	Hi.
This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he?	Oh, yes.  Yes, he was.
You'll stand by me?	Whatever happens.
Did you bring along something to read?	Damn#
How'd it go?	Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
I think  it's worse  now.	That always used to work.
Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him in?  I'll be right down.	Honey, I# I can't# it's the#
Besides, Daddy's still trying to figure out how to get his new television set working.	I had it, a minute ago#
Do you# remember me?	I've seen you before.  Your picture#
What.	No, I# I just wondering where you've been all this time.
You can all go home, now.  He's not going anywhere.	Go on home, folks.  And thanks for the welcome.
City hall?	You must not remember anything. Come on.
You first.	Why me?
So, you're really gonna be a lawyer?	And why not?
What was that?	Nothing.  
No# you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before#	Oh#
This is strange.  Do you feel it?	What?
When did you start smoking?	I don't smoke?
Your dancing's very good.	Thanks.
What# do you remember?	Well# everything.  It started coming back a couple of days ago. I remember everything now.
Here we are.	Well, son, you're home!
Well, no, but these gentlemen would like to get some answers#	I don't know what else to tell you. I wasn't hiding out.  I hit my head and I didn't remember anything until a few days ago.
Excuse me# what's your, um, your name?	Harry, son.  Harry.
Wait'll you see the inside!	Can't wait.
We've been closed for a while.	Ah.
They couldn't wait to see you.	Who# are they?
Um# Harry?  Did I ever keep the books here?	No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.
Well#	Yes?
Why don't you two get out there and dance?	Oh, no, I#
Beautiful, wasn't it?	Yes.
Jesus#	The film broke#
I'm here.	Did you# did you#
Thanks, Jerry.  Tell me something.	What.
Nope.  Can't.  We're through.	Then I'll call you a cab.
Any idea how you got here, son?	No, sir.
Here, one of mine.	Thanks.
# sorry 'bout that, but you do look familiar to me.	Wish I could say the same thing.
You kids off to the dance?	Aren't you coming?
You smell gas?	Don't smell nothin'.  He must not be dead in here.
You think he's drunk somewhere?	Wouldn't blame him if he was.
Here's three months rent, and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place.  Now, I need a moment alone.	Huh?
Cigarette?	No thanks.
When'd you quit smoking?	Luke didn't smoke.
Her name was right there in front of them.  They gave it to me, I didn't give it to them.	Well, that's not what they think.
That was beautiful.	I taught you that.
Sit.  Play with me.	No, I#
Luke!  Luke, something's wrong! The film broke, and I can't raise Harry on the house phone!	What?
Found me.	Yeah.  I hope you don't mind.  I didn't know anyone lived here# well, besides Harry.  And me.
Please, sit.	Thanks.
I'm# I'm not Luke.  Luke is dead. He died in the war.  He's not coming back, and I'm not him.  I don't even belong here.  This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is.  An accident.	Oh#
What happened?	What exactly did you hear?
I suppose.  Thanks.	You look familiar, fella.  What's your name?
You hungry, son?	Yes.  Very.
Oh, hi!  Did you find her all right?	Yes, I did.
I was wondering#	Yes?
Or would you rather I changed the subject?	I think so.
Do you think I should go?	That's up to you.
Is anyone there?	Look.
Yes, I did.	Just listen to them!
Mother!	If your father were here#
They're beautiful! They're just what I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? I can't tell which is which.	Well, I suppose#
Is smoking fun?	Oh, I suppose so.
Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?	She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
Good morning.	Morning.
Do you know him?	Yep.
I wonder if you could tell me#	Yep?
Are you sure?	Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
How much for the phone calls?	It's nothing.
What good'll that do? Smoke's as bad as birds.	Birds are not bad!
I can handle it.	I know you can.  But I'd like to.
That's the last of it.	Did you close the door?
I wonder if you could help me.	What?
So you came up to see Annie, huh?	Yes.
After all, you did go to the trouble of bringing up those birds.	I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly#
Yes, but#	You are, aren't you?
With# with Annie, of course.	Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?
Why did he shoot her?	He was watching a ball game on television.
You'll be able to find your way back, won't you?	Oh, yes.
I'd still like to see you.	Why?
Are you all right?	Yes.
Some cream?	I'll get it.
It's so damn quiet out there.	It was like that yesterday.
I think it's safe to get out now.	Don't let's take any chances.
The town looks clear.	The bay doesn't.
I keep thinking of Annie. 	It# it doesn't look very different, does it? A little smoke over the town, but otherwise#
Do you want to try your father again? 	I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
When will they stop?	I thought they'd have stopped by now.
Can we turn back?	I# I don't think so. If we get through town, I think we'll be all right.
I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?	Well, all right, but#
There we are!	Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
That# that# who was that?	I have no idea.
I only know we've got to drive them away from town -- before they drive us away.	How?
How do you plan to do that?	With smoke.
Birds?	Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.	Then let's go. Now!
I'm leaving! Are you coming?	All right, all right!  Hope you figure this out, folks.
I fear he may have to.	But can't you give me any idea?
You asked to see me, ma'am?	I want you to help my little girl.
You have his promise, then?	Yes.
He's not home.	Where can I find him?
Where shall we put it? In the back?	No room there. We'll have to set it between us.
This is not a woman!	It was a woman when we put her in.
Are you a doctor, too?	Not yet.
Aye, but I still wonder how much.	I want it --
I thought this was a school day.	I am not at the school anymore. I left last night.
I will not have you use that name to me.	You will not have it?
Can anyone hear what we say?	Only Brother.
I hate that picture.	Where are they?
around, or whatever the hell you're doing here.  What are you doing here?	I'm looking for my friends.
How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?	You sent them. I had no choice.
Two down. Two to go.	"Down?" Wait, don't tell me.
Where is it? This place?	I think we should get some support?
You lied at my trial.	I don't know you, man.
Wrong. Answer.	Who are you?
What did they give you?	They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."
Are you out of your fucking mind? We're going to die.	How can you die if you're already dead?
I was a friend of your sister's.	I know her friends.
Yeah, no kidding.	Your father gave them to both of you.
I know who you are.  That's why you paint your face. To hide.	I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
This is where it happened. Right over here.	Yeah, I know.
This tree. Here's where it happened.	I don't want to see!
It's ok, it's ok#	It's not. I can't take it.
Just don't believe everything you see.	Doubt is a motherfucker.
Why are there so many?	Just hold on to me.
You're in with them.	It's not what you think.
They killed her because she found out.	About you.
Sweetheart#	Don't call me that! Don't call me anything!
Bet he is, Mom. Bet he's out looking for that space man.	I think we've all been hearing too much about "space men."
Can I help you look for the space man? Can I?  I know what he looks like! He's got a square head -- and, three great big eyes!	That's enough, Bobby. I think it's time you went to bed.
Go to bed, darling. You can finish that in the morning.	Okay.
Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?	I couldn't go to sleep, Mom. I had to tell you!
He gave these to you?	Well, not exactly. I gave him two dollars.
Are you an FBI man?	No -- I'm afraid not.
Bobby -- who's the greatest man in America today?	Gee -- I don't know# The space man, I guess.
Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he could knock down a whole building.	I shouldn't be at all surprised.
Go to the movies.	All right.
I've got some money. My mother gave me two dollars.	No -- I want to take you to the movies.  Do you think they'd accept these?
Aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story.	We'll finish it tomorrow# Goodnight, Bobby.
Good afternoon.  I'm glad to see you up and around.	Thank you# Have you any news?
Hello--	You ready?
He's not there.  But look what I found in his room	Is it real?
Tom -- I've been trying to get you all afternoon--	Come on in.
You'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers.	I feel different right now.
Oh -- hello--	May I see you for a minute?
I saw Bobby this morning before he went to school--	Yes--?
What is it you want?	Before I ask you to be honest with me, perhaps I should be completely honest with you--
What happened?	What time is it?
Just twelve.	We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
No, wait a minute -- there's someone else.	Who?
Hello.	I -- I thought you were--
We'll miss you very much -- Bobby and I.  He won't have anyone to play with.	He'll have you -- and Tom.
Is it worth anything?	I have never seen such a stone. Will you please tell me where it came from?
You sure about that?	Would you like to sell it?
Oh, I see. He was having trouble and you were helping him out.	That's right.
Okay -- book him and get him fixed up.  Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.	They would have killed this man?
All day.	Can't stand light?
Why not?	He's my brother.
All together?	Zero.
They're looking at us.	They're gonna book us.
Good.	That's just the way we like it.
Where is she?!	Hey, take it easy.
What is this, David?	You're one of us, now -- aren't you?
Where you going?	For a ride.
C'mon, Michael.  I want to go.	No.  Stick around.
Look.	You're almost one of us now, Michael.
You can't kill me, Star.	I will, David!
Oh, no#	What?
Of course not!	If you're telling the truth, it means we can save you.
I said, I'll take you there. Nobody's going near Star without me.	Okay, okay.
Don't go out there!  Stop him!	Sam, don't --
Smells good.  When do we eat?	I told Max eight o'clock.
You didn't tell David?	No.  Just you.
You like Michael.	I like Michael.
Still mad at me?	For what.
See you later.	I get off in another twenty minutes.  I thought maybe we'd all get a bite together.
Michael, are you still in bed?	No.  I'm up.
Okay?	Okay.
Sure.	Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
-- If there's a girl, we could talk about her.	I'm tired now.
Max is coming for dinner, Michael. I'd like you to meet him.	Can't.  Got plans of my own.
We're getting close#	What's that smell?
Tell them to get something to eat.	I thought we were poor.
Help me, Mom.  Help.	Soon.
He met a girl.	I guess no one cares what I got a job.
Sam.  Is everything all right?	Mom.  I think we've got to have a long talk about something?
Where's Michael?	He's already gone to bed.
Can I sleep in here with you tonight?	In here?
Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.	I hope so.
Are you following me?	Well, I#
Well# yeah.  Sure.	Okay.  Talk.
What's your name?	Star.
Are you hungry?  Wanna get something to eat?	Okay.
I have to talk to you.  Please wake up.	Have to sleep.  Have to sleep, Michael.
I have to talk to you.  Can I come up?	Okay.
David's looking for me# I have to go.	You're not going anywhere#  Sam#
It's gone.  I feel it!	So do I!
This room is mine.	I was here first.
You're beautiful.	Wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face.
Where are we going?	Nowhere.
Mom's home?#	No.  On the phone.
Michael?	Don't turn on the light.
We've got to stick together, Sam. You've got to help me.	What about Mom?
Star.	Don't kill anybody until we get back to you#
Michael!  Get behind the wheel.	Huh?#
What do you want from us?	Just listen.
Maybe dinner.	Dogs don't eat each other.
That night?	Yeah.
What the hell you looking at me like that for?	Nothing.  Nothing at all.
Look, I know it's hard to believe#	So what's our problem?
# It could have gotten to somebody#	Anybody sick?
What you doin'?	Nobody's getting in here.  You can tell them all that!
How you doin', old boy?	I don't know who to trust.
What?	Don't walk behind me.
Somebody broke in.	Now who'd go and do#
We got to burn 'em.	Now hold on, you dumb#
Let's open it.	Hell no.
I said where?  Where'd you go?!	Was dark# find a light#
Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!	Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.	That's good enough.
What we going to do?!	How the fuck do I know?!
We found your clothes -- the ones you tried to burn.	What clothes?
Load of bullshit.	We'll see.  Let's try Clark.
I think so.	What do you mean "you think so?"
Maybe we shouldn't make it.	If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
What are you doing?	Could be important work.  Might as well bring it back.
Well, who's got access to it?	I guess I'm the only one.
Would that test have worked?	I think so.
I guess you're okay.	Thank you.
# Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us.	Nothing we can do about that.
How long will it take you to prepare this?	A couple of hours.
I don't see how# when I'm finished I return it right away.	When was the last time you used it?
How many in their party?	Started with six.  There'd be four others left.
Right.  Why not?	What's that?
Hey, man#!	You reach anybody yet?
Put that down!	No.
You're not thinking of going after them, are you?	I am going after them.
How long's it been?	Little over two hours.
What kind of test?	I'm sure a lot of you already know.
Tie up Clark, too.	He's dead.
We're going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood.	What are you going to do?  Drink it?
What is it?	Everything that's been missing.
Maybe it ain't coming.	Then we go after him.
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.	Who else could have used that key?
You hear that?	Hear what?
Now how did you get hurt?	I had an accident.
How can they just go back to work as if nothing happened?	What else can they do?
There's a place that might help# we could try going there.	Where?
No one ever comes here.  My mother told me stories about it late at night.  They tell all the children.	What kind of stories?
I had a friend who came here once. Sort of a dare.	What happened?
I think we should go on by ourselves.	No#
# Well, you wanted to see it.	This is it?
Yes.  Just about here.	But there's nothing here.
Because you'll never die.	Excuse me?
When was his mother taken?	Last night.
So, do we go on?	Yes.
It's what they want you to see.	This is the way in?
What's it all for?	The air# the power.
This has to end.	End#?
What?	Go back to where you came from.  Or die here.
She won't remember you.  None of them will.  You will be forgotten. That is how history works.	A man can change his history.
Now will you go?	No#
I'm tired of running.	Oh, you won't be running for long#
May I help you?	I -- what are you?!
You're late.	Got here as soon as I could.
You promised me flowers.	What?
You know, the moment is rather dying here.	Hold on# I know I have it#
You're late.	Got here as soon as I could.
Alex, what is it?	Holding you# again.
Let's walk through the park#	No# let's walk through the city.
Alex, what is it?	Nothing -- let's just get out of the park.
Alex#?!	Shhh.  Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk, all right?
Let them.	I have something for you#
In the future, we'll be better.	What?
Alex, really# good luck tonight. She's a fine girl, and she's done wonderful things for you.	Oh?
I've been working.	I came by the house every day after the funeral.  And then every week. Then every other month.  Then I stopped coming.  Did you even notice?
Alex, nothing will ever change what happened, but --	That's where you're wrong.  I will change it.
Good night, David.	Good night, Alex.
This# was my home.	His home.
You're up!  You must be feeling better --	Yes#
How long did you travel?	Well it seems like a long time -- but it wasn't really.  It's rather hard to explain.
Yes.	Thank you.
Why?	Why not?
Is he all right?	Just a dream.  You should sleep too.  You're still not well.
I'll take you to your machine tomorrow.	Thank you#
Good night, then.	Good night.
# It was a great city.  The greatest city in the world.	You liked it there.
Yes, sir.	Very good.  Now if you will excuse us for a moment.
Where do they take them?!	We don't know.
What did you do at night?	What's it like where you come from?
I wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she's in for?	For our sake, I hope not.
I don't know what to tell you, sir. He's been gone this whole week.	And you've no idea where he went?
Sir?	I'm glad he's gone.  Maybe he's finally found a place where he can be happy.
You ok?	I'm fine.
I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there.	In where?
Relax.	Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
And what's that?	My business?
Who are you?	I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
Did you know my father?	Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right?
My father used to talk about you.	Oh yeah, what'd he say?
Look here, I don't like you getting in my face and saying this bullshit to me#	That's too bad.
You done with your small talk?	Sure.
This is really happening, isn't it?	[Beat] What do you need me to do?
I need to get this letter to someone.	I can't take you out of here in your condition#
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!	Mom, he just fixed our car.
Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep#	You two ok?
Your mom take anything before this happened?	Yeah, but I don't know what.
I looked it up.	How?
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?	Yeah.
But no one knew until after#	After I#
How long do we have?	I don't know.
Me, too.	Here, drink this. I'll get the heat going.
They're not here.	They're not.
What? What are you thinking?	There're no cars on this street.
I don't know. Maybe that's because this whole thing is a dream. How can you have a street with no cars on it?	I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.
Of course he will. [Beat] What day of the week is it?	It's Sunday.
That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you.	No, he didn't.
Where are we going?	To the hospital.
You gotta stop thinking like that.	Then, where are you going?
I've been ok.	Good. How's your mom?
It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just a cut. We can get it fixed. But we need to get you to the hospital now. How'd you get that?	I fell down. [Beat] But I'm alive.
How you doin'?	I'm doing fine.
And if I didn't want to come?	I guess I'd ask you why.
Why, what would you do?	I could try to#make it stop.
You should be careful. You could be killed if they found you out here.	Believe me, I know.
My God you look exactly like him.	I never knew my father. Did you?
At the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things.	You thought my father was crazy?
How'd he get it?	[Beat] I don't know.
It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?	[Beat] Yeah, it is.
Exactly.	Well# [beat] let me know how your search turns out.
You'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition.	I'll die either way.
What do you mean?	You have no idea what's going on.
Why don't you help me?	Because I don't have time.
I know. I know it all. Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. [Beat] You're in the Jacket right now, aren't you?	How#how do you know?
Can I get some paper and something to write with.	What for?
I'm not gonna let that happen.	You still don't believe me, do you?
I don't know when it'll happen but soon I think, you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up.	What are you talking about?
You know how to get there?	Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
I tried to kill my wife.	Don't you go to jail for that?
What were you talking about the other day?	I wasn't talking about anything.
Oh no, you're pretty young. Your body'll be able to handle a lot more of it than you think#	No. [Beat] I mean I found out while I was in it that my body's gonna be found in four days.
You ever been to jail?	No.
It's worse than war. It's worse than anywhere you've ever been.	I doubt it. [Beat] I don't think prison's so bad you don't want to remember it#
Hey, Mister, you need a ride?	Where are you going?
Can you drive?	Sure.
In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.	[Beat] Thanks.
All right. [Beat] You got somewhere you need to go, Mister?	I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.	You don't have anywhere to stay?
Well, where are you from?	I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
Well, how'd you get here?	[Beat] I was dropped off.
You want a drink?	Sure.
Well, good for you.	[Beat] Why?
You don't think that's crazy?	Maybe. [Beat] Maybe not.
This is a great song.	You remember it?
Hon.	What.
Honey?	Yes, baby?
I've been better.	You girls are in some hot water.
We're both fine.	Good.  You wanna tell me what happened?
Hey.	How are things goin' out there?
No!	You want to come on in?
This is serious, son.  A man is dead.	I know!  I'd tell you if I knew! Goddamn!  I know something happened, or she wouldn't have left.  I'm trying to remember everything!  Find that fucking kid.  He probably knows something.
Is this the guy you saw them with?	It's him.
Good God.	My Lord.
Oh shit.	What's wrong?
Don't.  I'm married.  I don't feel good.  I've been sick.	It's okay.  I'm married, too.
Well, I guess I'd better#	Wait#!  Um, where ya going?
Do you love me?	Christ, sure# yes!
Tell me now.	Call me back.
Hello#	Who is it?
Can I just ask you one other thing?	Maybe.
Hello, Officer.  Is there a problem?	You wanna let me see your license, please?
Is this your car?	Yes.
How much longer is it gonna be?  I'm hungry.	Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.
I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas.	Isn't this fun?
Oh my God.	Get the car.
Shit!  I# I, which way?	West.  Left.
Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.	Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
Did you finish thinking?	I think better when I drive.
Call him?	Call him.  Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
What's wrong with you?	Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?
Drive!  Drive away!	What happened?
Holy shit.	Lemme see the map.
Fill her up.  There's a phone right over there.	Let's get it over with.
Now what?	Now what what?
Can I ask you kind of a weird question?	Yeah.
What?	Nothing.  It's not funny.
I told you to slow down.  Hell, Officer, I told her to slow down.	About how fast was I going?
Sorry!	Sorry!
Ready?	Hit it.
Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.	Are you alright?
I think I've really fucked up.  I think I've got us in a situation where we could both get killed.  Why didn't we just go straight to the police.	You know why.  You already said.
You awake?	You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
Hey.  Where'd you learn to shoot like that?	Texas# You were right about what happened to me there.
You know what's happened, don't you?	What?
How far are we from Mexico?	About two hundred and fifty miles.
Shit!	Did you see that guy?!  He was right in the middle of the road!
Shit!	What?!
Isn't it beautiful?!!	It's grand!
God!  It looks like the Army!	All this for us?
What?  What are you talkin' about?	You know good and damn well what I'm talkin' about.
You women are crazy!	You got that right.
Are you going to apologize or not?	Fuck you.
Hi!	Hi there!  You alright?
Isn't that just my luck -- I get caught for everything.	So you admit it?
I'm asking you to leave.	Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong.  I'm not leaving#
It must be great with a wife like that.	Each day is better than the next.  Have you ever been, you know# in love with someone?
Mary's a babe!	What?
No You mean#?	Uh-huh.
Well then you've got to call her, man.	Fuck calling her. I'm going down there.
Fuck me.  Let's go home.	No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this.
Well? What are you waiting for?	I don't know what to say.
Oh God, I'm fucking nervous. I don't know if I'm ready for this, man.	Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?
Why's that?	I'm usually too tired to be.
Bob, do you remember Mary?	Who?
I got twenty bucks says you're full of shit.	Oh come on, why would I lie?
Very nice.	I'm doing okay.  I gotta get ready for work.
Take it easy, that's Bill.	Tell Bill to get the fuck off!
Well, it was nice meeting you, again.	Same here again.
Don't you want to know my name?	I already know it, Mary.
Fine. Fine.	Here you go.  What's that smell?
Yeah.	Wow. I thought I was the only one.
So#	Yeah# I guess this is it, huh?
Mary ah, forget it.	What?
Fuck!!	Huh# that's strange.
Are you okay?	Not to worry. So# see you tonight, right? Right?
I've got some very, very good news for you, my friend.	Really?  Very, very?
I think your life's about to change.	So you found Mary?
But you know, you shit out a bunch of kids, you're going to put on a few pounds.	So she's married?
Look, uh, I've been thinking about everything you told me.	Good good.
Hey, hey, hey!	Surprised?
Oh Christ# poor dog.	You're a sick man, you know that?
Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?	I don't know what you're talking about.
How many is that?	Four.
You little fuck.	What?
Have you been up all night again?	Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
He's a nice guy, isn't he?	Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?
I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.	Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay.
Oh yeah. Fine.	Thanks a lot, Ted.
Hi, Ted.	Hi, Mary.
Ted, are you okay?	Just a minute.
You asshole, what are you --  Mary! Is that you?	Who's that?
By the way, how's he doing?	He's dead.
Oh. So# what brings you down here?	Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of mine decided to# ah# you know# just# drive down.
I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but the thing is I already have plans. How about tomorrow night?	Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years.  Don't make me wait another day.
Hey.	Hi, Ted.
Sure.	Oh great, I ran out.
We should play some time# I mean, if you can afford to lose some money.	What are you?
It's too bad you don't live down here, Ted.	Yeah?
Ted# you're not that far ahead.	Look, Mary, the truth is# I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.
That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your books.	All right, let's go.
Get out.	Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know --
Mary, I swear I wasn't trying to trick you.	Then what the fuck did you do it for?
Please leave.	Mary, come on#
What what are you doing here?	You forgot your keys!
Ted#?	I# I just want you to be happy, Mary.
Get over here.	Really?
What seems to be the situation here? You shit yourself or something?	I wish.
I, uh# I got it stuck.	You got what stuck?
Charlie, that's mean. Come on in, Ted. Don't listen to Mr. Wise Guy here. He's a joke a minute.	Oh.  Oh, that's a good one.
Now I've seen it all. What the hell were you thinking?	I wasn't trying --
Hey.	So what's up?
Good.	Where the hell are you?
Well, I'm not.	Then you'll call, right?
He gets it, but he's pissed.	That's all well and good, but what do we say to 'em?
My father --	-- I'm just trying to make a point. This idea is that fucking bad.
We're getting everyone together as fast as we can.	What does the letter say?
We gave so much to get here. I don't know. Sometimes I think what the hell did we do it for?	Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else.
Slow down. Smell that?	Smoke.
The sun came up today.	Yeah.
I saw you out there. You want him to call you back, need you.	No. I'm glad I'm home.
How's my favorite President?	Busy. But you've got his heart.
I guess you won't be coming home tonight.	I, uh#
Get back out there, kid. Remember to hit 'em hard.	What about you? Where are you going?
I was eating that.	No you weren't.
Should be here any minute.	Good.
Bob. Bet you had a late night.	Sleep is for the weak, Mr. President.
Hey.	Hey. Nice tie.
Yeah.	You're my hero, Carl.
Mr. Clear Moon.	Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here.
What are you doing?	James Looks Twice?
I didn't know him, Sir. He passed away when I was six.	Seven.
Somebody was serious about doing this guy, that's for sure.	Ray.
I did.	Who the fuck is he?
Couldn't sleep.	Good.
Jesus, you alright?	Yeah. I# I fell asleep. I can't believe it. I --
Ray#	Let the press through.
What are you --	Watch out!
He sent me to find ya. He says he's got information.	Let's go.
What did he say?	He said he doesn't know.
What was he saying?	Why should I tell you.
The old man? He's gonna tell you who killed Leo?	Go catch Jimmy, Ray. Really. He's gettin' away. Go ahead, go get him. I'm late.
He's gone.	He hasn't left this place in twenty years. They got him.
You're the Indian FBI.	That's right. Turn around.
Get up out of the chair, Richard.	What's with you people? Why do ya have to fuck with my head all the time? I came through, man.
No way. No fuckin' way.	How the hell do you know?
It isn't?	Well, it is. It is that, too.
I beg your pardon.	No, I beg yours. But I don't think you're right on that.
Two.	Two miles.
The what?	You know. The finger.
It never came up.	You let me make a fool of myself.
I can't.	I thought there was something# That night in the club#
Let's make it at eight.	Make what?
Come on.	Where?
I want it understood.	Anything.
Danger?	. Yeah!
#they say you're alright.	I'm fine.
No.	What do you want?
You don't believe that.	Hardly ever.
What do you do when you come here?	I sit. I think. I play games.
Want to play the game?	How does it go?
You didn't mean it. You didn't think. You'd do anything to take it back.	That's three.
One more.	Your watch.
Looks like a tie.	Who's gonna win?
You weren't gonna say goodbye?	I was, later.
Well?	Well what?
Yes sir. I do, Sir.	Well?
Lieutenant# Is there# a Russian attack?	No sir! But you have to be ready.
Yes, Sergeant?	Remember one thing.
Hey, if it was easy, everybody would want to come up here and do it#.. Instead of just us.	You.
If I could fly like you I'd have everything I want. If I could fly at all. I can't fly. I can't fly like that. Nobody can. Whatever it is, you've got it!	Not anymore.
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!	I GOT ONE COMING UP.
Don't WORRY!!!?   You've GOT it!!? Are you CRAZY?	Roger, I've got it.
No! Not again!	What are you talking about, we gotta go!
Is there something I should know?	Just relax.
You're not supposed to#	But I have to!

How much you think?	I don't know#  They're pretty quick#fifteen seconds?
I might have an idea#	We're gonna have to come up with some kind of plan or it's just gonna wait us to death.
I'll bet you're sorry the college ever sent you up here.	Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.
We're not going over there, right?	No.  We go straight.
Where the hell are they?  Hope they didn't wise up.	Nope, there!  That's one.
Why don't his parents ever take him to Vegas with them?	You gotta ask that?

Shut up!  They got wind of something they don't like!	Oh shit!
We'll take your word for it.	Yeah.  Where's your truck?
I don't know.  If this one's any faster than that other one#	I think we wait right here.
You go north, I'll go south.	Right.
You're right, don't matter where they come from.	Right.  We need to be talking about what we're gonna do.
I'm gonna kick his ass!	I'm gonna help you.
I'm making the run to the Cat.	Like hell you are.
Damn it.  What the hell are they doing?  They're up to something.	I don't care what they're doing as long as they're doing it way over there.
They're#they're trying to make us move!	Or just knock us over.  Look, use the bomb!

Twenty.	Okay, ten dollars.
Think it's still following us?	Let's assume that it is.
Ready?	Yeah.  One, two, three#
What's it doing?	Why do you all keep asking me?
It worked!  There they go!	LET'S DO IT!
Gimme back my bottle.	Let go of my hair.
Look, I'm a lawyer and --	-- I don't care who you are. You could've been killed. Every man and woman in here has done hard prison time. And we look out for each other.
Not the whole time, of course. I --	No further questions.
You see that? You wanna be like that?	No. No#
Ten years is a long time.	Look -- I'm tired, I'll see you in the morning, Eddie.
At the trial, you said you were at your apartment that night. Alone.	-- Remember?
Do you have to do that?	"Have to"? No#
So what're we gonna do?	#What do you mean?
-- What?	I've seen this picture before.
Murder witness.	You're doing a murder case?
Eddie# A guilty client's not the end of the world#	EXACTLY!
Eddie# go home. Get some sleep.	I don't need sleep!
My mother find you?	That's right.
No.	"No," what?
#I'm dying out there.	It's okay, Eddie.
I see: He'd walk out next month.	That's right.
No.	No? Then what did he say?
You getting this?	-- Every word.
It's okay. It was always like that.	Shouldn't one of us#?
Look. Mister --	-- Roger --
No# No, go away.	I'm glad you let me talk to you. You used to not let me talk to you.
No.	I want you to kill for me.
Here he comes.	Here he comes.
We can do it right here.	Bobby#
Bobby's got it.	Thanks, Bobby.  And my little round friends, too.
Okay, that's it. I've had enough of the waiting room now.	Oh.
HE'S GONE.	What?
And no one found the ring?	No, sir, we did not.
Where is the ring?	Someone else has it now.
She lived alone.	She must have known someone.
Take a look at this.	She's wearing a ring.
James called me last night looking for you.	When?
Do you want to talk?	No, I want to smoke.
Where are you going?	No place, fast.  And you're not coming.
What are you doing?	Nothing.
Don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever wear my stuff. Never.	Okay, I won't wear your stuff# Why can't I wear your stuff?
I can't remember anything about last night. Is there something I should remember?	No, you should forget about last night.
Nice night.	Yep#  Yes#  It is.
You missed somethin', Ed.	I did? I didn't see anything.
What about James? Can't James help you? You two are so in love.	He's in love with a girl who's dead.  It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry.
Right on time, baby.	Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
Where were you last night? We were supposed to get together. You didn't show up.	You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.
I've got to see you.	Not now.
What the hell is wrong with you?	That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?
Shit, maybe he'll kill you.	What?
Can I take the car?	Sure honey, what's the hurry?
You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.	What were you doing in my room?
Good night, Mom.	Good night, sweetheart.
Let me see.	Dad#
Who was that?	A friend from school.
Dad# Dad# Who was that? How do you know him? He looked familiar. Have I met him?	No, you haven't met him. Have you met him?
Are you sure you're okay?	Yes.
Dad?	Yes.
DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.	NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
What are you doing?	Who am I?
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?	Well, of course, it's always dangerous#
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.	And no one will know the truth.
What are you doing here?	Mickey told me to come back to work.
That's the call that I'm waiting for.	What does it mean?
I did.	Objection.
No further questions.	You may step down.
Anything special about the case?	When she#
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up. Who do you think you are?  Who do you think you are#?	Hold on a second.
I didn't do too well for you.	No, you did fine.
You sure you don't want me to stay on.	No. No. Thank you. You go home.
She getting good care over there?	Actually, yes. It's by no means bad, I#
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much#	Right. Who called?
Yes.	Why?
Thank you#	#that's perfectly all right.
Hi.	Hi. How are you doing?
I've been meaning to come in a long time.	You live in the neighborhood?
Thank you.	You're really#  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?	Yes.
What is it?	Thank you for seeing me.
D'you find an apartment?	Still looking.
The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth? You want another drink?	I think I will.
Would you like me to leave#?  Is this a bad time -- ?	What#?
I've got to work#	Do you want me to go#?
Why don't you get some rest?	I've got to work.
Do you think it's my fault?	Isn't there something you#
And it's over#?	Yes.
Is it over?	No.
Thank you.	I have to talk to you.
We just can't do it anymore.  This is our chance to get away.	I'm going to see you get that chance.
Well, well, well. Huh?	Yeah.
Hi, Mickey#	What the hell do you think you're doing#?  What's going on here#?
I have to talk to you.	What do you want?
Are you out of your mind#?	#I'm going to need your help#
What happened, Joey#?	I can't talk now.
Okay. What do you do when you don't have a witness?	You use their witness.
Are you with me# are you awake#?	Yeah. I'm awake.
What the hell are you doing here?	We got to talk.
What are you doing in New York#?	Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee#
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.	I, what are you talking about? I talked to her this morning, and she said#
We'd be the first to make contact with 'em -- see?	We'd be in all the papers!
Hey, there - open up!	Come on out!  We're friends!
Hurry up!  Jump in!	There was a girl with them#If I could find her#.
You look kinda lost yourself.	But I think I know where she'll be#.
Is that it over there?	Yes#ugly looking, isn't it.
Is that# machine#?	It's gone now.
A big family must be fun#I imagine it makes you feel you belong to something.	It does#Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
How long was I out?	Hours.  I've been so scared#!
Nothing there now.	It was#  #one of them!
Maybe they aren't too sure we're here.	They could be as curious about us as we are about them.
I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried#	You'll be all right with us#.  #for as long as anybody's got!
There's one - there's the other, and we're right between them!	So is the town, I notice!
They don't do much of anything#!	There's a square dance at the social hall this evening.
Must be somebody in there.	Who?  Where d'you think they come from!
Maybe these are not men - not like us.	Everything human don't have to look like you and me#.
What'll we say to 'em?	Welcome to California!
What if it isn't over?	Maybe you should tell me your dream.
Yes.	I'll be there in three hours.
Does he have to stay here over night?	Absolutely.
Someone's coming.	What?
Time for sleep.	Say how they find their way back home.
Tomorrow night.	No.  Tonight.  It's important!
In my bed.	Your bed?
And#what's the man doing?	Trying to get up#trying to get into our world.
Home.	Home, that's right.
What#what is that?	A story?
Yes.  It's a story.  A story for a movie.	Read me some?
You okay?	I'm fine.
I want to see the body.	No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
No, I don't think that at all.  How is he?	They wouldn't let me#
Can I get you something to drink?	Coffee'd be nice.
Did we lose anybody?	Not yet.
Looks like weather.	Yep.
He would have loved this.	Your father?
I'd have liked to have said goodbye.	He knows.
You may not like what you hear.	I can take it.
Everyone aboard young Bill?	Yes, Sir.
Why wasn't I made aware of this Bill?	I didn't know sir.
Carry on.	Yes sir.
There's still a way.	What do you mean?
Make us proud.	Yes sir.
Where's Mom?	I couldn't bring her down here until I knew you were safe.
I thought we'd find a store, get you fixed up and then get you some lunch.  That sound good?	Yeah, sure.
Why don't you go and try some of that on?	Okay.
She isn't that old.	What do you mean?
Yeah.	My old man split along time ago.  It doesn't mean anything.  You just take care of number one that's all that matters.
Where you going?	To take a piss.
You okay?	Yeah.  How'd you do.
I couldn't have done it without you.	Yes you could.  You did.  This is all you.  Nobody else.
Feels different doesn't it?	What?
You know, I never had friends like this.	Me either.
You gonna jump?  Or are you just having a last look?	I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve.
Hey, shut up will ya?	It was a bad dream#
Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move?	Like this!
Why'd you do it?	What's the difference?
Can we talk?	I guess.
Listen man, I think I have a problem.	We all have problems.
Do you have your ticket?	Yes.
Goodbye Mom.  I'll be okay.	I know you will.
Jesus.	I can't watch this.
How ya doing?	Fine.
I feel like I got you into this.	Forget it.
No way!	Come on man, what'd they look like?
So# What happened?	My mother says in this really low, but very awake kind of voice "What?"
What'd you do?	I said "Sorry, wrong room" and walked away.
My parents don't do it anymore.	How do you know?  They might.
Who told you that?	My dad.
That's how he died you know.	Who?
What are they doing?	I can't make it out?
I can't go in there.	What are you talking about.
Remember something, sooner or later# we all have to face it.	Face what?
Uh, huh.	Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
Can't do it.	Sir#?
We'll do our best.  You're welcome to say goodbye.	He's a big boy.
Well, we thought we'd drop in and see if you were all still in one piece.	And, of course, we are.
What?!  What's happening?!!	You're officer of the watch, George.
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus.  Man I knew we shouldn't have gone.  I tried to tell you.  I tried to tell you.  You guys made me come!  You made me come!!	Will you shut up?  You sound like my fucking sister.
Yeah, well you're really gonna have some bad dreams if we find out you didn't.	That's enough.
Me, too.	Why would you do that?
Jesus!  What the hell happened to him.	Lemme go!  Lemme go!!
What's your problem?	Why'd you jump?
Don't ever call me stupid.	Come on, he didn't mean anything.
They tell you that?	I figured it out.
Why, man?	I don't have to listen to this.
I don't.	You will if you wanna eat.  Right George?
What?	If it were only that simple, my young friend.  Read on, gentlemen. Read on.
We've got a problem.	What's that?
How long you been standing there?	Long enough.
What are we supposed to talk about?	You've gotta be kidding?
It's outta here!	Come on man.  Let's just talk about it.
Do you have something to say?	No.
I'm not gonna kill it.	You already have.  Now go on.  Do it.
What's it going to be?	I'm sorry#
No.	What makes you so sure it was one?
Yes, that's true.	Do you think this is funny?  Some kind of joke?  You lost six people out there.
And you didn't do anything about it?	No.  I didn't.
Easy for you to say.	What's that supposed to mean?!
Need a hand?	Thanks, Bobby, 'bout done.
How 'bout a beer?	That'd be fine, Bobby.
Who was that?# Who know's your here?	I'll be damned if that wasn't a wrong number?
Damn it, child! Now look what you made me do.	What I made you do, mama?
I still ain't sure what my daddy looks like.	Like you, sweetheart. You and your daddy got the same mouth, eyes, ears, and nose. Only difference is your color hair is like mine.
I'm scared, mama.	Why, honey?
Sailor?	Yeah?
Sailor!	You up for that?
When she got almost to the top step I stuck my hand between her legs from behind.	Oh, baby. What a bad boy you are!
I really do think it's the best night of my life.	We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.
You think he saw us?	Who knows, baby?
You ready for this?	We'll find out in a hurry.
How much we got left, honey?	Under a hundred.
The world's gettin' worse, I think, Sailor. And it don't sound like there's much we can do about it, neither.	This ain't news, sweetheart. I hate to tell ya.
Oh God, Sailor.	One bad car accident#
She died right in front of me. Why'd she have to go and do that, Sailor?	Let's get outta here, honey.
Not bad for eleven dollars a day.	No radio or TV#
I'm gonna stay here in this room, Sailor. I don't feel so good? This heat makes me tired.	Okay, honey, I'll see you later.
Really, Sailor, it ain't nothin' against you. I love you.	Love you, too.
Mama???	You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER# End of story.
I knew you'd want it again#	That's not why I called.
Thank you.	You're welcome.
So. Is he any good?	No. Not yet he isn't.
That was good.	He heard everything we were saying.
What's this guy's problem?	Just go around him.
Shit.	Back up. Go out the other way.
Wait here. I'll be right back.	Where would we go?
Shut up, James.	So what's the problem?
So -- what do we do now?	Find the jacket.
Want some help with that?	Don't touch it.
Kind of a sign, you're saying.	In a sense.
How are you -- is it Joe?	Jeff. Sorry. I didn't even know this was your house until about an hour ago.
You driving this car?	Excuse me?
I passed out.	You did.
Boy or girl?	As long as it looks like her, I don't care. You know what I'm saying?
You cold, James?	A little.
James.  Don't leave just yet. There's something I think you ought to see.	I'll miss my bus.
Is that really it?	That's really it.
Go ahead.	Really?
Thank you.	You're welcome.
Want me to get that?	Sure.
He didn't give his name.	Who?
Afraid so.	That's a big book you're writing.
How's that?	Well done, James.
She seemed to take it pretty well.	Yeah, well, actually#
The one that left you?	That's right. That one.
It feels really# good# here.	I know. It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning.  Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.
So, why did you take me up there?	I don't know, James. I don't know why I do half the things I do. Who does?  Why do you wear that coat?
You're lying.	The hell I am.
You coming?	In a minute. Get us a table.
Want a bite?	No thanks.
It's because you don't eat.	I eat.
You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?	Okay.
Where you going?	Nowhere. You just sit here and# eat.
Thanks for that. He all right?	I think so# What about you?
So what are you going to do?	Do?
I thought we were going to talk. Last night.	Oh. Well. I#
I uh, I didn't finish, I# fell asleep.	That good, huh?
You go first.	All right. This morning --
Well#	Don't. I know what you're going to say.
Not have it.	No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
He told you.	He told me.
Did you tell Walter?	I told Walter.
You don't deserve me, you know.	I know, but sometimes#
I need a ride.	I'm your man.
He's writing his name in water.	What's that?
Walter?	Yes?
Is it good?	I don't know. It might be#
Who's that guy?	Her husband.
Do you get high, Sam?	Only when I'm working.
Holy shit. Are you serious?	As a heart attack.
What made you pull out that old thing?	I was thinking of you.
Where you stand?	I -- just want to say I'm sorry.
There's so many#	Just a few then. The big ones.
You doing okay?	Got a job at old Frank's place. His son runs it now.
One hundred and twenty feet.	What?
What are you doing?	This little table is one heavy bitch.
I've got some pictures.  Want to see?	No thanks.
I've got some good news.	What's that?
Aren't you glad?	When?
What do you mean?	I mean# feelings.
What are you looking at?	Birds.
I'd love to hear it.	It's a bright sound.
Something like that.	That was terrific.
See anything interesting?	Not yet.
What are you writing in that book?	It's my bird book.
Don't you have friends?	I have friends.
What's up?	Have a seat.
You don't know?	I have no idea.
Okay?	Okay.
Too much sun.	What?
You walked home.	Yes.
You knew her?	What?
You don't know?	Know what?
I'd keep away from him.	What?
People have the right to know.	If she's here tomorrow, I'll fucking kill her.
Yeah, like the bird.	Can I ask how old you are?
Walter.	Do you have many friends?
But will he# ?	Your daddy will always love you.
Walter?	Yes?
No.	I don't mind.
And how's your job?	The job's okay.
Walter, I'd like you to try something for me.	What?
Try it.	No fucking way.
You don't like coming here, do you?	It's okay.
How do you feel about that?	I don't feel anything.
How long is this going to take?	We have a few more minutes.
I don't know.	What did you think would happen?
Walter, we'll pick up here next time.	I want to talk about it now.
You're very late.	Sorry.
When did it all start?	You mean my problem?
Close your eyes.	What?
Who do you see?	I see my sister.
Where is she? What is she doing? How old --	Not so fast.
Don't ever do that again.	All right.
When the two of you held each other. When you were ten or eleven and she was eight or nine. When your parents were out and the two of you were alone# completely alone in that big house.	It was a small house.
She's still really hurt# and angry. I don't know# if she will ever# forgive me. I understand that. I do. I just hope# I just want her to#	Accept you?
It's going to take time, Walter.	Time.
What?	Are you okay?
Want a ride?	I'm all right.
There's something wrong with this picture.	What picture?
You're quiet at work.	I'm just quiet.
Are you?	What do you think?
Something happened to you.	Yeah?
So?	What?
What's the problem?	You think I have a problem?
Tell me about it.	Maybe later.
Hey, there.	Hi.
Why do you want to know?	Because I like you.
What's the worst thing you ever did?	The worst?
Sorry.	What did you do to them?
I never hurt them. Never.	Twelve years in prison?
What was prison like?	You don't really --
I've changed.	Why young girls, Walter?
You know, this is crazy.	What?
Maybe this isn't a good idea.	What?
You're scared.	I'm not scared.
We should live together.	Live together.
It's a bad idea.	I think it's a fucking good idea.
I don't even know how to live with myself.	Just think about it.
What's this?	What's it look like?
Thank you.	You're such an asshole.
Don't be scared, Walter.	I'm not scared.
Don't do that.	Do what?
What's going on?	Nothing.
I didn't sleep well.	Do you want to talk about it?
You okay?	Yeah.
You got it?!  You got it?	Yeah, yeah# yeah.  It's turning.
Deep and slow, big guy.  Deep and slow.  Just breathe easy.	I# they're all dead, Bud.  They're all dead. I thought# some of them# you know#
I think you were worried about me.	That must be it.
What are you still wearing that for?	I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to take it off.
Well, that's that.	Wonderful.  There's some light from somewhere#
Son of a bitch!	Calm down, Bud.
Okay# okay.  We gotta get you out of here.	How?
It is insane.	It's the only way, Bud.  Now trust me.
Hey# big boys don't cry, remember?	Hi, lady.
No, Bud, no# not you.	Who then?
Come on, man.  What else could it be?	Why bring it here?
Is that it?  Is this right?	Yeah!  I mean, I don't know# it looks right.
You better not say you missed that.	Missed what?
SHIT!	Give me that!!
Hey!	Check this out.
But your friend is waiting downstairs.	She'll wait.
How are you?	Fine. Can't you see so yourself?
Anna# Maybe it would be better to wait a while.	Wait for what?
You know, I could just as well go without seeing him today.	What! After giving us such a run around#
And how long will you be away?	Four or five days.
Up until now, Dad, I've been the one who hasn't wanted to marry him.	It's the same thing. Goodbye, dear.
Well?	Well, what?
Somebody must live here!	But Anna wouldn't be staying with the kind of people who live here.
There's nothing much to laugh at.	And that's what I say, too. We could have all been killed.
Shall we go for a swim?	Oh, no# please# not here.  It looks too dangerous.
Twelve years # But why haven't they married?	And why haven't they left each other?
Find anything?	No.
As far as I'm concerned, I think she's alive# Why, even this morning# that business about the shark# it wasn't at all true.	And why do you tell us this only now?
Are you feeling better?	I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.
I think that you might go and have a look yourself.	Yes, maybe that is better.
Have you read it?# They're asking for anyone with information to get in touch with them.	Yes. I had also thought of going there to talk with them#
And you leave me here all alone# in this hotel room#	As soon as you're ready, you can come down and catch up with me. I'll be waiting for you right outside on the square.
But you know it already. Why must I tell you?	So, you wonder why?
Then I'll see you later.	Okay. In a few minutes.
Good night, my love.	Good night. Tell me that you love me.
Who are you talking to?	To the shark.
Please, you come too#	But for what reason should I come there?
What happened?	There's a shark in the area. Don't move from where you are!
I'll stay here also.	But why?# What if it starts to rain?
And what are we going to do now?	We'll try again.
Where is she going?	Ask her.
They tell me you have a lot of trouble at home. Is that right?	Yes, sir. My sister is sick# and my father, too.
We have a radio like this, too.	No, not like this one.
Music, of course. To get a sweetheart, one has to look around, but to get a radio, all you have to do is buy one.	Ah, no# For me, love comes first. I'm a man, and I know what's what: first love, and then music.
Whose boat is that?	What boat?
Because I'm getting fat.	Oh, for Heaven's sake.
You have a lovely voice.	No I don't.
No I'm not.	Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
First thing that comes to your mind?	God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
You want to talk about the baby don't you?	Would you like to talk about it?
You liked Sister Paul?	She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.
It's like hiding from my mother when I was a little girl.	Where did you go?
How would that person get one if they didn't want one?	A mistake#
What did you do?	I'm always bad.
I'm frightened.	Of what?
How did you have a baby?	It came out of me.
What is it?	Someone's following me.
My bed.	What else?
Which one?	I don't know which one 
Who?	Go away, I don't want you here.
She said Michael.	What did she mean?
Are you frightened?	Yes.
It was dead.	It was alive wasn't it?
What did you do?	I put her to sleep.
Here you are. Don't let anyone know where you got them.	Thanks#
Larry#	Marty, what are you doing here?
Thanks. 	If I find anything I'll call you.
???	I don't believe this. I don't bloody believe this.
No, no, no#	I can get you new evidence next week.
Hello, Mama  # brought you something.	Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
Oh that one there, in the corner.	The one up on the third floor?
You hate us don't you?	What?
All right, what do you need.	Answers.
You lied to me	About what?
Like keeping her home from school?	Yes.
And my permission?	I'd like yours too.
May I be present?	Of course.
Stop this, she'll hurt herself  I'm not going to allow this.	NO# no# I said leave her alone.
But how did it happen?	You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
This is permission to take her apart.	Where is she?
Oh, don't do this!	Wasn't it!
Lay them down.	Eh?
They're yours.	They are?
What about all these letters?	Read 'em!
Can you fix him for me?	Yeah.
Sure.	And hurry, they're not looking too happy.
You don't think#	They'll be here.
Sure. .	Ah well. Eh, look!
Oh, there you are!	Oh, I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake.
Well # come on.	Sorry.
What are we waiting for?	Come here.
No, I didn't you did #	Well, what happened?
Sorry.	Eh, there's only three of them.
Are you supposed to be here?	I've got you worried, haven't I?
Oh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time # and who's paying for all this?	It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
No, that's his other one.	That's all right then.
What are you doing there?	Hiding.
Eh # pardon me for asking but who's that little old man?	What little old man?
Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?	Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.
Aye, that's what I'm afraid of!	He's got you worried, then?
Give 'em a pull.	Shall I?
Now get on with it.	We were going to do it.
Hello.	Hello.
Well!	He'll get over it.
I've got the stuff. Come here.	Aren't we #
None for me, then?	Sorry.
Well #	When I tell you to stay put, stay put.
What do you think are you're up to?	Someone put it on me.
Look after him.	But#
Yeah, you want to watch it.	It's not my fault.
He's been gone a long time.	Who?
Good!  Maybe we'll be able to see something then.	Or something will be able to see us.
I got it.  Oh boy.	Where the hell are we?
Can you get it a little closer?	That's what I'm going to do.
I'll go first.	No, you'll follow me.
What is it?	Take a look.
Maybe we can get in by the top.	You want to try?
Can we come up?	No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.
How long to fix?	Hard to say.
He died.	What?
Okay.	That way.
Oh -- God -- oh --	Is it alive?
Oh, no.  Oh, no.	What was that?  What the Christ was that?
Well, uh# good luck.  I hope you won't need me, but if you do, I'm here.	Right.
It's really on there tight.	Here, let me try.
Hey, guess what?	What?
Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on?	Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's huge now.
Where did it come from?	He's the only one that knows that.
It makes me sick to see him like that.	Isn't there some way we can get it off him?
Hey now, what is this?	Ask him.
There.  Should be coming through about there.	Careful, don't get under it!
I'll do it.  The rest of you continue.	I'll come with you.
Now we're in for it.	The door was closed.  It must still be in here.
We've got six hours left.	Oh my God.
It must have stopped moving.  I'm not getting anything.	Let me go first; you stay behind me.
Now what's wrong?	I've completely lost their signal.
Look at that.	What is it -- I can't tell anything --
This is horrible.	Hey!  what about the film?
This should do it.	I should hope so!  And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it.
That way.	You lead.
It's close, real close.	How far?
Air lock?	Who knows?
If we don't hear from him soon, I think we better go in after him.	Sun will be down in a minute.
What is it?	Don't touch him, watch it!
Oh God, oh God no.	Help me -- I'm going to try to get it off.
It won't come -- it's stuck.	What is it?
It's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too.	Let's let the machine work on him.
It's stopped?	Yes, thank heaven.
They're getting pretty close now.	All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door.  Okay?
We do know that.	Yeah?
Oh my God.	Well, it's finally happened.
Martin, uh, we've found it.	Found what?
Find anything we missed?	I don't even know what I'm looking for.
Hey, can you guys hear me?	Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!
I understand why you did that.	Good.
We won't need it then.	All right, so that's what we've got. A week.  It's plenty of time.
Now what?	What do you think?  Now we go in.
Two down, four to go.	What's that supposed to mean?
Kill me#	What did it do to you?
Can I# um# have some water?  Please?	Sure.
Better?	Yeah#
Yeah, it's fine.	God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.
Let's get back and call this in.	Wait a minute.
How many of them are there?	Too many.
Give or take.	We're not gonna make it, are we?
Are you alright?	What?  What's wrong?  What is it?
I found it#	And?
Whoa, wait a minute#	What?
What the hell are you doing?	Hey, fair enough.  If you won't come, I'll handle it myself.
Alright, okay.  Look#	What?
Hold it, hold it#	What's wrong?
What?  Where?	Just behind us, over to the right.
Can't see a thing.  Are you sure?	Yeah, I#
Wait.  Lost it.	How?
Is this the suit?	Uh-huh.
And#?	And, nothing.  They checked out just fine.
Thanks.	Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight.
What is that?	Real man' drink.
Hurry it up.	Don't wait for me!
I'm about to go into the shower, I won't be able to hear you#	I can wait. Where would you like to go? We'll make this a special night#
Hungry?	Just some coffee.
Just like that, eh?	Just like that.
I don't think that's funny.	It wasn't meant to be.
What time?	Almost four.
The mark of a true killer.  Sleep tight, rest easy - and come out fighting#	Why'd call me a killer?
What do you take me for?	I don't know what I take you for anything#
She was a liar, she was a liar!	Answer my question! Weren't you paid to get out of town?
I don't suppose there's a drink left#	You can have one at Max's.
Bill!	Huh?
You've already met.	Where?
Nothing?	Everything# everything's so funny#
It's a good thought.	It won't play.
Thank you.	Nothing, really#
It's all over.	What's all over?
It's obvious you're not a woman.	I've been aware of that for some time.
- little things here and there, it doesn't matter. You can be proud of yourself, you've got a right to be.	Are you proud of me, Bill?
Don't run away, Bill.	From what would I be running?
How do you do, my dear.	Oh, brother.
Kill the people.  Got your key?	See you home#
You all put together?	My back's open.  Did the extra help get here?
It's after one now. You won't get home till all hours.	I don't care if I never get home.
That's the door.	You rest. I'll get it#
If I only knew how#	Try#
Eve# why don't you start at the beginning?	It couldn't possibly interest you.
You're not going, are you?	I think I'd better. It's been - well, I can hardly find the words to say how it's been#
May I have your coat?	Don't bother, I can take it up myself#
Eve# don't cry.	I'm not crying.
I think I know#	Something most important you can do.
A part in a play. You'd do all that - just for a part in a play.	I'd do much more - for a part that good.
She knows enough not to be here.	But not all of it - not that Lloyd and I are going to be married.
If you'd like.	I wouldn't like.
Do you want it on?	It doesn't matter.
What about Bill?	What about Bill?
I remember.	You'll be there, won't you.
Coming?	In a minute#
After all, maybe she just wants to apologize#	I have no possible interest in anything she'd have to say.
You mean - all this time - she'd done nothing but apologize? What'd you say?	Not much.
What's so funny?	Nothing#
How's the new one coming?	The play? All right, I guess#
# and Bill. Especially Bill. Eve did that, too.	You know, she probably means well, after all#
Carl?	Yeah?
All right, what do we know?	Let me lay a little theory on you--
Hey?	Hmm.
What's that?	The fucking New York Times.
--I want you to shut up and listen to me--	--I haven't said anything--
What would you have done?	You asking would I have been one of the President's men?  I would have been.
I think that's him.	Who?
I'll never get out of here in time.	The telephone calls# we know about that.
Hi, it's me. I'm still here.	I'm so glad.
Do you feel much about the things you did?	I didn't do anything wrong.
--you got more than one source?--	--yes--
Speak.	We've just been talking to Young--
--and we got a guy in Justice--	--Deep Throat?--
--it would have been nice to have had this, I sure would have liked to have had this--	--there's nothing new in it--
You've really got to go.	Just let me get a match.
One minute but then--	--right, right, I've got to go.  Why did you lie just then?
--then again, maybe things are even worse than we've written--	--they're worse. That's why I quit.
But they both worked at the White House?	I will not talk about the other two.
I really can't talk now--	--this'll only take one second--
We're going to need lots of good luck, aren't we?	Nobody ever had too much.
Isn't that what you'd expect them to say?	Absolutely.
--no--	--can we use their names?--
--which Young?	Larry Young, a California lawyer--
What the hell was that?	Sorry.
I'll do it.	Okay then.  The rest of you okay with that?
Great evening, isn't it?	Sure.
What did you just say?	Suck me#beautiful?
I had no idea you'd be this good!	Neither did I!
This.  Right now.	Uh-huh.
What do you suppose they're saying?	No idea.
Yeah#so like, what else do you do?	Well the same things you do.  Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever.  What do you think I do?
Nice car.	I'm glad you think so.
Why are you doing this?	Because I want to.
Hi#	How did you know I was here?
My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff#and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off.	That's nice.
What about the game?!	I'm not playing.
Give it to me!  Yes!	Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you.
You're so big!	Yeah, that's right.
Fuck me!  Yes!	Uh#
At least now I know what the hell they're saying.	So, does my hair look better --  like this, or#  like this?
Gotta go.	But --
Did I miss anything?!	Just in time.
But, but -- what would I do?	Anything!  Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no.	Come on, Jim.  Where are you?
Please, God.  Let this be it.	He's going in!
Holy shit.	Holy shit!
How do you know that?	She's already on a plane back home.
No, no that's fine.  So you doing okay?	Yeah.
Can I come in?	Yeah, sure.
Okay.	These are for you.  From father to son.
I know, Dad.	Oh, okay.  Here's let me show you.
Jim?	It's not what it looks like!
#excuse me?!	What, you think I don't know how to get myself off?  Hell, that's what half of band camp is!  Sex ed!
Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do?	Don't you want me to?
You can do that?	Oh -- no way.  I can't do that to her.
I'll just say that we had a great night together.	Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.
It's true.  I mean, after this, everything'll be different.	After getting laid?
Yes.	I thought so.
No#you#go#ahead.	Okay.
You are very good in the world history class, yes?	Me?
James!  You have come in here on purpose?!	Well#uh#
Uh#	Move with the music.
Jim#	Oh no.
Let me know.	Okay, don't stop.
And I want to try to make it up to you.	How?
Like how?	Well, I feel that#things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share#a special moment between them.
Now?!	No#I know the perfect time#
You comfortable?	Yeah, are you?
You sure you're comfortable?	Yeah.  Are you sure?
So, do you want to be -- I mean, how do you want to do it?	I don't know.  How do you?
That was a great night.	Yeah.
You called me to ask me how to get laid?	What was I gonna do, call dad?  I don't even know his number.
Hey.  I got another question for you.	What's that?
#Guess what?	I don't care.
Wow.  You two really have something going, don't you?	I think we're falling in love.
Yeah, but we'll still see each other.	Fuck yeah we will.
Our last game is this Saturday.	No shit.
God, I can't believe there are so many cool people at this party.	Yep.
Here, babe.	Thanks.
Really?	Uh huh.
I don't know if I want to be doing this.	Doing what?
You know.  If we hook up, tomorrow I'll just be some girl you go telling all your friends about.	No way.
Tell you what, we'll jump together.	Sure. We wouldn't ask you to do anything we wouldn't do. Now give me your hand# that's it#
Either way works for us#	But you better hurry.
Ha ha. You were probably right about his mom.	Hope I didn't hurt him too bad.
Face it boyfriend. This is really happening.	No it isn't! You're dead!
Sure. I can follow that.	It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.	Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
I'm serious. There's nothing for you down there. It's dangerous.	Come on. I'm from New York - the "shoot me" state. Don't wait up.
So you came after all. Just in time, it's getting interesting.	You must get out of here. It's not safe.
Don't you want to change?	Man! Our first date and already you're trying to get me to change! You French women work quick!
Hello?	Are you okay?
Holy mother of God#	Fuck me#
Here! Come on! Do it! Go ahead.	What#?
We don't both have to die.	I couldn't do it. Not to you.
I know where he'll go.	Where?
Didn't even have to ask.	All your weapons, on the floor! Now!
No wonder he let her go.	Really.
God. I can't believe it.	What?
Okay. Be careful.	You too.
Oh God. Shit#	Andy#
Pull over! Now!	Shit!
What's the problem?	Hey, I'm new here, what do you want?
Do you think I'm an idiot?	Sure. Don't you?
Ha. Some wonder drug#	Why isn't it doing anything!?
Nothing's happening!	Looks like he lied to you too.
You recognize her?	What?!
We know you were with her.	Oh shit# No#
I always wanted to do that. I saw it in a movie.	What about me?
Andy#	Yeah?
Jesus#	How well did, er, do you know him?
Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell!	No we can't. That's the problem. God knows it would beat hanging around with you!
Alright. Let me write a letter.	Good man. Now can I have my arms back?
Shit. I feel sick.	Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
What've you got?	Just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. I wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.
Well?	Okay. So maybe you were right.
"Together in Paris"! Oh, when can we be "together in Paris?!	When you're older . . .
Are you running away?	No.  I'm running to.
I have to go now, before it gets light.	But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
I was just wondering since we already have the dress. . .	Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . .
Is everyone all right?	I'm fine.
Did I tell you that?	You must have.
Why do you want to go to Paris?	I have my reasons.
Come on up!	Why?
Just what do you think you're doing?!	Trying# to# breathe#
Come on!	No!
You never said anything to me about having to prove I'm a Princess!	You are the Princess.
You said you wouldn't laugh!	It's not you - it's the dress!
It's so beautiful # and sad.	Sad?
I'm so scared#	Don't be
Don't let me go!	I'll never let go!
Who are you, child?	I don't know! I don't want to hurt you#
I've spent my whole life waiting to find you #	And we have found each other nothing will ever change that! I am your family, dear child, but I may not be your home.
What?	Oh my God!  Don't do that # feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here #
Trust me, it's her!	How do you know?
It's her.	He's her?
Well, she certainly has a mind of her own.	Yes. And I hate that in a woman.
See? The Princess is under there #	Ah! Let us begin!
Life is funny, isn't it. You find the right girl # and then you lose her.	What do you mean?
So where will you go?	She found her home. Maybe it's time I found one too!
You are the boy #	I should go
Hey!	What?
Excuse# excuse me, when do I go on?	Who are you?
Hi. Hi, hi.	Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.
Hey, listen, listen.	What?
Look at these guys.	Yeah.
What are you doing?	No, no, no, what# You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.
You're so sure about it.	Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow. I mean, you know, I think that it'll be really nice to meet Mother and Father.
You followed me. I can't believe it!	I didn't follow you!
I'm home!	Oh, yeah? How'd it go?
Happy birthday.	What is this? Is this a# Present?  Are you kidding?
Here's a real present.	What# huh?
Remember, we had that thing.	What thing?
God.	Really? And what is the kick of it? Because I never#
Christ!	Nothing at all?
Yeah, this place is great.	Yeah.
Oh, good. Okay.	I'm cool.
God.	Remember that day?
You look very pretty.	Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
What'd I do?	Step up here!
Oh, I'm sorry!	Don't get upset!
Oh.	Tell him.
Yeah, watch the road!	You'll total the whole car.
Oh.	Look, now, Charlie, give me a big laugh here.
I think he has a little thing for Annie.	Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
Oh, yes, that's right. Did you see the new play?	Oh, you remember her, Annie.
Now, don't let it be so long, now.	No.
Oh. What about?	#of possibly working together.
Oh.	It was a wonderful set.
You're not upset that I brought the dog?	Would it make a difference?
She already has.	It's alright, isn't it?
Honey?	I'll be fine.  Really babe.  Give me a minute.
Why didn't you bring him?	What?
Would you leave us alone right now?	I love her too, Joe.
He's gonna miss his flight.	Yeah.
Take good care of it.	Count on it.
I'm the hired help.	Fuck you.
That for us?	What a nose.  You missed your calling.
What is it?	Let's go upstairs, okay?
You need to call your dad.	Leave us alone right now.
Are you my big brave boy?  Are you my brave hero?	You're crazy baby.  I love you.
I call that a perfect day.	A perfect night.
Go.	Hey!  Would you?
I'm fine, babe.  I'm gonna take a little walk.  I need a minute.  Let's forget it. My life didn't pass in front of my eyes. So, it probably wasn't that close.	Probably not.
We closed.	Fantastic.  Out here.
You're out of your mind.	Just do what I say, alright?
No luck.	Oh, well, we'll just have to try again. Sound like a plan?
I love you.  Most beautiful woman in the world.	Hardly#
What did you get me?	In the morning, after everyone's gone and there's just us.
No.  Did you?	No.  I missed that.
Two minutes.	It's alright.  Be our guests.
Don't be so sure.	Listen to yourself#  Don't worry, it's alright.  We'll find him.  What's wrong with you?
I can't got tonight.  I don't want to be on a plane on my own tonight.	I'll be with you.
No.	Okay.
I know.	Will you make love with me?
Coffee?	Sure.
Something soft.	Right away.  Are you sure you wouldn't like something soft, Ryan?
Are you okay?	I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.
I've never done this before.	Oh?  It's easy.  You just put one foot in front of the other# That's a good girl.
Ryan's really angry with me.	I think he's really angry with me too.
That's very nice.	I like you.
Stop being such a bitch, Sal.	I'm so sorry.
What?	Trust him.
I didn't say a word.	Time!
Jesus Christ.	Well#wow#
How's he doing?	Not good.
Ryan.	I'm sure you understand.
Well, yes, actually.	He always has two or three going#
Are you making an ass of yourself?	There's only you, Ryan.  You know what, Ryan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so much# You need#
Ryan, you've got to come!  You've got to help me find the dog!  I let their dog out.  We need to find the dog.	You're not serious.
Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog!	Don't go in, Ryan.
We could hardly say no.	Oh?
Ryan!	Are you working on a new book?
Is there space here?	Yes.
Shit!	I'd cut off her red wine if I were you.
How's the movie going?  Your movie.  You are making a movie, aren't you?	Yes.  Fine.
Yes.	Well, so glad you decided to come.
You don't need to do that.	I don't mind#
Hey, slow it down, big boy.  You're making the rest of us look bad#How come I haven't seen you around here before?	I'm new#I was born yesterday.
Are you sure this is a real dance?	Well, actually, uh -- I'm sort of making it up --
Uh oh.  Goodbye!  Gotta run!	Wait!  When can I see you again?
What was that thing?	How should I know?
I -- hate -- you.	Well I guess that makes us even.
Water#water#	Water#water -- oh, you already said that.
We're going to die!	Come on -- it's gone!  What are the chances of that happening again?
Sorry, it's been through a war, not to mention everything else#	You held onto this all that time?
May I cut in?	Oh, of course --
#I should?	YES!!!  You know, people ask me, "Doctor, why are you always happy?" And I tell them it's mind over matter.  I don't mind that I don't matter!  Do you get it?  Do you get it?
Wear this.	You're a real buddy.
I'm getting lonely.  Who are you talking to, anyway?	My mother.
This the place?	Yeah.  How much?
You should have stayed in bed this morning.	I should have stayed in bed last night.
I hope everything goes all right.	I hope so.  Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this -- with my cold and everything --  How do I look?
Good night.	Good night.
Well, it was just an idea -- I hate to see a ticket go to waste --	What time does the show go on?
One more?	I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
You all right? What's the matter?	Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
Your phone.	Oh.  Yes?  Just a minute.  If you don't mind -- this is sort of personal
You're in no condition to go anywhere -- except back to bed.	You don't want me here --
Here. How about some breakfast?	No -- I don't want anything.
When are you coming home?	As soon as I can walk.
I didn't mean it that way -- I was just talking to him on the phone -- he's very concerned about you.	He doesn't give a damn about me.
I think I'm going to give it all up.	Give what up?
You sure you want to throw that card?	Sure.
There's a call for you --	For me?
Are you all right?	Sure.  What's that funny smell?
Are you all right?	I'm fine.
Where are you going? BUD Who knows? Another neighborhood -- another town -- another job -- I'm on my own.	That's funny -- so am I.  What did you do with the cards?
You like?  It's all yours.	Mine?
Now you're being bright?	Thank you, sir.
No, no -- just had a little accident.	What does he mean, accident?
On account of me.	You?
Say, why don't we have ourselves a party -- the four of us?	No!
Any of that coffee left?	Sure.
How's the patient?	Oh, I'm fine, Doc.
Where are you moving to?	I don't know. All I know is I got to get out of this place.
Where do we go -- my place or yours?	Might as well go to mine -- everybody else does.
Can I ask you a personal question?	No.
Not so rough, honey.	Good night.
Say, what's going on here, anyway?	Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
Still afraid somebody may see us together?	Let me take that.
I have that date -- remember?	I love you -- remember?
Coming?	You run along -- I want to fix my face.
Sorry it took me so long on the phone. But we're all set.	All set for what?
Where do you live?	I told you -- with my mother.
Did you have a nice Christmas?	Lovely. You were a big help.
You came in on that boat, didn't you?	Yeah --
How about a drink ?	Sure, thanks.
What do you see?	I don't know.
That's a light down there --	Yeah, it is.
Charlie?	Looks that way.
He killed that guy without feeling anything.	Not a thing.
This is evil -- evil, Captain. We're all gonna die here.	Yeah, I know.
Smoke !	Where ?
Careful,  Captain, they've been known to charge.	All right I got a little surprise for you --
What're you trying to say, Captain --	You'll see soon enough -- get going, sailor --
Get in there !	This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party.
Listen.	What is it?
What cat  ?	One that went up for murder -- he was an Army Sergeant.
You didn't like him.	Anyone got a cigarette.
Hey, buddy, that boat still runs, eh?	Yeah, it still runs.
You got a chance in that boat -- by morning you could be five miles down the river.	We ain't goin' down the river.
What -- happened here.	Charlie?
How did they know?	They must have seen the fire.
No, sir.	This gentleman or myself ?
They far enough?	Sure -- fine --
You smell that.  You smell that?	What?
The wind --	What?
I'm waiting for the fucking boat, Colonel.	It'll get here, soldier.
Do you know me?	Yes.
Yeah, I can see that. He's fuckin nuts --	Yeah.
Do you?	Yeah, I like it#
You've gone crazy.	No. My thinking is clear.  But my soul has gone mad.
Gimme water.	No water.
How did we get here?	Because of all the things we do, the thing we do best -- is lie.
You could never figure it because it doesn't make sense.	Fuck no.
Go away -- hide yourself.	What are you doing?
Did you know him very well?	You get to know each other pretty well out there.
What's that?	Just something I read in the Free Press.
He'll kill us.	He can't kill us.  We're on his side.
No -- no, Captain.	Which one's the Colonel's?
The other one --	No -- leave it --
You don't know how happy that makes me, sir.	Why?
Right on -- he's been waiting for --	And shut up.
Who are you?	His name is#
Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there?	No. Not really.
Are you warm, Captain?	The river is beautiful.
So that's it.	You may think what you wish, Captain, but I like you very much.
You came right to it, son of a bitch --	Son of a bitch, sir.
How long have you been up north?	Six months.
You should know something.	I don't want to talk any more.
Stay here.	Be careful -- there're two of them.
Thanks.	I bet you haven't had lunch.
Let's go.	Wait a second.
Be careful, okay?	That's my line.
You're hurt.	Nothing broken.  C'mon, we have to hurry.
Had no choice#  #Given the situation.	I know.  Least you didn't shoot all of them.
I'm not gonna carry you out of here.	That's right.  You're not.
Why in hell you care enough about me to die taking me in?	I don't plan on dying.
Be my guest.	I'm right behind you.
Most dangerous thing in the world: A regular Joe, in over his head.  You trying to prove how tough you are for me, or for yourself?	It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.
Sure love to know where you fit in up here.	I'm here to do my job.
Have to get these wet things off.	You're not going to slow us down! Keep moving!
Told you I'm fine!	How many do you see?
Maybe you can talk sense into your boyfriend.	Shut up!
Relax.  One more day without drink won't kill you.  Right, Sam?	I'm living proof of that sad fact.
You wouldn't shoot anyone#	But I would.
What's wrong?	Just stay out of my face until I'm gone!
I'm too old for this shit.	Any idea who could've done it?
Thought that door was open last night#	Quit fucking around.  Get in.
There's what they're waiting on!	They'll have to come right past us.
What is it you want? What?	I want us to go out.
I'm sorry.	Don't be silly. How bad?
Do you love me?	Uh-huh.
How long has he been having problems?	Since forever.
And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age#  how old are you?	Otherwise, you're not ugly.
What about your mother?	How do you know about my mother?
Sorry, honey#  I'll be right there.	How ya doing?
Yeah, yeah#  any chance you'll get back to work today?	No!!! Stay away from me!
I'm not kidding.	Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
So you'll be at work?	Yes.
Nice of you# thank you.	Thank you.
Oh, I'm sorry# Didn't I say, "what?" I thought I said, "what?"# What?	I want you to go on this trip.
Hello?	Are you still coming?
I was going to do that for you.	It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
Hey -- you let him#	You like sad stories -- you want mine.
Stop asking everyone.	Just him and that's it. Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out.
You wanna dance?	I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
And mean it#	Can we order first?
Well, ah# that's a personal question.	Tell me even if you're scared. Tell me why you wanted me here. It's okay.
Sorry, didn't realize she was right there.  Did you have sex with her?	To hell with sex.
I don't want to hear that music right now.	What do you mean? You said you liked it.
Hello.	Yeah# Well#
Okay to say something now?	Go ahead.
I wasn't asleep!!	What a break#
No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No.	I'm gonna grab you.  I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you.
Do you want to know what happened with my parents?	Yes. I really would.
Good night.	Good night.
We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great.	I just love her.  How're you doing?
But what about#	I'll take care of myself --
One night with me!	You think you're kidding.
I love you#  Let him take you home.	Don't want to. I love you.
I'm sorry that I'm not taking you.	So am I, Frank.
You're taking him#  yes#  you're taking him -- this will clear the books. One night. You want to say "no" to me? Try#  because I've never felt as nuts as I do right this second. I almost want you to try saying "no."	I'm not saying nothing to you.
Hey, where are you going? You can't do this.  I can't take a dog.  Nobody's ever been in here before.	You don't want to mess with me today. I'll figure something else out tomorrow.
What?	"What?" Look at you# You sense a mark.
Yes, we do# And I can give you a tie and jacket.	What?
Actually, I don't think so.	Wait here.
Shall I get her for you?	No, it's all right. I'll just watch.
Is he dead yet?	No! Would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
Did you# do something to him?	Do you realize that I work at him?
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.	Thank you for walking him.
If you'll excuse me I'm not feeling so well.	It smells like shit in here?
Would you leave now, please?	Stupid dog.  I don't get it.
# Now he's going to want to stay. And they'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever. So it's a good five hours back. It gives us a chance to take it easy and#	I'm going back with you.
I told you to go on in.	Look, I've got to get a hold of Frank and see where I'm hanging my hat 'cause#
I think you gotta camp it here#	What are you talking about?
You going to come talk to me or not?	I'm coming.
What's wrong?	I forgot to lock the door.
Is there a problem?	No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
Where you from?	What is this?
What are you doing?	What?
What are you doing?	Get out.  You think I'm running you up?  Get out.
So what happens now?	We go around once.
Okay.	What?  What's okay?
How'd you know?  Just tell me that. How'd you fucking know?	I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.
Five million dollars?	That's right.
Did you see how I did that?  Magic wasn't it?	What?
You think I would be an idiot to pass up five million dollars.	You would be.
Michael?	No.  No.  No.  I don't believe it.
Such language in front of a lady.	I don't give a fuck what you are.  I asked you --
How did he know?	Know what?
I don't know what the fuck you are.	I know.  It was a joke.
Hello, Robert.	The contract?
I know what happened.	I bet you fucking know!
I give a fuck?  I'm done!  I quit! Do you fucking hear me!  I'm fucking gone!	He stole another contract.
Is this how it went, Nick?	Robert?  Robert?
What?	He has to clean up.  How many bodies were there?
Bullshit.	Yeah.
I figure that means these are worth ten times that, maybe more.	Ten million --
Don't tell me I don't have a choice!	Right.
I don't need the money.	This is something that is never going to end.  You can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you. To survive, you have to go into deep hiding.  And that's going to take money, a lot of money.
What I'm trying to say is that -- I'm not sure I can do this, help you, unless I know more about you.	What do you want to know?
No.	Why?
He was# taken.	He was killed.
I killed him.	Why?
It.  Tell it.  For all I know it could be a machine.	You said you didn't trust it.
Hey, where are you?	Thinking.
That's where he'll be.	What?
No.	Why not?
Do you think about the game?	Yes.
I'm kind of tired.  I think I'd like to try and get some sleep.	You can have the bed.  The chair is fine for me.
Do you think he's here?	Here?
What do you think he's doing?	I don't know# But I'm sure he's not sleeping.
Breakfast.	Why don't you bring it out here? It's beautiful out here.
You should knock.	Sorry.
You'll be here.  A restaurant.  A public place far enough away that he won't notice you, but with a good enough view you'll be able to see him when he moves inside.	Okay.  Then what?
What is it?  I don't like this at all.  What is going on here?	I don't know.  It just happened.  I was here ten years ago, I'm here now.  That's it.
What are you doing?	What?
Can I ask you something?	I'm sure you will.
Martin.	Martin.
Four minutes.	What?
Was nice.	Yes.
Hi.  Did you call --	Yes.  Please come in.
Would you like a drink?	I'd love one.  Whatever you're having.
You're very good at this aren't you?	I think you're supposed to answer that question.
Do you ever think about starting over?	All the time.
Is that all you want?	Yes.
Hey, do you mind if I talk a little?  I feel like, I don't know, talking I guess.	Sure.
I think I've heard of you.	It's possible.
Can I ask you something?	Go ahead.
Look at that.  I haven't watched the sun set in a million years. Do you mind?	No.
You wish to close this account today?	That's correct.
What are you having?	A coke, if they have it?
He's not drunk, he's crazy.	Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.
Okay, it's in here somewhere. Let's keep it quiet.	We could make a run for it?
I don't know but that used to be a window and I think that was a door.	Can you do the lock on it?
It must be on the other side of this.	But how did the wall get here?
I'd love to get in there.	Don't we have enough already?
Perfect!	It looks new, they might miss one or two.
Afternoon!	Am I late?
Like a hand?	When your ready Son!
Red or white?	Both, see you later.
My God! What happened?	I fell in love.
It's me you want, I'm responsible for all this.	He's lying! I am.
What about me?	Here!
Yeah, no problem.	We ain't going to give it away this time, are we?
Well, he should be on his way back to his apartment by now.	Do you know the way?
I'm not staying out late and I can't come back to your place.	Whatever!
I don't want to get in trouble.	Don't worry it's okay!
It's not fair, you hardly talked to me tonight.	I'm sorry but it's been a crazy evening. I'm going to make that place into something big. God, I love you!
That's not true, we have a great time together. I've said I'm sorry. Let's forget about it and go stop by my place, so I can get changed.	Oh sure and you will want sex, always sex.
No, I love you, really.	Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
I thought for sure they would catch me.	Thanks.
Will it help to get you out?	I hope so!
I don't understand, it's your home?	There's nothing there for me.
It was a mistake, I never wanted to hurt you, but it had to end sooner or later and now, well now I love someone else.	No, it's not true, you're lying.
Yeah, for sure.	And, since it's only two streets away, I suggest we go take a look. Now!
I'll do my best. Is the place open.	Yep, it's all yours.
There's three thousand and if you don't come through, I'm going throw you clean out of that window. Deal?	Deal!
I thought I'd help out.	We don't need you.
Is it dry?	Yeah seems okay.
What would you like, beer?	No, just a coffee.
I'd better get you to a hospital.	I'll be okay, just get me home.
Don't you have a girlfriend?	Sometimes.
I'd better get going, do you need a hand to get into bed?	Sure!
Did you take your things over to my place?	Uh-huh!
Better than you.	Hmm, I still owe him.
This is your doing?	Yes, they had nothing to do with it.
Why did you break into that particular building?	It was the biggest I could find.
Would you like your things now?	Yeah!
Sure!	Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
Great, let's break for lunch and I'll buy you a beer on the way.	But I have to finish this#.
So, he didn't fire you?	No way, he even gave me back pay.
When the hell did you write that?	Just yesterday.
Yeah, so I hear. Don't you think you should go get changed?	Later.
I think we should be going honey.	What for?
That's my bag.	Go to hell!
Shall I look after the rest?	Don't you dare, I'll be back!
Will you come home and forget all about him?	Yes, if you can get him free.
You are responsible#What has happened?	We're not sure#
So go dance.	With you.
She's coming over here#	Heart be still.
She asleep?	I'll tell her you were here.
Your father dropped off an extra check.	I don't want his money.
You saw him?	We talked. He wanted to get a bite -- after. I said no.
You look nice. I should have dressed.	You're fine like that, Mom.
To see your father?	No. I won't be long.
A late night or an early morning?	Late night.  You?
Have I told you how proud I am of you -- ?	Mom, great. But what I want is for me to be proud of me.
I'm sorry. I didn't know.	I didn't know either.
What are you doing here?	He wants to talk to you.
I'm thinking.	No thinking. The doctor only gives you three seconds to decide --
Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her.	No. Hey. We're sorry, man!
I'm very sorry --	What kind of a man are you, son?
He goes to my father's church. He could've died --	-- This your idea of small talk?
That's deep --	-- Your act only works with an audience.
I know you don't want help.	Then we both know.  I'll point. You drive. Faster.
Yeah.	Why?
What the -- ?!	So you agree you need help?
I'll take a chance.	Go for it.
So what else is on this list?	It's private.
No problem --	And you have to meet my father.
I'll get something for us to drink --	Don't bother!
Because I try to be nice to people?	Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
Do you believe you'll see your mother again?	I hope so.  I think maybe she sees me now.
You're really into God, right?	In ten words or less?
You have to believe to have faith.	You don't believe in anything?
He doesn't trust you.	Sometimes I don't even trust me.
The play's going to be really good.	I'm really glad you think so.
You're not in a very good mood.	You don't miss a thing.
The play's in a couple of weeks.	Yes. And?
Oh. Just not at school#	Yeah --
So it's like you want to be secret friends.	That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
You were great the other night.	Thank you. So were you.
I haven't been nice to you.	You're hardly nice to anyone.
All of it.	It's not.
Okay. Maybe some of that is true --	You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
So you're talking to me?	When I have something to say.
What does that mean?!	It means you can do anything.
Hey.	I heard what you did. Thank you.
Like fire.	What?
Yes. But not as a date date.	Why not?
I can't believe you asked my father's permission.	I wanted this to be a date.
Your turn.	No.
Before we do this.	We're doing something -- ?
Excuse me?	Fun.
Stand right here.	Where?
It's places like this that make me certain there's a God.	You're sometimes not sure?
I don't understand#	Maybe you're not supposed to.
I might do it wrong.	Not possible.
You make me feel#	Loved?
Come on.	Where?
What'd you tell your father?	The truth. I just left you out of it.
When did you build this?	I was twelve.
What's the best thing I can see tonight?	Me.
Are you frightened?	All the time.  I feel like I have no one.
Help me live until I die?	I will.
Nope.	Anything you want.
What are you thinking?	That I want you to take me home.
I've talked to your father.	That's what I mean.
How you doing?	Tired.
How're you doing?	Better. I was really angry.
It's gone now.	Because you have hope that you'll get better?
Can I -- go out?	You'll be fine for a few minutes.
The Carter boy. Tell me about him.	He wants help with his lines --
I'm sorry your mother isn't here to help you become a woman.	Dad, I've become a woman without her. Just not a pretty one.
Did you give him a gift?	No.
I'm asking how much.	Dad --
When Mom died you told me God wanted her more, loved her more --	I was wrong. Nobody could have wanted or loved your mother more than we did. Not even God.
You're in the play?	Lead man.
I care for her.	I don't want to see her hurt.
This week.	Ever again.
It's her decision and she's decided not to tell people -- at least for now.	How -- how long does she have?
You've been well?	Yes. You?
Shall I give you a few ideas?	Please.
No way. No thanks. I can't do it --	-- You can and you will, Mr. Carter.
This# is the number one single?	Yes, sir!
Morning Dick.	Marty. What's for breakfast?
How was school today?	Fine.
Here's your jacket!	Uh, thanks#
Huh?	Have we ever met before?
Hi, Marty.	Uh, hi#.
You remember me#?	How could I forget?  Oh, sure, I remember you.
George! He's supposed to ask you to the dance!	But he didn't ask me.
Hi, Marty!	Listen,  Professor Brown told me you called last night and gave me your message#
Are you all right, Marty? You seem a little#nervous.	Oh, no, I'm fine#fine.
I think I know exactly what you mean.	You do?
Is that what you were going to ask me, George? To go to the dance?	No!
You've gotta ask her to the dance!	Not now#.
I don't want to hit you in the stomach!	You're not gonna hurt me. Just hit me in the stomach.
Yes, that's my name. Who are you, young man? Are you supposed to be here?	Uh -- yeah. I'm new here, and I'm supposed to be in this class.
Been any place unusual in the past twelve hours?	Home, school, here# 
Okay, Martin. You have a good evening now.	Yeah,  Right.
Did you ever consider that some doors are locked for a reason?	Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.
Professor? Professor Brown?	You know me?
Professor. Well, not exactly, Professor. You see, we don't point it at the sun.	We don't#.
I know.	You did what?!?
There's no way of knowing.	Perfect#
Pretty, isn't it?	It's the most beautiful city I've ever seen! What is it?
Sweet and what?  Maybe you'd better pay for this first.	Sure,.
Look, maybe I'd better talk to Dick. Is he around?	Dick? Dick who?
Can you imagine your parents in bed together?	No way!
No# You go in there, I'll have to kill you.	What's going on?
You promise to stay down there for an hour?	Yeah.
Catch!	What do you mean?
What you been doing?	Running this place for a fella in town. Nothing much to speak of.
That's what he told you, huh?	No, he showed me one.
What'd they look like?	Kind of round, like so# Gold. I'll show you if you want.
Sure is pretty.	What'd you come out here for?
You know, before I met her, nobody could ask me how I was doing with my girl. Matter of fact, I didn't really have one.	Is that right?
Hi.	What're you doing?
What for?	For coming onto my property# With a gun.
You still in school?	Nah, I got me a job.
That's my father. I got to run.	Hey, wait a minute. When am I going to see you again?
Well, I know what my daddy's going to say.	What?
Hi.	Well, stop the world.
Can I come around and see you tomorrow?	Okay.
What a nice place.	Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
Somebody else is going to get it.	I don't care.
You know what I think?	What?
I came in the front.	How bad off is he?
Are you sure?	You don't believe me, see for yourself.
Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.	You said that once already# Too late now.
How you doing?	I'm fine. Kind of tired.
Is he upset?	He didn't say anything to me about it.
Think I got 'em?	I don't know.
What'd you put him in there for?	Just to keep him out of the sun.
You tired?	Yeah.
Hey, why're you always walking ahead of me?	Well, why you always walking behind me?
Don't.	Anybody ever done that to you before?
I'd like to get out of here.	Soon as I start the car# and fix my hat.
What?	Nothing# I was just running off at the mouth# as usual.
You know# they'd probably ask to see your driver's license before they hired you.	Well. I'm not going to let that stop me.
Have you got a better idea?	I just don't want to go.
Course it's too bad about your dad.	Yeah.
What's that?	Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
Hi.	Yes?
Good deal# Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?	Stay as long as you like.
You're my friend, aren't you?	Yes.
Morning# Say, you got any gas?	Maybe.
See, we're about out# been driving all night. Actually, I don't even have time to explain it to you.	Well, matter of fact, I don't have any.
You didn't walk out here.	It's mine all right.
Okay, friend. Start running.	Just gimme a chance.
Hi.	Hold it right there.
Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?	I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
Where're you goin'?	To get my guns.
Was she pretty?	Who?
You keep an eye on it.	Any time.
Stay here, I'll be back.	Sure.  I won't hold my breath.
Is, uh# Is he okay?	He will be# When he can't write, he drinks.
Yes, I'm afraid I have.	What are they like? What are they about?
#This'll sometimes help.	That doesn't help anything, Bill.
I write.	Oh yeah? What kind of write?
Yeah, he's funny that way.	I#
Well that's what he said.	What else?
# You got a glass? It's the least I can do.	Okay# a quick one, sure#
#This must be boring you.	Not at all. It's damned interesting.
I hope these are your shoes.	Hi, Charlie.
Jesus, what a day I've had. Ever had one of those days?	Seems like nothing but, lately.
#Okay	Huh?
Big fuckin' deal.	You want my partner to kiss your ass?
He teach you to do it?	You two have some sick sex thing?
Why's it so goddamn hot out here?	#Fred#
Where were you tonight?	Home. Watching TV.
Yeah, I was drinking.	When did you start drinking again?
There's no smoking in this building.	What are you gonna do -- charge me with smoking?
Take care, you hear?	Did you find out about her parents?
So -- how are things?	Things are fine.  I told you. They're fine.
You okay?	Yeah.
What was she like?	Who?
I need a cigarette.	I thought you quit.
What are you talking about, Nick -- what's wrong with you?	Who's got access to my goddamn file?
You did it for me.	Yes.  I care about you.  I did it for you.
What is your problem?  I'm trying to help you.  Why won't you let me help you?	I don't need any help.
You should do something about this lock.	She's evil.  She's brilliant.  Be careful, Nick.
What are you doing here?	Put your hands up!
I'm De#	I know who you are.
How long were you having sex with him?	About a year and a half.
Do you have a cigarette?	I don't smoke.
I told you -- I quit.	It won't last.
Did I miss something?	I told them you wouldn't want an attorney present.
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.	I have nothing to hide.
How did you feel when he died?	I loved him.  I hurt.
Even though you were fucking him.	You still get the pleasure.  Didn't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, Nick?
Sure.	Thanks.
I passed.	You see?  We're both innocent, Nick.
How do you know all this stuff about me?	You know all about me.
Would you like a drink?  I was just going to have one.	No, thanks.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.	I'd like to ask you some, too.
You tell me.	I don't know.  But you do.
Jack Daniel's okay?  It's gonna have to be.	Fine.
Aren't you going to thank me?	What's it about?
Why does he do it?	To see if he can get away with it.
When did you write it?	You mean did I write it before my parents died?
You're not going to stop following me around now just because you're on leave -- are you?	No.
Maybe she saw something she didn't see before.	She's seen everything before.
Did you think it was so special?	I told her it was the fuck of the century.
What did you think?	I thought it was a pretty good beginning.
You shouldn't play this game.	I don't have a choice.
You're in over your head.	I know.
It's OK.  It's OK.	Make love to me.
No.	No?
You won't believe me.	Try me.
Do you believe me?	I don't know.
Can I talk to you a minute?	Honey, why don't you go in the car?  I'll be right there.
You still think I kill people, don't you?	No.
How'd you get in here?	I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
I have to do some research tomorrow.	I'm very good at research.  I'll help you.
I finished my book.	How did it end?
What do you want, Nick?  Flowers? I'll send you some flowers.	What is this -- some kind of# Joke?  Are we playing games again?
How did he die?	He was murdered.
You have the right to an attorney.	Why would I need an attorney?
In the beginning.  Then I got to like what he did for me.	That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?
Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine?	What are you doing here, Pop?
What's goin' down, son?	Nothin'  I'll be okay, pop.
She knows where I live and breathe. She's coming after me.	What is it you got between you?
I don't think it's funny.	Well, hell, son, it's got a certain ring to it, I'll say that.
Easy there, partner -- I wasn't there.	I went over last night, too.
You feeling better?	I feel fine!
I'm not afraid of her.	Why the hell not?
You know that stuff they say about how you can judge people by their friends?	I don't believe it.
Where the hell you goin'?	I'm going with you.
What is all this "Nick" stuff -- Nick would you like a cigarette. Nick can you give me a ride.	She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.
You sure?	I'm sure.
I'll ask you once, Nick -- for the record did you kill him?	No.
Tell me again.  I want to hear you say it again.	It was an accident.
Why do you think he's dead?	You wouldn't be here otherwise, would you?
He died -- about five or six years ago.	He was shot.
Is this finished yet?	I don't know.
I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me.	That's good. At least they're interested.
That was my favorite part!	We can do better. It needed more white.
These are great.	Aren't they?
No.	You haven't been by lately.
When?	How about right now?
Who did this?  Who did this?	I don't know. I told you, this isn't my apartment.
It doesn't matter how much you worked on them. It matters how much you can get for them.	I can get ten.
What is it that gets you out of bed in the morning? 	I hate this. Turn that off.
Paint it out.	Out?
It's Andy again.	Still not here.
Blue? Where?	What's wrong with you today?
We got beat.	For real?
You gonna carry that around all night?	Yeah# I'll paint on it.
I don't really have any problems.	Good. What do you have?
She's good.	I guess it was a long time ago.
Sit down! You're gonna fall out!	Me fall? Let's get some drugs!
No, don't tell me you just got fired by your crazy boss.	I guess you did.
Do you know what he's saying?	What who's saying?
You look fucking beautiful, beautiful.	Well thanks!
It looks done.	Think so?
Hi.	Hi.
Hi.	Hi.
See you later.	Thanks
Come on.	Wanna Mac?
That one's for you.	Thanks# I'll take it tonight.
You don't have any!!!	That's impossible. I've got, like, five of 'em!
I suppose you feel better now, sir.	No, actually I feel worse.
I guess this mean we won.	Yes, I suppose that we did.
How could you?  I'm a woman#	I'm -- sorry, I --
We've met.	Have we?
# Maybe I'll watch it on TV.	"We"?  You and#
# What do we do?	I don't know.  Till we figure it out, let's # let's keep dancing.
Let's make a deal.  Other than my blood, what can I off--	Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.
Son!	Dad!  Save yourself!
I'm sorry.  I was too late.	Too late for what, dear child?
But I can't can I?	No, my boy.  I'm afraid none of us can.
I love you, old man.	Remember this.  And remember it always.  I'm proud of you.  And I love you too, son.
It's good to see you.	What seems to be the problem?
I could have made it, you know.  I didn't need your help.	Whatever you say, lady.  It's all in a day's work for me.
Go on, kill me too.  Just as you killed my wife.	I didn't kill your wife.
Pull back.  You can't make the jump.	I can make it.
And?	Can I get some help over here?
You're not even listening to me.	What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying#
Make a choice, Bruce.  Her or me.	Well#um#her.
Make yourself right at home.	Where is my wife?
Bad luck, I'm afraid.  It's time to die, little bird.	What do you mean?
The dreams again, sir?	I think they're getting worse.
Why do I keep doing this?	Why, indeed?
How are you feeling, young man?	Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
Up here, Al.	Just checking, young sir.
He's home. I sent the signal.	What's wrong?
I haven't had much luck with women#	Maybe you just haven't met the right woman#
I'm surprised you aren't blind by now.	I'm sorry. Who are you?
Like normal folks.	What? This isn't normal?
Find anything interesting?	Why do I feel like the other man, here?
Why do you do that?	What?
Okay. I'm outta here.	Excuse me.
I need to be part of this.	Absolutely not.
I'll show you it works.	What the hell is going on here?
How high up would you say that is?	I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot.	Take me. Let the boy go.
GET IN THE CAR!!	WHICH CAR?
Look! Police!	I know. I called them.
Please.	I won't let you have it.
But it's not fair.  I'm half drunk and you're not even --	I'll take you home if you'd like.
I don't sing very well.	Then there's one thing in the world you don't do very well. And I know what it is -- Now you'll have to kill me.
To tell you the truth, I'd just about given up waiting.	I said I'd call you the minute I got free.  And I did -- And here we are.
I know it's late. I -- Are you there?	Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you.	I feel naked without it.
Keep her on the line!	# Where are you calling from?
Got it!	What now?
We got 'em!	Take 'em! I want his head!
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!!	WHAT?
Boss! Jesus! They've --	They'll be sorry. They'll be sorry. MOVE OUT!
Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal --	JACK?  JACK?  DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK?
I've seen worse.  Much worse.	Strong stomach, huh?  I like that in a woman -- Maybe we can do business after all.
Oh.  Sorry.  I was thinking.	What were you thinking?
HOLY SHIT!!	You okay?
Well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like #	Did you really ask?
Everything's gonna be fine.	About Charles#
Here, let me do that.	No, I'm fine.
Two dollars please.	Annie, it's me.
He doesn't like to say much does he?	Right first time.
Goodnight Annie.	Night.
Say that again, son.	I beg your pardon?
Tomorrow.  You have a problem with that?	No. Perfect.  Looking forward to it. CUT TO:
Well, congratulations.  Isn't that great, David?	Certainly is.
Of course.	And a car.
Honey, calm down now# it's okay#	There's a man.  I woke up next to a man #
Interesting suit.	Why thank you sir.
Huh huh huh. That was cool.	No it wasn't!
Wait, I wanted her to do it.	Huh huh. Soon, she will be mine.
Huh huh huh huh huh huh.	Uh# Uh#
Uh# Hey baby. Are we like, doing it?	Me first?
Huh huh huh. I'm ready for love.	Me first! Me first!
Me first.	Huh huh. No way, dude.
So, like, where is she?	Yeah, really.
That was boring. Huh huh.	Yeah, it's just the same thing over and over again.
Whoa, my life is cool!	Uh# I think I'm seeing something too. It's like a really long time ago#
You got two seconds!	Uh, huh huh. Is that gonna be enough time?
Who sent ya?	Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we could do you. And he was gonna pay us.
Oh no.	It's your turn, darling.
This fire wasn't burning when we left the house.	How's your arm?
You'd better sit down, hon.	I am sitting.
You saved my -- uh -- life# or whatever# something.	Two hours.
She can't see you, right?  In the book, Rule Number Two: the living usually won't see the dead.	Won't?  Or can't?
I guess# if I'm going to be dead, I'll just have to be the best dead person ever!	That's my girl!
Oh, honey, we may need that.	No, I'm not putting up with this.
Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone.	You left me.
That little girl saw us.	She couldn't have.  We can't make them see us.
What happened?	Three times.  Powerful number.
I guess we open it.	Maybe we should knock first?
What is going on?	Really.  I don't know.
Did you get the paint?	I got it.  And I took pictures of the new church for you, too.
Don't say his name!  Just practice. Do it yourself!	And if we need you again, how do we#?
All right.  Who are you?	We're#
-- Like you used to be?	Yes.
No, you don't!  He does not work well with others.	What do you mean?  What's he do?
Tell the truth.	I always tell the truth.  Of course I can see you.
We can't.  We haven't left the house since the funeral.	Funeral.  God, you guys really are dead!  What was it like?  The funeral. Did you cry?
I don't wear that stuff to bed. Besides, there's nothing wrong with it.  I'm getting out of here.	Wait# I don't think it would be a very good idea if you told your parents that we're up here.
I hate you!  I can't trust anybody!	No, wait!
So# You're ready for me now?	You've got to help them.
What?	I'm lonely.
Is the rest of the house as bad as this?	The rest of the house is probably worse.  When can you and I get started?
What's wrong?	I thought I saw something.
You don't have a key?	Maybe Charles does.
What's happening to them?	I don't know.
They don't want to come down.	Why not?
Their wedding clothes.	Their wedding clothes.
You were wrong, it did hurt.	But not for long#
# And please call me Robert.	Yes, Robert. I will.
# Were you going somewhere?	No, Robert.
# It's five of, you'd best get on in there.	Thank you, Robert.
I would like to walk today.	Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
Will you be leaving now, Robert?	In a day or two, yes.
# Do you think we should look for him?	I don't think so, he should be along soon#
We have to find him, Robert - he could be lost, something may have happened, we can't leave him!	You really care for him, don't you, Eve?
I hope you're comfortable.	Yes. I am.
Would you care for a drink?	Yes. Thank you.
I would like to watch television.	Oh? Certainly#
May I ask your name?	My name is Chance.
# Why# No, I don't think so#	That's good.
Can you see well?	Yes, very well, thank you.
Do you need a doctor? I could call Robert#	I don't want Robert.
You must sit with us, my friend, we have much to discuss.	I agree.
We could do it now, we can go upstairs.  # Please, it's time for us. Come upstairs.	I like to watch.
# Did you wish to see someone, sir?	Yes, I would like to see Ben.
Mr. Chance, I'm very pleased to meet you.	Yes.
What about money?	I never needed money.
Some pictures#?	Yes. Of men and women.
I don't think we should call anyone just yet, it may not even be all that serious.	I agree.
How long do we stay in here?	How long? I don't know, see what the doctor says #
What are your plans now, Mr. Chance?	I would like to stay and work in my garden.
No, Thomas. I don't know how to sign.	Come now, Mr. Chance.
Good morning, Mr. President.	# Hello.
Yes. It has.	# You will honor me and my family with a visit, won't you?
Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm out# How are you feeling?	Tired# And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.
Come on, Eve. Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you.	Would you two excuse me for a moment?
# Maybe you should talk to somebody, darling.	No, that won't do any good.
I can certainly understand that#	Of course# I'm so sorry for you, Eve#
# What do you make of all this?	I really don't know, Tom - he seems so honest and simple# In a way, he's quite charming#
Ben!	# Mr. President, how good to see you.
You're right, Mr. President I don't like feeling sorry for myself.	Take care of yourself, Ben.
When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly?	Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thousand times, thank you!	Tell your friends.
Yeah, just an idea I had.	She's very beautiful.
Hi.	Hi.
Did you eat?	Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.
I have to go back.	Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
How was it?	I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.
So how was it? What was he doing?	Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
You were him last night, weren't you?	Yes.
Tell her you need to see her.	You bastard.
My God!	I'm so glad you're safe. You look really wonderful.
Holy shit, yes!	Holy shit, yes!
What?	I just wanted to say i. Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work?
Don't you want to know what happened to me?	No.
This is important!	It better be.
Do you dream often?	Do you?
It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I think I'm going crazy.	I'm sure you're not going crazy.
We have to meet.	One hour.
Can I get you a drink?	Whatever you're having.
Thanks so much for coming over.	Oh, I'm really glad you called.
Darling!	What the fuck is going on?
Shut up!  Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute.	It's okay, my sweet.
Folks came.	Folks come. Folks go.
Well?	Well what?
The Word. What you was put here to speak.	That's the last thing they took from me.
YOU HURT ME.	I WILL PROTECT YOU.
WATCH OUT FOR HER; SHE CAN GIVE YOU DREAMS.	WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
DID YOU COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE.	YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
WILL YOU STAY?	WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?
CAN THEY GET IN HERE?	NO. THEY TRIED ONCE BUT I STOPPED THEM. THEY WON'T EVER COME BACK#YOU MY BEST THING.
You don't sit with me!!	Baby, don't be like that.
I want somethin' sweet.	We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
Your mother all right?	No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day.
Well, if you want my opinion#	I don't. I have my own.
Yes?	May I come in?
Should I wake her?	No, let her rest.
DON'T LOVE HER TOO MUCH.	DO YOU FORGIVE ME?
OUT THERE. WAY OFF.	DADDY IS COMING FOR US.
Morning.	Morning, ma'am.
Mama let me help you.	NO!#She wanted me to do it.
But you didn't come here talking 'bout Paul. You came asking about a new girl.	That's so.
This is hard for me. But I got to do it. Two things I got to say to you. I'm a take the easy one first.	If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
I said I had two things to say to you. I only told you one. I have to tell you the other.	I don't want to know.
Jesus.	It ain't what you think.
What, baby?	She left me. She's gone again.
Not too sweet! You make it too sweet they don't eat it.	Make it the way I always do.
Hey!!	Yes sir.
Fuck.	What do you think?
Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude.	Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john.
This is our concern, Dude.	No, man, nothing is fucked here--
Jesus fucking Christ.	Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago.
Excuse me?	Nothing.
They range up to three thousand.	Yeah, but we're--
Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?	Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed off?
Yeah Walter, what's your point?	Huh?
Jesus, man, can you change the station?	Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
Take it easy, Dude.	Yeah.  Thanks man.
Jeffrey, you haven't gone to the doctor.	No it's fine, really, uh--
Tell me a little about yourself, Jeffrey.	Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.
What's your point, Walter?	There's no fucking reason--here's my point, Dude--there's no fucking reason--
Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it is no dream.	You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
Walter, they're calling the cops, put the piece away.	MARK IT ZERO!
Oh shit.  Walter.	What the fuck is going on there?
That's it.  I'm out of here.	For Christ's sake, Dude.
Who the fuck is that?	Huh?
Walter, if you're there, pick up the fucking phone.  Pick it up, Walter, this is an emergency.  I'm not--	Dude?
Oh, shit.	He can't walk, Walter!
Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you.	Hey, cool it Walter.
What's mine is mine.	Come on, Walter!.
Shit Dude, I'm sorry--	You're a fuck, Walter!
Dude here.	Who is this?
Shut the fuck up.  Hello?	Yeah?
C'mon man, who're you gonna believe? Those guys are--we dropped off the damn money--	WHAT?!
Well?  Aren't you?	Well. . . yeah.
Put me down, you son of a bitch!	Walter!
Yeah, but--	Am I wrong!?
I'm not--	A world of pain.
Walter--	YOU THINK I'M FUCKING AROUND HERE? MARK IT ZERO!!
Two years.	Then they weren't created to go after your "patient zero".
Where to first?	The House of Pain.
What was that?	Nothing.
He's right about one thing.  We do have to survive.	You don't have to hunt to do it.
Each day is a little life.	What?
Anyone else make it?	I don't think so.
Thank you.	For what?
You don't want to go there.	Why?
How does it look?	Not good.
You came back for me.	Did you think I wouldn't?
What do you think?	Sounds like a plan.
Your security's for shit, kid.	Where the hell have you been?
You want me to hunt them for you.	Not alone.
What's going on?	He was here.  Watching us.
We're locked in.	Are you insane?  He'll kill us both!
Get in. Youe leaving.	Wait.
What took you so long?	Don't even start, old man.
Don't try to talk --	Listen. You have to -- finish me off. You don't want me coming back.
Beautiful day, isn't it?	How can you be out here?
You're not going anywhere.	Watch me.
Is something wrong, my friend?	You're blind --
You shouldn't be here.	I'm sorry, I --
How did you know?	Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up.
You can't do this, he's human, it's murder.	It's war, now get the fuck out of the way!
What are you looking at?	What do you see here?
You let him go --  An hour ago you were ready to kill a man for less, this one didn't even talk.	He will.
Is he sick?	Cancer.
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.	You make it sound like I'm already dead.
Are you all right?	I've been better --
It won't work on you.	What are you talking about?
Get out of here --	I'm not leaving without you.
Please --	Listen to your father, Jason. It's going to be a better world.
How could you be a part of this?	These are my people now. I'm one of them.
This isn't human blood.	Then what is it?
Five minutes, not a second more. And I don't want to hear a word about "us".	No problem.
That's weird --	What?
We keep in radio contact.	You've been listening in the whole time?
Why didn't you tell me the truth about him?	We weren't sure we could trust you.
I wouldn't go in there if I were you. It's best to leave him alone when he's like this.	I'll take my chances.
--and if she ever did--	--which she may have--
I need you to talk to me, talk to me about the dreams--about James, the other boys.	I don't#I don't understand them myself.
What, are you alright?	My eye, is there something in my eye?
No.	Closer.
Please! Please#? I haven't done anything.	Bullshit! Talk!
Why?	Any number of reasons--pick one, it's as good as the other.
Yeah, so?	So whoever built this--
--nothing left to play 'em on, honey.	Oh, sorry, right.
Hang you like the witch you are, unless--	--Nick!!
Jesus.	What?
No.	You sure?
What?	You said the name "James."
Baby names?	I don't know. Nightmare.
--or someone--	--scared the living shit out of us.
--now c'mon!	Get your goddamn--
What can I get you?	Sleep.
Nothing. I dunno--	--you should get back into bed.
I want to see something!	Whatever you want.
--like you hurt the baby--	--what're you saying?? I didn't have anything to do with--
You're gonna owe me the rest of your life, bud.	I know, I know.
I know you're in there, you piece of shit!	You have to go.
So, I hear you're from New Mexico!	Sometimes.
This is a little nuts.	Turn the tapes back on.
Does it hurt?	Like hell. Play the goddamn tape.
I don't believe this.	I do.
What movies?	Ask me what I don't have.
What I never could figure about the movie?	What?
What're you, crazy??	What're you, nuts?
Get out of here!	What're you doing with all this shit?
--yeah, a hand or something--	--coming out of the water--
Get inside quick, they'll stop.	Too busy eating us?
Fire escape??	Don't have one.
Where?	Down there in the Park.
What the fuck--??	--I don't know.
Be it still alive, James?	What--
Nobody's going anywhere--	--hell, I don't think I'm ever leaving this place again--
Who?	No one ever comes here.
Hold this.	What?
You drive, I'll handle the video, okay?	Fine.
What're you doing?	This isn't about us.
What?	Look over there.
Okay, but--	--now there.
What--	--oh, Jesus--
Well, she's got to be somewhere here.	No one's been in or out since you left. Would've heard the dogs.
Just hold on!	I can't!
Just let it go, I've got you!	What're you nuts--
Someone want to tell me what's going on--	--and we brought it back with us!
The four of you really have too much spare fucking time on your hands, don't you?	And what's your excuse for being here?
What is it you thought you saw on that tape?	Still working on it.
Dad#?	What'd you say?
Jesus.	What?
You gonna be alright?	Sure. I'm sorry.
She wasn't a witch.	Whatever.
Finally got her back to sleep.	Nick, what you should do is get her back up and get her to a goddamn doctor.
What?	I dunno it's anything. It's a name Anna's mentioned--from her dreams.
No. We all go.	Anna--
You're gonna keep an eye on Marty and Ray, make sure nothing happens.	It won't?
#Ray?	Yeah.
Why d'you wanna leave all this?	You kidding? I don't wanna leave all this, I just wanna leave Marty#
Who was it?	What?
#Well I'll be damned.	I couldn't believe it either#
Nothing. He's like you, he doesn't say much.	Thanks.
#You all right?	I don't know. I better get off now.
#Ray?	You're bad.
#What?	I said you're bad.
Why didn't you get into bed?	I didn't think I could sleep. I'm surprised you could. Are you all right?
#You called me this morning.	Yeah.
#I just wanted to let you know that everything was all right. I took care of everything. Now all we have to do is keep our heads.	#What do you mean?
#Anyway, we got some time now. But we gotta be smart.	Ray--
#That's what's important.	I don't know what you're talking about.
I# I mean what're you talking about, Ray? I haven't done anything funny.	#What was that?
#Who?	Marty.
#What's going on with you two?	All right#
#You leaving?	Isn't that what you want?
#But first I gotta know what happened.	What do you want to know?
#So?	I think someone's watching.
Hold it, hold it. What's tonight?	What?
#You know that car?	No.
#What was that back there?	Back where?
What "what"?	Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
Then what'd you come here for?	You owe me for two weeks.
What did you take these for?	What do you mean#
#Just doin' my job.	You called me, I knew they were there, so what do I need these for?
Now that don't make much sense.	No. It just made them feel better.
#Anything else?	Yeah, don't come by here any more. If I need you again I know which rock to turn over.
#That's the test, ain't it? Test of true love--	Got a job for you.
#Gee, I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me what you want me to do or is it a secret?	Listen, I'm not--this isn't a joke here.
You want me to kill 'em.	I didn't say that.  Well?
So, uh# this wouldn't interest you.	I didn't say that. All I said was you're an idiot. Hell, you been thinking about it so much it's driving you simple.
Yeah. Is it#	Ya catch any fish?
Just the ten thousand'll be fine.	Got something to show me first?
Dead, huh?	So it would seem.
#What did you do with the bodies?	It's taken care of. The less you know about it the better.
Something I got to ask you, Marty. I've been very very careful. Have you been very very careful?	Of course.
#I just made a call about that. It'll look fine.	I must've gone money simple. This kind of murder#
#Count it if you want.	Nah, I trust ya.
What's this?	You said the usual--
What's this?	What.
#I thought you were dead. Going home?	No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
Is Marty here?	Not here tonight. Wasn't here last night. He's especially not back in his office.
#Why?	You shouldn't have taken the money#
Where was I?	You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.

Are you alright?	Yeah. let's get outta here. What happened?
I was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. Was it alright?	Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
So. what's next?	Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
You really want to do this, don't you?	I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
Here's to. an interesting experience.	I'll drink to that.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.	Why not?
Well, how did it go?. What happened?	Well. I've found out some things. nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
What's with Mike?	He got a little jealous.
Can I give you a kiss good night?	You better not, Jeffrey.
You were late.	I'm really sorry.
Great. Hey. I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things. that could help your father but you might get into trouble.	Jeffrey. are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey. I mean it.
Everything okay?	Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
I should never had gotten you going on this.  Yes Jeffrey. Friday's on!	Okay. great!
Okay.	What is it?
What was that all about?	Nothing. really! It's good to see you.
You want to dance?	I can't dance fast.
You want to dance?	Okay.
Oh my God. What's wrong?	Frank!!
My father has a gun at home.	No.
Hi Dad.	Hey Jeff.
Good to see you, son.	It's good to see you, Dad.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?	This is it.
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.	Be right down.
I'm going out for awhile.	Do you want the car?
Can I use the car tonight?	Of course, Jeffrey.
God. you scared me.	Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.	Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.	Yeah, I know.
He comes over to study.	Yeah.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?	That sounds great!
Come on out a minute, okay?	Okay.
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.	# Stop it Mike.
Are you sure this guy is cool?	You'll see for yourself.
This is it for me.	What is?
Are you sure this guy is cool?	You'll see for yourself.
This is it for me.	What is?
Should we buy it?	Are you kidding?
You wanna split?	Yeah, I don't feel so well.
Surprise.	Baby, you didn't have to come.
Why are you speaking?	Excuse me?
What did I tell you?	It's great and everything, but what am I going to do with all this?
It's nothing personal, George.  Just business.	Yeah.  I understand.  Just business. Right.  Fuck you.
If you don't mind me asking, what is the reason you are in this place?	What?
Oh, come on, George.  If we are to be friends, we must trust each other.	Murder.
George, good to see you, my brother.	What the fuck is going on?  When did you get out of jail?
I'm calling it three.	We're half a million off.
Where do I put this!?	Try the back bedroom.
Tell him I don't want to see him.  Tell him he's not welcome here.	Mom.
I just can't get over the size of that ring.  I just love it.  Fred, look at it.  Tell me you don't love that ring.	I'm just happy that George has found someone he cares for.
George, you look terrible.	Yeah, well#
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.	That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
What are you going to do?	I'm going to California.
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.	That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
What are you going to do?	I'm going to California.
Just low.	You loved her, didn't you?  You really loved her.
You mad at me?	Not mad.
You're like your mother.  You love money.	Dad.
She's angry.  It's all over the news.	Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile.
Tell Mom, you know#	I'll tell her.
How are you doing, George?	What do you guys want?
Figured it out.	Figured what out?
Figured it out.	Figured what out?
Hello.	Hello.
You better know what you're doing, George.  You're playing with fire.	I like fire.
George.  Oh, Jesus Christ, George.  Look at you.	Shhh, honey, never mind.  It's alright. It's over.  I quit the business.  I'm out.
Not in front of the kid.	Don't give me that shit.  You just better do something.
You should have taken better care of me, you know?  You've been away a long time. Four years.  Say something.	What do you want me to say?  I'm in prison.  You should know.  You put me here.
Hey, look.  You start paying, who knows what will happen.  You're a good father, George.  I always gave you that.  But you've got to talk to her.	Yeah.
Hey, George.  You okay?	Yeah.  I'm fine.  I'm good.
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset.	What's happening to us?
I don't know.	Are we gonna split up?
What are you doing here?	Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I was out.  I just wanted to see you.
Let me ask you something.  If you could go anywhere in the world, anywhere, where would you want to go?	You mean, like a trip?
Bye, Dad.  See you in the morning, okay?	I'll be here.
I'm thinking about getting out of town this week.  You want to come with me?	Where are you going?
I'm sorry, baby.  I'm so sorry.	It's alright, Dad.
It's not enough.	What?
So?	So, we need to get to the source.
But I haven't shot him.	You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.
And how many are we?	Not enough.
Can you read?	Sure #
Read it.	Here?
Are you ready, colonel?	Yes # But let me first see you.
Before you ask there's nothing new on the coke.	You've got to get me something I can use, Charlie.
I've been waiting for you to get back.	You got something on the coke?
I think I'm going to make your day.	How?
Yeah.	Then you can go.
About three hours.	Cause?
What are you saying, Henry?  That his girlfriend fucked him to death?	Yes.
No questions.	You may call your next witness.
That's it.  My client doesn't have to take this crap from you.	Sit down, Frank.
She's innocent.	Aren't they all?
What's happening to you, Frank? You're acting like you're on trial here.  This has become personal to you.	Back off, John.
Why did she say she was leaving?	She didn't.  She just left.
You'll be sorry?	I was angry.
You can suggest anything you want. It happened.	No further questions.
I heard him say it.	Then -- those are not your own words?
I don't know.  I'm not sure.	Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible?
Yes.	It must have been horrible.  Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.
You take what people say and make it ugly.  You make others believe what you want them to.  She should have been found guilty.  She shouldn't have gotten off.	Then you would have gotten your money?
I'm gonna go to jail.  I know they're gonna make it look like I did it. They gotta put it on someone.	Why'd you come here?
Hi, Joe.	Frank -- what are you doing here?
Would it be fair to say that when she did find out it was a shock to her?	Yes.
Do you think I did it?	I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.
Frank!	I'll have you out in a few hours.
I think we're getting a little off the subject here.	I thought the subject was sex?
Can we get out of here?	Sure.  Where to?
This is your house.	I know.
Why not?	Because, I'm your attorney.  I shouldn't be going to your house.
Hello?	Hi.  It's Frank.
Sorry.	It's okay.
Yes -- it would be nice.	What would?
You lied to me!	What?
I called you all weekend.  Where were you?	I went out on the boat.
Alone?	Of course.
You were brilliant today.	It's only the beginning.
Can I see you later?	You can see me now.
Sugar or honey?	Honey.
What are you going you doing?	Are you scared?
You killed him.  You killed him -- and I got you off.	That's crazy.
I love you.	I love you too, Dad.
Michael -- get off the phone.	Why?
Can't it wait?	No -- it has to be done by tomorrow.
She sounds like quite a woman.	Yeah -- but can she cook?
Frank -- I know you're busy, but Michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him.  He wanted to know why you weren't talking to him.	I'll talk to him later.
Is that alright, Frank?	Yeah -- fine.  Excuse me.  I'll be right back.
Yeah -- what are you doing up?	We have to talk.
I know.	Talk to me.
Frank -- stop it!  Stop it!	Is this what you want -- huh?  Is it?
Don't use language like that at the dinner table.	Sorry.
Yes.	What time did you leave?
He dropped them off at Betty's mom. Where's Steve?	He's not coming.
Yeah.	Michael.
He's getting her drunk. That's what happened. Jesus, maybe he forced himself. That's why she couldn't tell us.	Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.
Bar across the street.	Have you called Betty?  Maybe you should.
She's changed.	Oh, yes.
So, how long you've been living here?	Long.  You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
Oh there you are.	Oh! You caught me.
Oh, that's nice.	Want another cigarette?
Mind if I smoke?	Not at all.
He's very# clean.	Clean?
Feeling better?	Much.
And did you?	I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.
My mistake. I apologize.	What made you ask such a question?
It's Robert.	Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still#
Yeah?	I want you to come.
Sorry I'm late. Richard called.	Oh, how is he?
Are you comfortable?  Do you# want to move to the bedroom?	No. I can't. Not yet.
You want to eat something?	Are you hungry?
Take me somewhere.	What?
Oh, I'm sorry.	It's okay. It's not that hot anymore. Thanks God.
But you don't mind.	No, I don't mind.
I can't do this, honey.	What?
Where was she?	Across the street. She went into the park and got turned around and didn't know her way out.
I don't know why I'm so tired all of a sudden.	Long day. Go to sleep.
Sleep all right?	Yes, thanks.
No matter how I keep turning it around in my mind -- it doesn't seem like the right thing.	For who?
What time is it?	Later. Go back to sleep.
I'm positive.	I'm going to miss you.
Are you seeing Betty tonight?	Nah.
Okay.	What's her name?
Uh# Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice.	Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
Oh my God#!	What happened?
Think for a second. Is there someplace she said she wanted to go?	I don't remember!
About an hour ago.	They're not going to find her!
When did she decide this?	Apparently just before her death.
Don't feed that dog.	You people really don't like dogs.
We can't go back there.  Are you crazy? You saw --	It's the only way.  It's possible your father may not be dead yet.
Is it true?	Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too.
Hey, kid.	Yeah?
You think that's really him?	Damn.  It's so#fresh.
You want us to move in here?	That's the only way we'll get the place fixed up in time.
You ain't going down there.  Not alone. I'll go.	Fine.  But I'm bringing a couple of friends.
That's what?	That's some terrible shit.
I ain't interested.  And if you gonna sell it, don't sell it round here.	Just try it.
No?  That mean there's something more left of you than just that hungry spirit? What are you going to do now?  Kill us? Kill us all?	No.  Not#not you.  You I forgive.
Jimmy, you've got --	I've got what I want.  Turn around baby, look at me.  Look at your man.
I want you to do something for me, baby.	What?
Where are we, baby?	Where we'll always be#
What it will be.	How did you get in here?
Aren't you going to join us?	I have to finish this for class.
He'll kill them.  He'll kill every last one of them.	Who?
Told you so.  Alright.  We tried.  Let's go home.	Mother!  No.
Are they on the radio?	Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
Careful.  That's bad luck.	That place is already bad luck.
I can't.  Not yet.	It's alright.  If you want to go home#
I'm here.	Bill!  Bill?!
We gotta jump!	I can't!
You got the cash?	You got the shit?
Let me see it.	Let me see it.
But maybe we're the ones who should be down there.  Doing something.  Making it better.	Can't be done.  That place already died and gone to hell.
Why?  Why did you give a shit about the building?  Why did you care that we were there of all places?	It's#it's a bad neighborhood.  As you can see now.
Please#help me#	Dad?
Help me.  I'm so sorry.  But please, help me#	Daddy?
No way man#	You cut him, or I shoot you.  Make your choice.
Jimmy Bones?	Yeah, you heard of him?
Not really to live, just to play.	That building?
Boy, put that thing down.  You can't take that.  Might be evidence.	Evidence of what?
Shit!  Damn dog.  We gonna have to do something about you.	What we have to do is call the police.
You shouldn't have hit me.	You want to get into this now?
That's right, I know.  I fucking know.	Know what?
How the fuck can I open it?	The same way you did before.
You don't think I'll do it, do you?	I think you're fucking crazy!
We know how this was done, eh?	Yeah, I know.
We're family, Caesar.	No!
I didn't expect --	What the fuck is going on?
So, you just got out?	Jesus, Caesar!
Not bad.  What for?	That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
Caesar, I'm serious.  This is too much.  I have to get out of here.	Why?  'Cause you know him?
Just look at this mess I got to deal with.	What are you going to do with it?
Don't worry, I'll get some more.	There's no time.
They were early.	What are you talking about?
You mean they weren't up here?	No!  They're still on their way.
I hate that little fuck!  I hate him!  I hate him!  I should've done him!	But you know he did it.
Got to think this through #	Caesar, maybe we should run --
I got it!  I know what I got to do! I got to get the money.	The money?  The money's gone.
He didn't see you, did he?	No.
You can't leave.	The hell I can't!
It would have been so easy to let him in as you went out.	You don't, you can't believe that #
#  maybe three hours.	Caesar, what are you going to do?
Fuck.	Caesar, what are we going to do?
Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck!	Caesar, someone could see us out here.
It's not here, Caesar.	Where, then?
What are you doing?	We're going to need some time.
Where is the money?	Don't tell him --
What did she do to you?	Everything you couldn't.
We were in a car accident --	They were in a car accident.
We make a deal or I come out and hand this phone to Mickey.	I'm listening.
Not on duty, sorry.	Oh, right.
I'm going to make myself a drink, if that's okay?	Go right ahead, sir.
How many'd you do?	Five.
I'm going to ask you where the money is.  Every time you don't give me an answer, I'm going to cut off one finger.	No.
You can't kill me yet.	Why?
Caesar, didn't I tell you to get something?	Sure, Mickey.  Sure.
Yeah?	Hey, Mickey.
Is that the money?	Yeah, that's it.
Hey, Caesar, where's the key?	The key, yeah, the key's in my pants in the bathroom.
Call me as soon as you get him.	Leave your phone on the hook.
Hello?	This is the police, ma'am.
No joke, ma'am.  Please open the door.	How do I know you are cops?
Ma'am, you have to open the door.	All right.
See?  We're for real.	I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
This is a beautiful place.	#  thank you.
Truck.	Truck.  Of course.
Okay, one drink.	What do you want?
Curious, maybe.	Curious?  That's funny, I'm feeling a bit curious myself right now.
Are you surprised that I know what it is?	Maybe.
I had to see you.	Look, I don't think this is a good idea.
#  I needed that.	Tell me about it.
You didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to.	I guess I wanted to.
What's wrong?	Nothing.
Yes there is.  I felt it this morning when I brought you the coffee.	Shit, here we go.
Fuck it!  I think you better leave.	I think so, too.
Caesar is going to get the money and bring --	How much money?
All right, let's say for the moment that I believe everything you are saying.	You think I'm lying?
The difference is, I can have sex with someone I just met, someone I hardly know, but to steal I need to know someone like I know myself.	Do you think you know me like that?
And where is it now?	In his office.  I saw it this morning.
It's in a case, on his desk.	Does the case lock?
Yes.	Good.
What time did you say they would be there?	The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
We want him to come down, to relax, feel in control again.	Poor boy, has to work so hard.
Where will you be?	Waiting in the apartment next door.
What if he sees you?	He won't.
I'm just asking, what if?	If he does #
I still don't see how I'm going to get clean with the money in the apartment.  Everyone will think I did it.	Not Caesar.
He'll have to run.	If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
Jesus, that's beautiful.	Thank you.
I had a partner and she fucked me.	I won't.
It's me.	What happened?
Oh, thank God.	I'm still here.
Hey.	Hey.
Done.  We go now.	Jesus Christ, Pop.  You got two hours until your plane leaves.
You shouldn't have to see this.  Why don't you get out of here?  Go for a walk.	Caesar wants me to stay.
Oh, God.	Caesar?  What the fuck time is it?
I will never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police.	I told you, the family doesn't want the police around.  We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him.  I swear I will.
-- he went inside! --	-- if we can get a clean shot --
I won't ask again.	I work alone.  Like you#  #we always work alone.
What did you do to me?	What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
Was this a game or a fuck up?	I don't know.
Kane.  Do you have Mr. John Michael Kane?	One moment, sir.
Mr. Kane#  Come right in#please#have a seat.	Thanks.
Well#  I must admit, when my assistant told me you were here I was, really -- I was quite -- I was surprised.	Really.
Jesus#	Get me out of here.  Please.
So what's in Paris?	I want to go home.
I said ten thousand.	You have blood on your pants.
Look, I want a ride to Paris.  That's all I want.  I swear.	You swear?  That's great.  I feel so much better now.
Just so you know, if you're gonna burn me on the money, you might as well kill me.  I was supposed to have this car back three days ago.  It's not my car.	I know that.
I don't know.  I don't know who I am.	Yeah, well, welcome to the club.
I needed a break.	Where are we?
You ever think maybe you have a family?	I thought about it.  I don't know.
Slow down.  No, don't stop.  Just#	That's it?  Is that it?
Where?	Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.
So this is it, right?	I guess.
I should go.	I don't remember any of this.
Okay, so#	Thanks for the ride.
Look, I don't know what's up there.	You got me pretty fucking curious.
This is like a real apartment.  This is really yours?	I guess so.
-- what're you doing? -- Jason, please, tell me what's happening!	Open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
I found it.  It took six calls.  I found Kane.  I found the body.	Let's go --  We got to get away from this phone.
It doesn't matter who you were before.  It's who you want to be. That's all that matters.  We have this money.  We have what we have.  I had nothing before and now, I don't know, maybe I have more, maybe it's nothing, but#  I say we leave here.  We leave this place.  We go until we can't go anymore.	You could do that?
Stop where you are.	What?
Who is it?	We have to keep moving.
And that's it?	If you're lucky.  Take it.  There's enough in there to make a life.  Any life.  Just get out now. Get low.  Stay low.  Take it.
What was I thinking, right?	I can't protect you anymore.
Can I help you?	This your store?
Is this it? --  -- this is it, right? --	-- slow down -- you can't just take the book like that --
Where's the dog?	My husband's out looking for him.
What the hell're you talking about?	You're in danger.  All of you.  I have no time to explain.
Sir#	What's that?
What the fuck is he doing?	Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
You're awake.  Can you hear me?  You've been shot.  I'm trying to help you.  You were in the water.  You've been shot.  It's okay now.	Where am I?
What if it doesn't come back?	I told you.  You need to rest.
#Be back.	Thank you.
I think we'd better have a look.	# have a look.
What have you got there?	Got there!
Ah ha # there you are, Sam.	What? How do you know my name?
If I can help you #	Well, I #
Sam!	Jack!
What's the matter?	Sorry. Nothing.  See you - I'm going to be late.
Jack!!	SAM! What a surprise!
Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.	Do you know what you're doing.
Jack, she's innocent!	Sam - we've always been close, haven't we?
Jack?# Jack?	Shut up!
You stupid bastard!	What?
Are you alright?	It's you # it's you #
Who are you? Let go!	Don't look back! Act naturally!
What are you doing? For Christ's sake! Get moving!	Who are you?
Bloody hell! Do as I say!	No.
# This is amazing # for me # being here with you. I mean, in my dreams you #	I don't want to hear about your fucking dreams!
You know, smoking's bad for you.	It's my fucking life.
It's heavy.	A heavy Christmas present.
Why don't you say, no system is perfect.	Well, no system is.
Look at that - right on time.	What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
I was right! Step on it!	Let go! We've got to stop!
Come on, let's go! Let's get out of here!	Oh God! What have we done?
I'm going to open it!	No you're not!
They're gone.	Are you sure?
Make yourself at home. Don't answer the phone or open he door to anyone. I won't be long.	Where are you going?
He is dead.	Dead! Oh no! That's terrible! We'll never get rid of the damned thing! What are we going to do?
That's it.	You are good to me Sam.
My mother said it would be all right.	She didn't say anything about it to me.
Sam!!! 	Mother? # What # what's # you've got to help me #
Uh #	He hadn't done anything # He was good # What have you done with his body?
Put the phone down and your hands up.	What? Who is this?
Are we?	Ah yes, the lady is waiting.
No, not at all. I mean, it's all right. It's fixed.	Fixed?
I mean it fixed itself.	Fixed itself.
Now look what you've done to him.	Have you got one or haven't you?
Sign here please.	What is it?
Nice and easy now. Keep your hands where I can see them.	What is this?  Who the hell are you?
Are you expecting anyone?	No. Wait here.
You know each other a long time?	Two years. Ever since we left island.
She wanted something to help her sleep.	Mary, we really have to go.
I guess I'll be going.	Just take it easy.
Does that hurt?	No!
So, Frank, am I going to live?	You're going to live.
Twelve Young, answer the radio. I have a call for you.	She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
Okay, what happened?	He's going to be all right, right?
You're not going to die.	What did you say?
Here, you try.	No, I'd better not.
Do you have any music?	What?
Is there any chance?	I guess there's always a chance.
It's my first cigarette in over a year.	The first is always the best.
That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn't he?	Yes.
It's been bad lately, but it's always bad.	How long you been doing this?
I shouldn't have asked you to come.	You asked me not to come.
Mary. Mary, we've got to get going.	No, no.
What is it? You want to help me, you feel sorry for me? Keep it to yourself.	I need to sit down a minute.
This is not a good time.	There's no time.
Who is it?	Frank.
It's coming.  Hold her down.	What's that, Frank?
Don't give me that look.	What look?
Where you going?	I quit! I'm through!
He's dead, Rose. Your father passed.	How can that be? He was getting better.
Would you like to come in?	Yes.
These are hard times, Tom.	Yeah. Great, isn't it?
Where you going?	C'mon, Tom. The city's burning.
Mr. Oh.	It's early for him.
Let's break something, Tom. Let's bust something, bomb something.	What do you want to break?
Turn it off.	What?
You wanted it turned off. There's no such thing as a good fire. People get burned up. They can't breathe.	That's what we're here for. Come on, Frank.
Well why didn't you say so?	He's drunk.
Faster! God!	Faster!
I'm not feeling very well, Larry. I say we go back to the hospital and call it a night.	You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that.
He's crazy.	You really think so?
You're in the stomach!	You sure?
You're in the stomach! Let me try.	One more time!
Stomach again.	No way!
Shit, shit, shit#	You're almost there, you can do it -- can do -- can do.
Okay if I watch you tape that interview downstairs?	Yeah.
What did I do to you?	You've made my dreams silly.
Yes.	There are only ten.
Wait.	What?
No.  No.	No?
You know what I#	No, I liked the way it made me sound. Okay.  Be good.  So long.
Hi.	Well, this kid couldn't possibly belong to anyone else.  What's your name?
Where's where I asked him about being scared?  You should work on your speech.	No.  It makes me nervous to think about it.  Let's do this.
Okay.  Let's do me.	Sure.
Nine seconds.	Eleven and a half.
I write for you sometimes.	Not because you have to.
What happened?	I'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from?
You know you've had a strange day# I'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking.	Absolutely#You go have a good time# You have some place to go?
How'd it go?	You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
I told what's his name -- Tom -- that I'd meet him.	Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?
Don't go.	This is important to me.
What?	Let me think a second.  It's tough.
I think you're the Devil.	No.  You know that I'm not.
Don't say anything about anything.	Hi.  Will I ever sing again?
Let's go#	I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
Ready.	Your hair's a little funny.
Oh, I was just writing you a note. What do you say we take a walk?	Outside?
Do it then.	Please prepare carefully.  This couldn't come at a better time.
Okay.  I think I'd better be alone for a while.	I understand.  I'll go with you.
Just a few questions?	No.
We came from Washington.	Move away from me.
Okay.  I just wanted you to know.	What is she shooting?
I was a little nervous there for a minute.	Oh, come on -- tell us another.
Just when do you start, telling people?	Almost immediately.
You don't have time.  Not a chance.	I'll be right down.  It's right tight.
What did he say?	I'll never tell.
What are you dressed up for?  Oh, that's right -- because the Evening News is here this week.	I spent a fortune on this.
Play back the last line#	He said something about#
They're not really going to call security are they?	No, I don't think so.
Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore.	Okay.
What?	They fired me.
I had no idea she was this good.	Fill for a second.
Hi.  I was worried I was early.	I was a lot earlier.
If we could just eat first.	Totally understood.  Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had.  Totally sorry.
I never told you the reason I was telling you everything for.	Hey?
They said it would be okay if#	We're working here!!  You can stand over in the uh, uh, uh#
Hi.	How's it going?
You okay?	Yes.  Just don't say anything mean for a while.  Thanks.
Nervous?	Excited.
You're an amazing woman.  What a feeling having you inside my head.	Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.
It's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you.	Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
Maybe we could just sit here -- talk a little?	Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?
So you like me, huh?	I like you as much as I can like anyone who thinks I'm an asshole.
It's incredible who's here.	Who?
You okay?	Great.
Why can't I let go of this woman?	Well#
I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight.  You know why?	Because you're nuts.
I don't remember saying anything like that -- exactly#I don't know why I just did.	Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well, I can think of two reasons.
Hi.  It's me.	Where are you?
Hi, again.  Sorry about#	No.  That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.
Hello?	Yes.
Then give me a minute#	You fucking#
I don't wan to discuss work.	Well, let's do a special report on that#I mean that's news.
You're lucky I came after you so you got that off your#	Yes, I am.  Thanks.  I mean it.
Take it easy.	Why did I have to do this to myself?  Watch you take off.  Call me if you need anything.
What a great surprise.  I didn't think we had a chance.  I heard you wanted to stay in Washington.	Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot.
I sure know that feeling.  Terrific work today.	Right back to you.
That's enough.  That's enough.	I'm sorry.
Don't you work here?	Not anymore!
Would you like to do me?	I just might.
Tonight.	What, right now?
Not even a little bit?	I already told you I'm not.
Walter can I ask you something?	What!
Alright we're clear.	Anything new?
What the hell's going on?	Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
Don't worry about him#what have you got?	A thing I made.
You really like it?	Of course#it's wonderful.
Look at the size of it!	It's not really that big I got it on kind of a stand#
How did you ever find it all in yourself, Walter?	It wasn't easy.
What's up, Walter?	I came over to see you.  I brought something#I wanted to show you.
Is it murdered man?	Better!
Where where#	There there#
Did you hear what he said?	Yes Walter.
It's true, isn't it?	Every word#
I mean, you look so pretty.	Thank you.
Goodbye.	Bye!
Now calm down Walter!  Now, let's go in there, and when the show's over, maybe we can talk about it.	No! I want to talk about it now!
I'm sorry about what I said before.	Forget it.
Walter#there's#	What?
That's word for word.	Is it?  I've forgotten.
Put it in the middle of the room!	When did you make this, Walter?
Ah, your new head shot#  I like it, very much#	Do you have to be so cold to him?
Hi Walter#	What are you doing here so early?
Maybe so#	I wouldn't give up your day job.
Are you trying to be funny?	I'm totally serious!
Murdered#man?#	When do we get to see it? WALTER Well#any time, I guess.
Are you alright?	Yes#I'm uh#I'm fine.
What's the matter with you?	Nothing#nothing at all.
No.  Why don't you cover it up Walter#	Why not?
Look at that, man.  Big deal.	I know.
There's that weird dude again.	Man if this place doesn't cool out I'm gonna hang out somewhere else#
What did he say?	Didn't you hear him?
Where'd ya buy that?	I didn't buy it I made it.
You#made that?	I said I did, didn't I!
Dead Cat!	Dead Cat?
You want to buy it, put it in the club?	You want me to buy Dead Cat?  It'll scare people away.
Well#why did you put a knife in it?	I didn't mean to.
People seem to like my cat.	Enough already about it - get to work!
Well#why murdered man?	I don't know, it just happened, I guess.  I didn't mean to.
It's hot in here#	You want me to open a window or something?
What do you have in the box?	Just wait till you see this!
I tried to contact you by phone but I couldn't#	Excuse me I have to make a call#
How ya doin'?	Uh, hi.
You're gonna shoot me!	Turn around!
YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME!	Walter shut up and relax!
Are you done with these?	Yes, get rid of them#
Hi.	Good morning Walter!
I won't say good luck, Walter.	Why not?
I get it Walter.  I get it.	What do you get?
I want you to have it.  There's a little something for you in here#	Gee.  Thanks.
What's wrong with you!?!	My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
I look horrible.	The other two -- the new ones. Where are they?
Whoa!  Whoa!  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry. I don't actually need any right now.	What's with you?
Nice to feel needed.	Let's move out!
No, we didn't.	Oh, yeah.  But I still want to know what happens.
It's coffee.	Amazing!
You're the guys from the movie!	We hate you guys!
Excellent.	What's playing there?
Your parents are always going away for the weekend.  You're so lucky.	Yeah, I guess.
Oh, my God.  Is that true?	Probably.  What movie is this?
He doesn't look fifty.	Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.
You okay?	I# yeah, I'm okay.  I'm fine.
Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.  Oh, wow.	You were having a nightmare.
What'd you dream about?	Nothing.
Hey there.	Hi.
Are you going out with Jeffrey tonight?	Jealous?
Hey, baby, how ya doing?  You look beat.	I do?  I guess I do.
I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.	So I noticed.
I am a God!  A God!	I am so sure.
Will you guys shut up, please?	It could happen.
Hi.	Hi there.
I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my mom's room if you want.	I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
I didn't expect to see you.	I know.
I'm going to the dance.	What for?
Are you okay?	Get away from me!
What are we doing?	Why don't we see a movie?
Let's meet tonight, okay?	Where?
You were supposed to be here at three.	I forgot.
Excuse me for having something important to do.	This isn't important?  The earth is our home.
Just stay away from me, okay?	Did you ever dream that you were someone else?
How do you know all this?	I have to show you.
Where's the other one?	She --
What, um#  What do we do?	There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time.
Who we gonna beat?	Who we gonna beat?
Oh, what the hell is wrong with you?  You threw a knife at my head!	I had to test you.
What!?!	Try to pay attention.
He was slow.  Very simple.  They won't all be that easy.	Fine.
Five?	Five.
None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.	And where are they now?
Wait!	He knows who I am!
Come one, that was so weird.	What, it's not weird.  I just cut the stupid hot dog in half.
-- like she's gonna kill me.	I was just scared is all.
That is so cool.	Thank you very much.
Hi, guys.	Hi.
I haven't seen him tonight.	Oh.
I can't!	You know you must.  There is only one.  Now you are that one.  It is time.
Write that down.	Okay, what else?
Oh, yes!  Yes!	Oh, baby!
Well, I'm done.  Are you done?	No --
I can't believe they still ate it.	Where'd you learn how to do that?
Cool!	Does Jeffrey know?
Oh, yeah!	Right!
Ah, you'll be coming back.	I don't think so.
Yeah maybe you're right.	You see how nice things are when we go slow?
How was that?	A little better.
God#I think I'm gonna be sick--	Oh don't be silly.  Death is nothing to be scared of.  It's just another way of living.  It's just a fresh start--kinda like spring training.
That's my leg.	I know what it is.
No!  You're playing with my mind!	I'm trying to play with your body!
I'd like you to meet my father.	Oh--won't YOU come in?
I gotta leave first thing in the morning.	That's great!
Neither will I.	I think I'm ready for the Show.
Five hours.  We both just know.  Do you think I deserve to wear white?	We all deserve to wear white.
She's dancing with me.	Crash, I didn't think you--
Wait, Crash--don't go--all I want is a date.  I'm not gonna fall in love with you or nothin'.	I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy.
Damn.	Let me.
How come you don't like me?	'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  You got a gift.
Can I ask you something?	What?
I was playing naked.	I know, I know--I have that dream all the time.  We're almost home.
Write this down.  "We gotta play 'em one day at a time."	Boring.
"#Good Lord willing, things'll work out."	Yep.  So how's Annie?
What's wrong?	I'm nervous--my old man's here.
I'm going to the Show.	Then go.
I'm trying to thank you.	Let go of me!
C'mon, we got nothin' to fight about.	You fuck!
Good.  Good.  That's terrific#	What?
Sorry about last night.	Forget it.
We want you to room with him on the road and stay on his case all year.  He can go all the way.	And where can I go?
Step outside, pal.	Love to--
Well tell 'em, honey.	We're getting married.
Crash ain't there.  He never gets back till four or five--	Where does he go?
Thank you.	#he did what he was told.
Look at yours.	What?
Hey, I need a room. Need a room.	Good to see ya.  William would you#
#stupid things.	Watch it, partner, watch it!
Yeah, I don't want her in there more than a few more minutes.	No, it's - it'll just be a couple of minutes. We got other things to do too, you know. He'll hurry her up. How's everything else besides this?
Stop -	Wait, hold on a second.
She's my wife.  Look at me. You did know that, didn't you? You knew that she's my wife? Huh? Hey, look at me.	Yeah, yeah. I know that.
Okay.	You fuckin' piece of shit.
Hello.	Hello.
You understand? Put her on the fuckin' phone.	Sam, I - I don't know where she is, okay?
Sam, let me ask you a question. You must really trust your wife.	Yeah, sure I do. Why?
Oh. Have a good day at school.	Okay.
Dad!	What happened? What happened? Who did this to you?
When did this happen, honey?	I don't know.
You don't know? What time did your mother do this? When did she leave?	I don't know.
Holy shit, what've you been doin' out here?	Honey, come here.
No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did?	No.
Hello.	Listen#
Yeah.	Meet me at three.
Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? Goin' over my head?	What people?
Yeah, what are you doin'? You okay?	No, I'm not okay.
#uh, you know, I just wanted to talk to you a minute.	Well#
Hey, it is my pleasure.	Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
You go and put your things away.	And they were usually right.
We need this guy.	We can't get rid of him?
Sam, we got a problem.	What is it?
Now, he's really pissed.	Oh, no.
Okay. Just take it easy.	Right away. Okay?
Any change?	I hit a few# uh, games on the way back.
You all right?	Yeah.
Want to go? Let's go back in.	Okay.

Hi, Sam.	I mean, you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin' door?  Are#
She, she's alone. Just go. Take the gun and go into Amy's.	You get down here!
I'm afraid to let her in the house.	Oh, you are#
Should I let her in like - ?	You ought to be afraid, the way you fuckin' treat me!
#Well, I've got a large family.	How many kids do you have?
Now, you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.	God! 
Excuse me.	What?
I just wanna get out of here.	And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?
Fuckin' kids at home!  Here.  Get the fuck out of here.	Thanks, Nick.
I don't want to go to Europe.	Shut your mouth!
You know where she gets this from!	You shut up.
No, I don't want one.  Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?	Hi. Good.
Go back inside! This is none of your business!  I don't have to take your shit all the time anymore.	Hey.

You got a round figure on it?	Definitely the most important guy in this room.
Tell me.	I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
I never see - You know, I never seen him act like that with anybody else. I think he's crazy about you. I mean, he really loves you. He does.	Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right?  You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.
And take it easy with this shit, will you? I mean, this can only make matters worse.	Oh, come on.
Thanks.	Yeah.
Thank you.	It's all right.
So, I'm gonna call you back in an hour# at this number, and you're gonna be there, right?	I'll be there.

Hi.	Having a good time?
Works for me.	I don't know about you, guys, but I'm getting a little buzz off this.
I thought you said you weren't a very good liar.	I lied.
I better go report this in#	Oh, you don't have to explain to me where you're going#
You're kidding.	But it's true!  You can call him yourself.
Car wash, Captain?	Absolutely.
Oh, I wish they wouldn't feed him like that.	Now he'll be up all night#
I loved you.	I know.
Next time, call#	I thought you'd like a ride to work.  You don't own a cat, do you?
Hey, Captain God!	What did--?
Did you try to kill#	What?
You're late.	Yes, Mother. Dear.
Hey Buddy!  Can you let me pull over?  Give me some space to pull over.	Where do you think you're going?
Was someone in an accident?	Do I hear a woman's voice?
I'm sorry for whatever's happened to you but we're definitely not the right people to do you any good.	Don't you have children?
Have you got to tell her your life story?	This is my conversation.  I'll say what I fucking please.
Who's on the phone?	I'll explain later.  I'm sort of on hold.
What was that for?	You could've made me lose my call.
He's right, Theo.  She might not be around to back up your story. You could end up in the middle of this.	Look -- I've got the lives of maybe three innocent people hanging on the end of this line.
Are you guys all right?	You could've killed us.
Let's have your license, mister.	I'm going to level with you officer.
Lady, don't let him do it!	You got it wrong.  I'm the one that's on your side.
You missed.	Any time you decide to let me in on it.
He's seen both of us now.	Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
I thought you said you could handle him.	I'm doing fine.  Theo wants to deal.
Do I know you?	I've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  For hours #
Lady, try making some sense.	You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
Will you please speak to me! Theo?	Another minute.
Hello?  It's just me and you again.	What about the others?
What do you do for a living?	Sometimes I paint.
Make a right.  You can't miss it.	I'm making my turn.  I see the school up ahead.
What's happening?	She's gone --
Wait just a minute.  Our luck has changed.	What do you mean?
No.  I hear them.  They're coming upstairs.  They know!	Try what you did before.  It worked before.  I won't talk anymore.
It's locked.	Shit.  I'm sorry.
Now I have -- it's a long story.	Why didn't you just shoot them?
He had a gun.  I have it now.	Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
Sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here.	Why pick me to be your "mark?"
Your friends are probably still on the line.  Pick it up and say hello.	There's no way out for you.  You have to deal with us.
Do you think they'll walk away?	Ask them.
I've got # one last number for you, Theo #	I don't want it.
Thank God -- thank God I've got you.	Who is this?
Oh God -- Oh no -- Help me -- Don't let me -- Die.	Didn't we play this scene before?
You're making it too easy.	You got time on your side.  Pretty soon they'll be missed and we'll have the law up our ass.
Where do we meet?	It's a nice day.  How about the beach?
I'm here.  Where are you?	We don't see you.
Stop the crying.	She's yours.  What are we waiting on?
Count it.	Don't worry.
Seems like it.	Put the girl on.
How far off are you?	Five minutes.
Who were you talking to?	Them.  They won't be expecting us.
Can I make a quick call?	Government business?
So can we consider you a regular, sir?	Is that good or bad?
So let's call this the usual.	Thanks.
She wants me to tell you go fuck yourself.	I'm sorry.
You could always make it up to her.	How?
Just cut his hair, you know.	Yeah?
Saw that one.	What would you call it?
He agreed that he was.	What do you think his name is?
That's what he said. Jimmy.	Hi, Jimmy.
Ask him.	Ask him yourself.
Fuck off, Dave.	C'mon, babe! You know what I like# Easy!
You fucking promised.	Did I?
Don't be like that --	You heard me --
Thank you.	Who the fuck is he?
Take your clothes.	Don't throw my clothes out the window!
Look, I'm sorry.	Fuck off, Dave.
Do you mean that?	He wants to know do I mean that.
What's that supposed to mean?	It's a simple question.
You American?	No.
That should make her happy.	Who's she?
Jimmy.	Jimmy?
Everybody wants something.	Not me.
Hi.	Hi. You forgot your bag.
What was that?	They all get the wrong idea.
You all right?	Yes, thank you.
He's getting up.	You can't leave me then, can you?
You want me to ask you in, right?	No, I didn't --
Now, if you asked me to meet you tomorrow, it would really drive him insane.	Where?
Give me that look again.	What look?
What's that about?	They're jealous.
Now's the time you're meant to do something, isn't it?	Like what?
You got a special friend, Jimmy?	How special?
Jesus Christ!	Jesus.
That Dave?	The things a girl has to put up with.
Piss off, Dave!	Tough guy, huh? Are you going to be all right on your own?
Would you like a drink?	Yes, please.
Someone out there.	Jesus fucking Christ.
He lived here with you?	Tried to. Sit down, will you?
He was different.	How different?
No --	Did you do that to him?
Do you miss him?	What do you think?
So what do you want with me, Jimmy?	Want to look after you.
You mean that?	Yeah.
Why?	If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
Drink.	What is this?
What you thinking of, hon?	I'm thinking of your man.
Did he ever tell you you were beautiful?	All the time.
Even now.	No#
You could?	Do you care, Jimmy?
I didn't mean to hit you.	I know that.
Kind of liked you as a girl.	That's a start.
Do they know?	Know what, honey?
Don't.	Sorry.
There's Dave. He knew too.	Stop it, Jimmy.
Don't ask me in.	Please, Jimmy.
Come on.	Why, honey --
What's wrong, Jimmy? Tell me what's wrong --	Not here.
It's her, isn't it?	What's her?
She own you, Jimmy?	Yes.
What you doing, Jimmy?	I'm not sure.
Why?	It's a secret.
You're no good at this, Jimmy.	I'm sorry.
So it's true, then?	What?
Don't call me that --	Sorry. What you doing?
Why?	For me.
Come on#	No! I'm going home#
So tell me.	I was trying to get out of something.
Don't leave me tonight. Might kill me, too.	Okay.
Why?	Got to be somewhere.
And you'll never leave me?	Never.
Promise?	I promise.
What was it?	You know her, Jimmy?
You'll notice I've asked you nothing.	That's wise, Tommy.
See does he want some.	Do you want some food?
You don't know that.	Fucking do. I had him all over me.
Tough work, that.	Someone's got to do it.
And then you'll leave her out of it?	Aye. Then we'll leave her be.
And what if I say no?	You know what. Go.
You were made for this.	Was I?
Give him a cup of tea.	Do you want a cup of tea?
So he knows your name?	I told him.
Why do you want to do that for?	Would make me feel better about it.
So it was you all the time.	Who'd you think it was?
Fuck you.	Yeah.
Eat something, would you?	Can't.
Hey --	What is it now?
What makes you think that?	They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
Didn't look like that to me#	She's not my type.
You make a nice couple.	Don't I know it.
What the fuck am I doing here.	What the fuck were you doing here?
Take it easy, now. Just go slow. Down by that tree.	Tree.
Now, that was worth waiting for.	Hurry up, would you?
Now put it back in.	Give us a break.
See? I was right about you.	Don't be so sure.
Where would you most like to be now, man?	Doesn't matter where.
See if she's all right.	I don't know her.
Take the whole lot. I won't need it.	I told you not to talk that way --
Don't.	I'm sorry.
Help me.	How can I?
Go to sleep now.	I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
Nothing.	Tell me something, anything.
You stupid bastard --	What you say, faster?
What if I did?	You'd know I wouldn't run off.
Not here.	Who gives a fuck.
I never know nothing.	People. They could be looking.
Have you no feelings, woman?	You shut your face --
I could eat a horse.	I think that's what you ordered.
Oh, you should see your face.	What about it?
Adam!	It's all right -- look.
You don't look so bad in this light.	Why do you think I brought you here?
When you come on, you really come on.	Well -- come on.
What is it?	Open up.
But I didn't kill anybody.	Then who did? You're the only one left.
I said, tell me to go to the --	I heard you, I heard you.
I believe you.	Thanks very much.
Why not?	Because they're still here.
It's Charles!	Very good.
Sorry about that.	Okay -- up there.
Do I knock or something?	Open it.
Keep going.	The view had better be worth it.
Back where?	That's the idea.
Does it hurt?	Haven't you got a bullet I can bite?
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you the truth, but I had to find out your part in all this.	Alex -- how can you tell if someone is lying or not?
I'd love some, thanks.	I'm sorry.
I'm -- I'm sorry.	No. For a few minutes they were mine -- that is enough.
What for? If it's not here, why bother him?	And if it is?
There sure ain't nothin' here worth no quarter of a million.	Not unless we're blind.
What do you mean, no?	The kid said --
You loved him?	I'm very cold.
Is it all right?	I wish you wouldn't.
If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.	Is that all? Can I go now?
Of course it is.	And this?
I don't understand.	And this? And this?
Come on, now -- if you wanted to hide something, where would you put it?	I know. I would bury it in the garden.
What's going on?	Don't you understand French?
You haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there?	I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
We're here.	Where?
Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute.	Be careful, Peter.
Go on.	That's all.
No, they won't -- I won't let them.	Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.
Who is it?	The man you had the fight with.
What'd he say?	He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.
But why do you want a divorce?	Because I don't love him.
He knows everything.	Don't you want me to stay?
Have you no idea who could have done it?	Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name -- now it turns out I didn't even know that.
Do you know him?	I've never seen him before.
Shoot no, not after all these years.	Then he gets it out of your share, not mine! Not mine!
It's almost ten o'clock.	Daddy you scared me!
Hi honey.	What's wrong?
What do you mean?	Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
It was a she.	Are you sure?
You know her?	It can't be.
No!	Run!
What are you doing?	This will relax her.
Your brother told us.	Daddy#.
We just found another body.	Who's?
Pay no attention to me.	What are you doing here?
You fucked me up!	What?
You aren't going to the party?	You know about that too?
of COURSE. You're not scared?	Of course I'm scared.
Please! You wouldn't kill your sister, would you?	You think you're my sister?
Go sit next to him.	Who?
Someone tried to kill me.	The phone just went dead. I called the police and ran right over as fast as I could.
You ok?	FINE. Are you?
You can't tell your parents.	Ok.
This place is empty.	Everyone's getting ready for the party.
Cut it out.	Why?
You know, maybe we ought to start seeing other people.	What?
Are you coming to the party?	Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now.
What's wrong? Am I doing something wrong?	Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
You break up with me because I won't fuck you.	That's not why we broke up.
Please don't go. Please. Stay, We'll just talk. Then go to the party.	This party is sick.
My dad's down there!	He's dead! We've got to get the fuck out of here!
Thanks for coming back for me.	I love you.
Oh GOD IT'S HIM!	Quick! In the house. He won't look for us in there.
Hi mom.	Hi princess.
Wait.	What?
Who?	The men. Do any of them still live around here?
On what side of the family?	His mother's side.
You ok?	Just thinking about something.
What are you doing?	I got to go.
You can have both if you want.	No, you keep one.
You're so beautiful.	So are you.
I said no.	But you don't really mean it.
Maybe it won't stay in.	Maybe you better just drive me home.
Let me just ask you a serious question first.	What?
What, do you work for my boss, dog?	Okay, okay.
 Oh#	#shit.
Aw!  Oh, Jesus.	Hang on.  Hang on.
Sorry, man.  He's dead.	 No.
Go on.	Would you hurry up, please?
We're clear.	Oh, man.
No cell.	Suppose you're gonna shoot me because you can't get service on my cell phone.
Holy shit#	#man!
 Listen!  Listen#	#to him!  You don't know who#
I don't want you to come anyway. 	What?
Keep still.	Okay.  Okay.
 	Bring him down!
Hey, just shut up.	We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!	We're gonna die!
We!	  I've got the real thing!
Here#	#they come!
Okay#	#here comes the#
What the hell?	What the--?
Stupid.	I'm gonna kill him.
Shoot me. 	 What's it say? 
What?	 
Well, hell, the smoke's gonna kill us anyway!	 There's gotta be#
Hang on, hang on.	Let's go!
You did help a little.	Who drove the ice cream#
Oh!	Oh, oh!
Hey.	Hey, be cool.
Give it to me now, or you'll be dead#	#within five minutes.
All right, gentlemen. We're about done here.  Fine job.	Thank you.
Do you know what'll#	#happen if I drop this?
 There's nothing in here, sir.  They got away with it.	All right.  Let's clear the mess and move out.
There.	Check it out.
Doc#	#Long.
I want you to look at one another#	#and ask a simple question -   Are you actually prepared#
Why?  You're a nothing, nobody!  Why?	You'd never understand!
Oh, caught a few, lost a few.	Story of my life.  Well, one thing you won't lose is that friend of yours back there, I'll tell you that.
Video lock.	You got thirty minutes.
Hit it#	#now!
Thanks. 	It must've happened right after we left.
What the hell are you talkin' about#	#colonel?
Let me see your#	#hands!
  All right.	I'll lead 'em out.
Okay, doc.	The usual.  Doc.
Look at that.	Heat's murder.
How did she get that idea?	I think I gave it to her.
Fine, as long as you don't serve chicken that way.	Tell me. What do the police say?
I'd like you to look at something, Mr. Cross.	What is it?
How much are you worth?	I have no idea. How much do you want?
She's just no good.	What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right.
They don't kill a guy for that.	Oh they don't?
#No#	You bet your ass you don't. You can't even pay me off.
Then what'll you do?	Sue the shit out of 'em.
That's just lovely.	Thank you#
You've done well by yourself.	I get by.
Congratulations.	Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
I don't want it anymore.	No?
What are you doing here?	Didn't you call?
Isn't that your number?	Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
Yeah, I took 'em. So what?	How did she#  #happen to have them?
What are you talking about?	C'mon I'll show you.
It's too late.	Too late for what?
I know what he says.	Shut up.  Go on.
I don't suppose you got any idea Where she went?	Matter of fact I do.
That's it?	Yeah.
Who is he, get his name? I'll kill him.	Take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident.
No.	Do you know where she might be?
Would you like something to drink?	What are you having?
Thank you for going along with me. I just didn't want to explain anything# I'll send you a check.	A check?
Is there anything else you want to know?	Where you were when your husband died.
How did it happen?	Been meaning to talk to you about that.
We got it. We got it, baby.	What? What is it?
I'll stay.	Get in the car.
Boy oh boy, you're a mess.	Yeah.
Hold still. Why?	You can't always tell what's going on there.
What's wrong?	Your eye.
Where?	Just# I have to.
What did he say?  What did he say?	That you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.
Okay, give me the keys.	You bastard.
She's too upset.	What about?
Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police. I don't care what you've done. I'm not going to hurt you, but one way or another I'm going to know.	You won't go to the police if I tell you?
Did you get some sleep?	Sure.
I said the truth!	She's my sister.
I said I want the truth.	She's my sister and my daughter!
Yeah# where are you taking her now?	Back to Mexico.
Let me handle that.	I'm all right.
I'm sorry. We don't.	Don't be sorry, neither does Dad. Wanted to make sure though, didn't we, honey?
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.	Oh, good.
Mind if I take one of your cards? In case I want to get in touch with you again.	Help yourself.
You're a married man, am I right?	Yes#
The water.	What about the water?
Yeah?# I do?	Sure you do.
No, really?	I'm afraid so.
What's that, pal?	Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
Not exactly.	But that's what you told your wife.
What are you doing here?	I bought a ticket. I've come to see the film. 
Yes, it's a girl I saw at the station.	What's she like? What's she like?#
Did you ever see her again? 	No. And nobody knows where she is.
I don't care. I'll wait.	For what?
You have a great future as a driver. If they don't arrest you first!!	That's nothing to do with it, it's the car that's still being run in#
You're still beautiful#	Don't be silly#I'm old.  Don't look at me like that, please.  Why'd you come back?
Daddy's not coming back#He's dead. 	It's not true! No! It's not true!!! I'll show you he's coming back!
That's fine, Mr. Kane.	I rather like it myself.  Send it right away.
He sure did, Mr. Kane.	Where is he?
Hey, Brad!  Brad!  He ain't been drinking before, Mr. Kane. Never.  We would have heard.	What does it say there?
It's wonderful, Mr. Kane.  Wonderful. Wonderful.	You don't really think so?
Yes.  I thought it was a good idea. We've covered it from the news end, of course.	And the social.  How about the music notice?  You got that in?
We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes.	It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -
Isn't it wonderful?  Such a party!	Yes.
Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!	We've got a nice plant here.
What do you expect me to do?  What in the world -	Charles.
Oh yes, there is.	I don't think so.  Are you coming, Charles?
Charlie, you're just excited.  You don't realize -	I know exactly what I'm doing.  Get out!
Get out, both of you!	Charlie, please don't -
A chicken?	No.  But you're close.
Yes -	As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
Charlie!  I said, what time is it?	Half past eleven.
You'll never have another chance to hit me again.  I never knew till this minute -	Susan, it seems to me -
I won't let you go.	You can't stop me.
Goodbye, Charlie.	Don't go, Susan.
You goin', Mom?	Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
Mrs. Kane would like to see you, Mr. Kane.	All right.
Yes, Mr. Kane.	Not my wife - not either of them.
Oh, yes, sir.	Do you know what that is?
Tired?	It's been a tough day.
Say, Brad.  I've got an idea.	Yes?
First of all - 	What's wrong, Brad?
Charlie, it's just no go.  We can't agree anymore.  I wish you'd let me go to Chicago.	Why, Brad?
All right.	She's going to leave you -
She can leave me.  As a matter of fact, I've already left her.  Don't worry, Brad - I'll live.	I know you will.
Hello, Brad.	Hello, Charlie -  I didn't know we were speaking.
Maybe we'd better wait for more word on the President's condition.	What do you mean by that?
I'll sign those papers -	You people seem to forget that I'm the boy's father.
Who told you you could sit down here?	Oh!  I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
How do you want to handle the whole thing - ask questions?	I'd rather you just talked.  Anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and Mr. Kane.
In case you've never heard of how I lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me -	The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
Are you sure?	Am I sure?
Pack of cigarettes.  What's that?	This? How long have you been smoking?
Thanks. Have a good one.	Do you mind if I drink this here?
Maybe you should take that coffee outside.	No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
I was here the whole time.	You two better quit it.
Why?	No, don't!
When did you get back?	Just now.
How'd you get here so fast?	I left like an hour ago.
Promise me it'll always be like that.	Like what?
And the fact that there weren't any lights made it so#  God! That was so great!	It wasn't me.
I'm serious.	We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?
Stop this. This isn't funny.	I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside.
Are you sure somebody was back there?	I didn't just fuck myself! Jesus, I'm going to be sick!
I don't know. He just came in and asked to use the bathroom.	What time was this?
Wait a second? Who was working here today?	Just me.
Are you open?	Yeah.
This is the last time I come to this place.	Excuse me?
What the fuck is this?! I want some service!	In a second!
That's easy to say from over here.	Give me a stick, pretty boy! I'll knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass.
Are you open?	Yes.
Excuse me, do you have#	To the back, above the oil.  How long are you staying?
Pack of cigarettes.	What's your point?
You open?	Yeah.
Shit!	We get# what# twelve minutes of game, and it's over? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!!  I'm not even supposed to be here today!
What's he looking for?	He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
No.	Why not?
Are you gonna lock the store?	I don't know. You going to lock the video store?
You were saying?	Thanks for putting me in a tough spot. You're a good friend.
I could never reach.	Reach what?
I know it was a bad idea to close the store.	Listen to you.
I can't fucking believe you!!	I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
What's that for?	You work in a video store!
She said she did all the work.	WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?  WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM?
Around three or something.	What time did we go to the funeral?
What? What's with you? You haven't said anything for like twenty minutes. What the hell is your problem?	This life.
That's all bullshit. You know what the real problem here is?	I was born.
I threw out the stuff that got broken. The floor looks clean.	You need a ride?
Do you work tomorrow?	Same time. What about you?
Are you open?	Yes.
What? When? When did all this shit happen?	Hey man, that was a long time ago. Don't let it get to you.
Be careful.	I'm trying.
Say, young fella, you know I hate to bother you again, but can I take a paper or something back there# to read?  It usually takes me a while, and I like to read while it's going on.	Jesus# go ahead.
What? What is that?	She called you, didn't she?
What the hell was that for?	You're a pig.
You open?	Yes.  I'm not out of shape.
Were you working here at about four o'clock?	I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why?
I'm not out of shape!	Can I have your name please?
Here you go.	What's this?
What did he say?	I don't know, man. He's a fucking character.
Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape?	I don't know. I can't really tell from here.
Sure. How about the beach?	I like the way you think.
I just held up the same two movies. You're not even paying attention.	No, I wasn't.
Well this is the last time I ever rent here#	You'll be missed.
That's the price, my brother.	Yo, I don't have that kind of cash.
Work!  Don't say that word, man.	Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
"It's a perfect day for a monster jump."  Hey man, can you like do me a favor?	What?
Did I hear somethin' break? Outside left!	Fuck you.
I'm coming out!	No, stay off the line!  You'll break her loose!
She's losing it!	Sarah, hold on, he'll have you in a second.  Jesus Christ, grab her!
No, buddy, it was you who dropped it!	If you want, do it.  I don't care.
Forget me.  If you can, get away.	Would you?
Thanks for staying around when you didn't have to.	My pleasure.
What are we going to do?	Give him the money.
I'm going with you.	Not on that leg.
How're ya feeling?	Fine, I guess#
She's tough.	Is it really four thousand?
There you go.	One#
Two#	That's it, you look like a professional.
Four#five#	Nice and easy#
Please -- oh, no -- please!	I'm here!  Sarah, I'm here!  I'm here--I've got you!
Use your other hand!  Grab it!	Help me!  I don't want to die!
Can't do it?  I don't believe this.  Don't you feel anything?	I only came back for you.
Why can't things stay the way they are#everything has to change.  What we had was perfect.	I don't know.  Here, lay down and get some rest.  We're going to need it.
We have to get through to the other side.  You up for it?	I've gone this far, and right now I think I'm in better shape than you.
What was God thinking when he built this place?	If we don't get out of here soon we can ask him in person.
Can you see light?	Up ahead.
Pull it apart!	What?
Reach up!  Do it!	Don't let me fall!
Thanks for holding on.	We were going together before I ever let go of you.
What's he doing?	The best he can since you gave him nothing.
For Christ's sake, they're kids.	We're not animals, but don't force us to be.  Walk over.
You son of a bitch!  You said you wouldn't kill him!	Sue me.
You said there was a way across.	There is.
Yeah#	Anyone else following?
Then where the fuck is!	There.  You blind?
Go after her.	Hold on, baby, he'll get you.
Right.	Then it's a deal.
Why didn't you send the money over?	Somehow I didn't think you'd wait for me if I'd sent it first.
Don't use my name!	Ask the questions.
Don't give him anything.	We agree on something.  And for insurance, take his coat.
I don't trust him.	Kill him when he gets down.
Bring down the money or your friend's dead!	We can't and he knows it.
He's alive!	He can't be far away.  Find him. Go!
Good evening, sir.	Good evening.
I'm so pleased you appreciate good wine. Have another glass!	Thank you, sir.
Hi, hi, hi there, at last we meet.	What the bloody hell d'you think you're doing?
So this is the young man?	How do you do, sir?
Who said that?	I did, sir.
Thank you very much for this chance, sir.	Let's hope you make the most of it, my boy.
How are you feeling today?	Fine. Fine.
D'you think we should do something?	Would you like me to make you a nice cup of tea, son?
Shall we go to my office?	Thank you.
Go ahead, say it.	No.  I got lucky with the lights.
No, no way, I couldn't take that#	Yes, you could.  I think you need it more than I do.  It'll help.  I promise.
Thanks for everything, Max.  Wow#	Sure thing.
Annie#it's Max.	Max#
#okay, Max, I believe you#I'll get out of the building#	No, no, wait#
No.	Oh, my, yes.
And here I was thinking you were such a nice guy.	I am a nice guy, Daniel.  With a job to do.  You know how it is.
What?	I think#  #I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
Remember that thing a few years back? That thing with the cab?	What thing?
Why didn't you tell me we had company?  And what's your name?	No harm done, ma'am.
I was with Max when he got the call.	And you came all the way down here to see me?
I'm in town for a short time.	Try?
Hi, Ma.	I've been calling and calling.
You're kidding me.	I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
I know you're out there!  Answer the goddamn call!	What happens if you don't?
Hello?	Oh.  Sorry.
Uh, let's go to#  Hello#?	Yeah, yeah, sorry#
We have a deal.  What's your name?	Max.
You cool, Max?  Say "I'm cool."	You're cool.
Good.  Help me out here.	With what?
Got it?	Yeah.
Uh, look#why don't you just take the car#	#and you promise you'll never tell anybody about this, right?  Get in the fucking car.
Max.  May we leave the scene of the crime now, please.	I'm trying#
Max.	It's not me.
You listening to me?	Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
What about that?	I tried it.
Try some deep breathing.	What?
You better?	I think so.
What are you doing?	It's a mess.
Are you breathing?	Yes.
Music.	Play music.
Get rid of 'em.	How?
That one's probably married.  Think of his kids.  His wife's pregnant#	I'll deal with it.  I will, I will#
Hands on the wheel.  Ten and two o'clock, like they taught you in driver's ed.	Why?
Don't take that.  Tell him to shut the fuck up.	I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.
Let's go.	No.
Max?  What are you doing?	Leave me alone.
Show up for what?	Tell her I can't see her tonight, okay?
Show up for what?	She's in the hospital.
You take one more step, I'll kill her.	You'd do her a favor.
How long have you been a hit man?	Why?
Would you have called her?	Who?
Max?	Let her go.
They said send you downstairs.	Who?
The sound of love.	Excuse me?
I never told her.	Why the hell not?
Are you crazy?!	The guy came right at us!
I was only going one way.	Drop me off here!
I still don't see what it has to do with the President.	Do you still ride?
I bit the bastard's nose off.	You bit someone's nose off?
What's the charge?	You were there, Jerry.  Figure it out.
Hey#  I can't control it.  It's just, something that happened.	What is?
I won't be here when you get back, but I'll be in touch.  And thanks.	For what?
Lucky guess# Um, I'd feel a lot less naked if we could get outta here.	Don't tell me you're naked back there.
What took so long?  You were in there all day.	That's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out.  A lot of people are after you, Jerry.
You have the right to ask me certain personal questions?	Yeah.  I think so.
That's it?	I have no idea.
You want something to drink?	Um, coffee.  If that's okay?
Was that who I thought it was?	Uh huh.
Did you see the van back there?	What van?
I don't know what to say.  I love you.	What?
You look great.	Thanks.
Are you okay?  I wish I hadn't told you what I did.  But I can't help the way I feel.  You don't hold that against me, do you?	No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?
Now what?	This way.
After you.  It's okay.  I'm the one who left it here.	Where are we going, Jerry?
My father's house.	Come on.
Jerry.  Please.  You don't understand.  I have to know.  It's all I think about.  Do you have any idea what it's like not to know?	Yeah.  I know what it's like.
Why not, Jerry?	Because he believed me.
How'd you get the picture?	Your father, he was dying.  He was worried about you.  He took your picture out to look at it.  He called you his baby.
I believe you.	You do?
Blue moon# Blue moon#	Jerry#?  Jerry.
Blue moon#	You saw me standing alone #
Without a song in my heart.	Without a love of my own.
Blue moon#	You knew just what I was there for.
Don't die on me, Jerry.  Okay?	I can't promise you anything.
You've been my best friend for years and I didn't even know you were out there.	Top pocket#  Go on.
I love you, too.	Now she tells me.
Do I know you?	Yes you do, Jerry.  Quite well.
I'm a very patient man.	That's great.  Good for you.
Thank you.	You're welcome.  Where's my partner?
Can I ask you something?	A dog bit it.
Jerry told me he bit your nose.	And what did I say?
I'm still listening.	Jerry is dangerous.  Jerry has killed --
Where'd you get it?	You do recognize it then?
So, you doing anything tonight?	Working.
Yes.	Then this is a goddamn emergency.
Which way did he go?	I don't know.  Didn't see him.
Can I talk to you a second?	Go ahead.  We'll be right down.
Do you believe me?	Yeah, I do.
What gave me away?	Nothing.  I was just making sure. So, who are you?
Nothing.  Okay.  Some of us have been a little# not concerned, exactly, but#	Tell me.
You#	Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.
You aren't staying?	This# seemed best.
Please answer the question, Doctor.	Is it possible.  Yes.  But --
Talk to him.	But what do I say?
Time to sleep now, Captain.  But you can ask more questions in the morning, okay?	Okay.
I used# I used to dream you were alive# and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.	I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
It's time to go home now.	No.  Please.
Someone tell me this is really happening.	It's really happening.
And you believe this law with all your heart and soul.	And mind, yes.  What are you --
I read your book.	Really.
What#?	I'm sorry.
Hi.	Hi.
Oh my God#	What is it?
Well.  That would seem to decide it. Like it or not, for the moment, anyway, it looks like we're all in this together.	But --
Yeah.	What are you doin' here?
Tell us about it.	You steal a car?
Comin' out here, Boss?	Yeah. Come on out, Luke.
Then how come it ain't done yet?	I don't know, Boss.
You got your mind right, Luke?	Yes, Boss. I got it right.
Luke, you run again and we'll kill you.	I know, I know. Just don't hit me.
Oh, man, did you see her? Did you see her?	I got eyes, don't I? How my not gonna see something like that?
Lemme see it!	Get away!
Somebody say somethin'?	I didn't say nothin', Boss.
I'm gonna kill you, you go on#	That's what you're gonna have to do.
Where'd the road go?	That's it. That's the end.
What's the writing say?	Dear Boys. Playing it cool. Wish you were here. Love, Cool Hand Luke.
Oh Lord!	That fool. That damn fool.
One, two, three# 	He's gonna lose a finger eating eggs like that.
Stop that.	How about you tryin' to make me?
He'll never make it.	What are you talking about?
I hate this#	Only kidding!
Now look what you did.	What did I do?
Oh, God.  I must have looked horrible.	No, dear.  You're at your best with a bag in front of your face.
When are you going to call them?	About what?
You're fired.	I know.  Do come and meet your guest.
You bastard!	But alive!
She just got to sleep.  Do you have to tell her about it now?	Tell her about what?
For God's sake Peter, leave her out of it.  You don't want her, you want me.	I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then#
Yes.  I do.  I want it to end now. Let her go.  I'll come -- just let her go.  She's not important.	You know where.
Kill me, Peter, do it, now.	No.  Not yet.
I'm going to put a guard on your door.	One officer already got killed trying to protect me.  Please, just take it all away.  Leave me alone.
We've got another one.	That's no surprise.
Is that it?	That's exactly# I could have taken that same picture, this morning.
Why can't I drive home?  I will. You.  Look at you.  You need a ride home.  And you don't even know it.	Well, thanks.
Tell me what to do!	I'm falling!  I'm going to fall!
Don't let go# I can't breathe# I'll die!	Shhh.  It's okay.  Just breathe. I'll fix it#
It's a woman shot in a car?	Yes.  I have to go#
Don't hang up!	What?#
Open the door.  Please.	Why don't you shoot off the lock?
He was in my apartment!	I know, baby.  I know.
You know how to use this?	They taught me at the FBI.  I was very good at it.  It scared me# I liked it.
I was.	I'm over here?  What's your name, Officer?
Whatever it is, I'm gonna find out and sooner is a hell of lot better than later.	Well, there's something missing in there.  There was something around her neck when I came in there, but it's gone now.
Working late.  You're a damn fool.	Oh, I know.
Answer it.	I'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't you at least interested in which one it is?
Absolutely.	My promise.
There, that's better.	Thank you.
That's going well, then.	Well, yes.  You're getting out of bed tomorrow. They want you to walk.
I thought that was you, up there.	My last lesson's next week.  James# my car#
I think he'll be waiting for us at the airport	James.
You haven't told me where we're going.	Haven't I? To the airport, if you could.
Are we allowed to park here?	No.
Can you drive?	I can drive.
What does he want from you?	Hard to say.
First you tell me to do what I want to, then you tell me to stop.	All I want you to do is think about what's best for you. Really think about it.
What's up with you?	Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.
Just go ahead and tell us.	There's nothing to tell.
What do you think of this one?	I'd have to see it on.
What about this one?	You look beautiful.
Hi, Mom.	Look, Mom, I think I've found the dress.
Fuck me.	What's the matter?
How wonderful, darling.  What does that mean for you?	I'll be running it three days a week, and#
Are you sure, Dear?	Come on.
Oh no.	Paul could pop the question at any time.
I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. It's going to be OK.	I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'll see you soon.	Tomorrow?
It's so good to see you, Sweetheart.	You too, Mom.
Which flowers did you order?	We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too.
I'm only looking out for you.	And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke.
Mom, we agreed. You can visit, but you're not allowed to mention Michael.	Not even if it's something positive?
I'm really not that hungry.	Just eat whatever you want. This will give you a chance to meet some people.
It had this red spot on its back.	Green spot.
I don't mean to go on and on like this.	It's OK.   It's good to let it out.
You can only do what feels best to you now.	I guess so. I think that's right.
Chair, cup and ball.	Terrific.
A while, I guess.	That must be really difficult.
Don't take it personally.	You have no right, no right to take the worst thing that's ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game.
What are you looking to read?	Anything interesting.
What have you done with the ring?	It's magic.
Really, this isn't funny.	OK, OK, I'll give it back.
For a price.	Good God.
We're supposed to be asleep.	Exactly.
I'm not allowed to see you anymore.	Really?    Me too.
Then it's over.	Lie down.
It's a good thing my family loves you.	Your family just met me.
Well?	Home free.
Wow.	You like it?
It's TV heaven.	I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.
You've got to see the kitchen first.	Do you like it?
Hey.	It's sex time.
Good luck.	You, too. Kick ass today.
The store was busy.	You got wine. That's great.
You're going to miss the Top Ten.	Coming.
How may I help you?	Congratulations.
Something like that.	When he could get time off from the restaurant business.
What is it? Are you OK?	Always the drugs.
Silly?   Silly am I?	Michael, take it easy.
Don't upset my Mom.     Don't you upset my Mom.	Michael, calm down. Please. It's OK.
I guess we need to talk.	I guess so.
I sure know what that feels like.	And all the plans we have.
I'm sorry.     I didn't come here to blame you.	I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
What are we going to do?	What do you want to do?
Don't you have a magic trick or something to make this easier?	How about something better?   Like a kiss.
Would that really be such a good idea for either of us?	Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
I guess I should go now.	You should go.
What are you doing?    You're going to be late.	I'm calling in sick.
Of course not, no.  Is that why you're here?	I think we need to talk about some things.
No.	Especially this last year.
No, you've done a perfect job.	So, what do you say, Let?
You what?	I don't mean to hurt you.    I know this is a terrible thing.    And I have really loved you.
I'm glad you agreed to see me.	I'm just glad there aren't any hard feelings.
Getting back.	I heard about your friend.
Our relationship meant a lot to me, too, Paul. But it's over.  And Michael being in the hospital doesn't really change things.	I think I've heard this speech before.
Okay.   Okay.    I believe you.	You killed her!
Zero.   That's all I know.	You'll never get out of the city.
Hey man, you can't do that!	What?   This?
Hey Daniel! Hello?  Do you guys speak English?	Uh, yeah.
Hello?	It's Daniel.
Can I offer you something.    A drink? Coffee?	No thank you.
They knew who you were when they broke in your house?	Yes.
And for my help I would get what?	Half the tapes.
Tonight?	I know they won't be home tonight.
I don't know.	If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again.
Yeah.   We just go home.	We can't.
Get that, will you?	Why do I always have to answer the phone?
I just want you there in case there's trouble.	And if there is, then Zero can kill someone?
You think it's smart to tell him we're French?	I think he's already figured that out.
Fuck you! You know I'd never go along with something like this.	Do I?
We still have to get out of here.	Maybe if we gave the tapes back --
This is Zero.	Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five.
We've got to be careful not to use our real names while we're in here.	Good idea.
They'll be waiting for us at the airport.	You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
It's not your fault, Daniel.	No?
Anybody hungry?	What'd you get?
Yeah?	It's me.
There's ten grand in here. It's yours. I'm going to call you again. There's one more thing I need you to do.	What?
Okay, we're square now, right?	There's just one more thing I need you to do.
They were all French guys.	French guys?    You mean like from France?
But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss.	Oh, I'm sorry.
The map said to go left.	Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
What do we do?	I was told to take what we have and go.
They don't have a wine list.	Oh, then we will have the house wine.
They don't serve wine here.	What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
I don't know.     Maybe if we did just leave --	C'mon, get real, will you. You think he's just going to forget about this? These guys are all about respect. All about honor. He's coming after us, so we might as well take the money.
I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I ever listen to myself?	Yeah, but you did do it.   So let's deal with that.
This is bad. This is really fuckin' bad. Am I the only one who sees how bad this is?	Hey, it's not your picture on the TV, it's mine. So, try to be cool.
I am not comfortable with this.   I'm not a good liar.	Relax. It will be fine.
I'll drive.	I'm the driver.
When we get to the next corner jump out.	I'm not going to leave you.
You guys used to work together?	Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself.
It's good.	God, I want to go home.
Fine. All of you want to be angry? Be angry# but I'm the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.	No.
Who is closer to the wall, Joey or me?	Get in the car.
What happened?	They sort of got away.
Anybody know about that car outside?	Yeah.   It's mine.
How are we going to do that?	I know where she went.
I think we went the wrong way.	Oh, you think?
Holy shit.	What?
How do we know what room she's in?	Wait here.
And how do we do that?	I don't know.
When do we go?	Tonight.
You like shoes?	No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
Who's gonna see it there?	The lucky ones.
Can't sleep?	No.
Who are you waiting for?	Stick around and find out.
So, I just come by to see how you're doin'?	You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
What's this?	A car.
She's crazy.  You should have killed her.	I didn't have the heart.
Who are you?	Wait!  I'm a friend!
Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword?	I do as I please.
Where's your master?	What's it to you?
Do you think you are a real master?	Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword.  All of it is simply a state of mind.
Hello.  What is your name?	Long.
I've missed you.	How so?
What do you want?	What I've always wanted, to teach you.
Let's stop a moment.	Give it back!
Keep it safe.  Return it to me when we are together again.	I will.
They're gone.	What does it say?
And you're gonna tell me who.	Who ever made that.
Whatever it is, the answer's no, Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.	Annie, I need a file.
Don't thank me.  Your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit.	I knew that.
And I say I'm dead# and I move.	No further.  I'm serious.
You, my friend, are dead.  I saw your body.  You got buried.	I saw it, too.
You died, man.  I can't believe it but here you are.  Last year, you and your girlfriend --	I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
My name.	I'm sorry as hell, man.
Mom --?	I told you you're not supposed to come in here.
Oh wow, oh wow, don't fucking do that, man.  I nearly had a fucking heart attack.	Fun -- look at that guy#
My mom works over there.  I'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now.	Who?
Do you feel okay.	No.
I know your friend, too -- the one that looks like a rock star.	I don't know you.
How the hell did you do that?	Magic.
Neither.	Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.
Get it?	Leave me alone -- !
You'll be alone.	I'm already alone.
Don't waste my time.	Very well, it's your ass.
We've got company.	Is he inside?
I've got him if you want him.	No shooting.
Have we met?	I don't think so.
Are you okay?	I'll be fine.
You promise not to say anything?	On my mother's life.
So what year are you going into?	Junior.
Excuse me. Excuse me!	You talking to me?
I'm sorry, but you're not my type.	Fine. Friends it is. I can live with that.
You're naked.	It's my house.
Need a lift?	No thank you.
It was fine.	I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?	It's not about being happy. You and I can't -
No, not at all.	Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.
Well, I was just calling to tell you I was thinking about you and I miss you. I'll let you go.	Wait, don't hang up.
Sure. Have a good night.	I will.
It's weird. I actually feel good about myself. Can we do this again next week?	Oh please.
That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad person.	Yes it does.
You know what? I don't take it back.	Why are you doing this?
You really want to know?	Yes.
I just came to say goodbye.	Where are you going?
Please don't go.	Get off me.
Hi.	Hi.
I'm fine. I have to get going to my friends' house.  Was it --	It was perfect.
Hi.	Hi.
This isn't working out for me anymore.	Yeah, me neither.
It's not you, it's me. I'm completely fucked up.	What are you saying?
Why are you trying to hurt me?	I'm just being honest. I just wanted to see what you were like in bed.
Oh, I suck. I suck.	Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath.
Are you for real?	Do you want to learn or not?
See that wasn't so bad.	It was nothing.
Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never.	Okay.
Calm down. Tell me what's wrong.	Something awful happened last night.
It's like a secret society.	That's one way of looking at it.
Excellent.	You think he'll like it?
I'm sorry that was out of line.	I want to go home.
Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom and have her come pick you up.	My mom? Don't call my mom.
Just a kiss, right?	I swear.
What are you doing?	You promised to let me kiss you.
You think?	Is it me?
Where are you going?	I'm taking a shower.
Jesus. We've been at this for six months.	I know.
Hi, mom.	Honey, is something wrong?
He told me he loved me and I believed him.	Who told you?
Oh baby# oh baby#	Baby?  Right on time.
Whoa!	I told you to lock the door.
Positive.	Did you do everything I asked you to?
Is she with you?	Who is this?
Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you.	What?
You can put it anywhere.	Even there?
Fuck her yet?	I'm working on it.
You would not believe what--	Shhh.
Before we go through with this, I just want you to be aware of the damage we're going to cause.	I'm aware.
That her?	Yeah.
Shut up.	What's your problem?
Morning!	Morning.
Bad time?	Kind of.
You didn't?	Oh yes.
Some other time.	Excuse me?
Why so nervous?	I've never done this before.
Well done.	Thank you. Now, where were we?
Get off me!	Will you calm down?
I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.	I accept. Now get out.
I got your message and came as quick as I could.	I hope I didn't keep you from something.
Let me get that for you.	Oh please. I can't have you do that.
Who the hell do you think you are?!	Excuse me.
I'll do that.	It's really important.
Did I ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me -	Yes, you already did.
I said, do you want some water?	Oh# no thank you#
What time is it?	Eight o'clock. You got to go.
Wow. I never knew she had these kind of feelings.	You're a lucky guy.
I'm so glad to have met you at last. You're just as nice as Amy told me you were.  I hope you'll come to see us.	I'd love to.
Mommy --	Yes, darling.
Someone gave it to you? Where was this old house?	On the back street a green house
Where'd you get this, darling?	It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
Oh, thank you, darling.	You can't open it yet. You have to put all of them under the tree until morning.
Why don't you take off your hat and stay awhile?	I forgot I had it on.
Where is everybody?	It's early yet.
Did you hear the child out?	Well, it seemed to me --
What is it, Alice?	I thought Amy was calling. I guess not.
I haven't had my breakfast.	Well, you know where it is.
Amy, not that old tree!	Yes, daddy.
What do you want. Amy?	I wanted to talk to you,  I wanted to tell you about the other children.
What do you mean you didn't play with the other children?	It was on account of the birthday party.
Now Amy	It's true.
I'm sorry. Daddy and Mommy are a little upset.	You're upset about me -- I made you fight --I hate for you to fight.
These are all from me.	This one says, "To Mother from Amy."
Daddy!	Yes, Amy?
Amy, answer me. Why did you call her your friend?	Because she is my friend.
She's there, just like I said she'd be.	Where, Amy? Where do you see her?
Yes, she was afraid. She said there was someone who wanted to kill me.	But there's no one here, darling.
Daddy?	Yes, darling.
What'd you get for Christmas?	I don't know yet.
Who are you?	You called me by my name.
You'll always play with me?	Whenever you want.
No, I don't think that's very much fun. Let's play house instead.  You be the friend who comes to see me.  I'll show you my children.	Your children?
You mustn't be afraid.	But she's dead!
You?	Yes, Amy.
What?	Don't you hear it?
Hide me? Why?	My little girl said she'd kill you if you came to see me. I can't let you die. We'll have to hide you.
Hurry, hurry.	Yes, yes -
Hurry!	I can't do it! I can't do it!
You didn't even open my present and I'm your daughter.	My daughter died long ago.
Oh, doesn't that prove something to you? Doesn't it?	Anybody could know that song.
Let the child stay.	Now, I don't know Amy --
There's a present you haven't opened yet, ma'am.	That's from her -- that woman.
It's some animal hurt in the woods that made that sound.	Wait a minute. Listen.
Amy looks happy seems almost as if she were playing with another child; like somebody else were running with her and playing.	I like to see her happy.
It all starts with them going to the bathroom together.	That many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that.
Sorry I didn't recognize you earlier. You look so different.	I've changed a lot lately.
Wow your body's really hot.	I've been working out.
Do you really need these?	Only to see.
Or if there's a full moon.	Or if your boyfriend's an asshole.
I think she broke the skin.	What a bitch. You should see a doctor. That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the emergency room.
So did you do it?	Did I kill him? Of course not!
What did he say?	I think he called you beautiful.
Get rid of him!	Okay, I gotta go.
Holy shit, I don't know.	Did you get rid of Mark?
You expecting someone?	No.
Fuck it's the cops. Peter saw me, now I have to let him in.	Tell them you'll meet them outside.
What the fuck are we going to do?	Hide him.
Peter knows something.	Well if he does, he didn't give you away. He must really like you.
I know.	So you're Grant's secretary?
You're kidding, really?	No, I'm serious. How about we have dinner and I tell you about it?
What, you got a date or somethin'?	Since when do you care?
You look different. I mean you look good.	You never say that.
Look what you did!	Oh my god, I'm sorry!
It's a matter of life and death.	This really isn't a good time.
Mark.	Yeah?
Wow.	Take your shower.
You busted me.	Are you following me?
I really gotta get going.	Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could# get a bite sometime?
Except Mark of course.	What's that supposed to mean?
Is it that funny?	No, it's just# no one's ever said that. And I thought if someone did ever say it, I'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say "I love you too" cause they felt they had to after I'd said it.
You at least owe me the truth.	You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
How do you know?	I don't think you would. No matter what form you take.
Be careful!	Can't you bite me and then I'll be like you?
I knew you wouldn't kill me.	Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.
I'm going to take a shower.	Okay.
I ate a guy last night.	And how did you feel when you ate this guy?
Yes# I# we had dinner.	Did he come home with you? Did you go to his apartment?
A kiss? Did you have sex with him?	No, I said it was our first date.
No. We left the restaurant, and# and I felt sick# so# so I took a cab home. Alone.	You got a dog?
How the hell is that your business?	We're just trying to figure out what happened.
What?	And you think I'm sick?
He means the last that we know of.	This one walk you home too?
What's he doing here?	Says he is the man's doctor#  You know#
Police.  Nobody move.	He tried to kill me!
In there.	Just like that?
Was that for real down there?	I'm afraid so.
Good evening, sir.	Yes.  This way.
It seems fine.	Fine?  Look here!
Who is it?	Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.
Why give yourself up?	I  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  I thought maybe you know something#  I'm scared.
People#  after me.	Who?
Go on.	Well.  The only thing I've been certain of, all this time, is that I need to get to the ocean.  The point is no one seems to know how to get there.
What now?	This ocean business#  I know where I can find a map.  I need to go back to the station.  Where will you be?
Jesus!  We have to get you to a doctor#	No#  No doctor#
But#  How long has this been happening?	A few days#  a few weeks  -  dunno, I can't remember.  Worse thing is, I never know if it will change back again#  Now, please leave me alone.
Look!  This is a good one!	What is that door?
You see it?	Yes.
You remember nothing?  Who you are? What you've done?	You know something about me?
Bad dreams?	Yes.
If you like.	You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
Known me for long?	Well#
I cannot say#  You don't know the answer to that?	I told you, I can't remember a thing!
Horrible#	You remember nothing, eh?  Let me show you something.
Can I get my life back?	Maybe.
What are you doing?	I have to go#
You're a liar!	No, it's the truth.
It's a trick.	No it isn't.  You are doing it!  Now raise it over the glass and#
What are you hiding?	Nothing.  I don't know anything!
What is it?	We are#  living in their dreams#
I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like# Like you're telling me about somebody else's life#	It's the truth#  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
How do I get there?  Tell me.	That's easy.  You#
First Lady#	Don't worry.  You won't even see her.
Now, remember -- keep it simple.	Don't worry.
What's with her?	Don't worry about it.
Mr. President#	I mean,  if it's a problem#
What the hell is this?	What the hell is this ?
The Washington Post.	No#
.. Nothing.	Great.
You're nothing.  Do you understand me! You're NOBODY#	I'm# not# nobody#
# what?	I said you're fired.  Go on -- get outta here.
Oh# I'm fired?	Yeah.
You're fired.	Fine#
Fine?	Fine.
A condition#	Exactly. A condition.
We think so.	Yes.
Clean.	What do you mean, he's clean?
What about the wife?	Clean.
What are you gonna do?	I'm going to kill him.
It's not his job -- It's my job!	Bob#
What do you mean by that?	Just what you think I mean.
I'm serious, Dave -- you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this.	It's fine.
Thanks. You did great.  Maybe later you could come back and we could go to Camp David or something.	That'd be great.
Will he be alright?	Oh, yeah# probably#
No.	I'm afraid so.
You know, on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around#	I'm not sure# I might have.
Fine.	Fine.
Gimme a quarter.	What?
Let's call it a night.   I can't take any more.	Right.  We can pick up on the rest tomorrow.
Now he's making stuff up about me.	He's not.
Oh# Hi.	Dirty business we're in sometimes.
# Sometimes they do.	Yeah# Sometimes they do.
You ever think back to how you started.	What?
How'd you get started?	Oh# Kinda the same way.
Your government needs your help.	What?
So, how long have they been like that - - you know, him and the First Lady?	I can't say.
So you just protect the President the whole time?   That's your whole job?	Yeah.
You ever use it?	No.
I was waiting for that jack.	I had a feeling.
Well#	Well#
You sure you don't want a lift back home?	No thanks.  It's not that far.
You bet.	I'm outta here.
Don't you have anything to say to me?	Thanks for doing this, Ellen?
# . Ellen.	I saw the light.  I thought maybe you were up.
That was quite a thing you did today.	Anybody would have done it.
You're leaving?	I'm not the First Lady, anymore.  I shouldn't be here.
How were you gonna get home?	I don't know.  I hadn't thought it out that far.
You don't have to keep walking with me.   I'm okay from here.	I don't mind.
He said he'll pick it up in a couple of days.	Oh# Okay.
What?	It's just so strange#
I lock at you and I see Bill#  I mean, he's almost dead, but he's right here# I mean, you're right here# alive and#	I'm not Bill Mitchell.
In fact,  I'm not anything like him and# I guess I want you to know that.	He wasn't always like that, anyway.
Are you hungry?	What?
So what do you do the rest of the time?	You mean when I'm not running the country?
You know, Dave -- it is Dave, isn't it?  I can't keep all of this a secret.	I know.
What?	I can't.
What's wrong?	Looks like we're not going to get a chance to get much done.
Yeah.   He's a good man.	What?
Hi.	Hi.
I never thought I'd#	I know.
It could be fun.	Yeah# It could be fun.
Did you get someone to double for me there, out front?	We're working on it.
Help me get him to the boat.	Leave him.
It can't be. Are we truly in hell?	Come on.
Are you alright, Doc? You look# you look real bad.	I have looked bad for four years. Everyone in the world has looked bad for four years. Thank God looks don't matter as much as they once did.
What is it?	It's#he was#one who came to the island with me.
It's alright. I'm a friend. I need help and so do you. What's a safe place to talk?	Ain't no place safe.
I'm gonna have this stuff sent over to the hospital#	The hospital? 
He is dying. He knows it.	You are dying, too.
Mary.	I'll have somebody's ass for this. I'll have your ass, soldier. I'm not gonna stand here and#
You fired that shot, didn't you?	No, sir.
It's been fired.	In the battle, sir.
Sounds boring to me.	Don't come.
Why doesn't he let you do what you want?	Yeah!  Tell him off!  It couldn't get any worse.
How was dinner?	Terrible.  Awful!  I met the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life!
How'd it go?  Did you read it to her?	Yep.
What do you mean you don't know?	I'll tell you later.
All right.  I'll try anything once.	Except sex.
Oh God, it's over now!	Why? Nobody knows who we are.
It's such a strange name!  Won't you tell us what it means?	I told you, that's a secret.
I think he's sweet.	I think you're sweet.
Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do.  I'm just saying	Then don't tell me how to talk to my father when you're the same way.  All right?!
Who's in?	I'm in.
This is stupid.	It's better than doing nothing.
Don't stop.	Stop what?
Pleased to meet you.	The pleasure is mine.
That's your sister school, right?	Sort of.
Oh, hi.  I'm glad you made it.  Did you bring anybody?	No.
Of course I know you!  From the first time I saw you, I knew you had a wonderful soul.	Just like that?!  You just knew?
Oh Captain, My Captain, we came here so I could talk to you about something.	Okay.
What did your father say? Did you talk to him?	Yeah.
You really think I should forget her?	You have another choice.
All right!  What'd she say?	I don't know.
Where are you going?	I'm calling her!
You know me, always taking on too much.	Good boy.  Call us if you need anything.
Weird.	But different.
Look at this.	What is it?
So what do you think of my father?	I'll take him over mine.
Want to come to the study group?	Thanks but  I'd better do history.
What is it then?	I# I just don't want to come.
I've found it.	Found what?
By the way, there's a meeting this afternoon.  You coming?	I guess.
Visit from my father.	Do you have to quit the play?
You the Captain?	Yes.
It's not going to help us!	We're going to die here! We're going to die!
They are#they are everywhere.	All right, be cool, everybody, nice and slow, no sudden moves.
We don't even know if his boat is still there#you saw Billy!	Boat or no boat#I'm going#
Right here#middle of nowhere#and the answer to your question is yes.	Which question is that?
Where are my men?	Dead.
Maybe we lost them.	Or maybe we're exactly where they want us to be.
I'm not staying here!	It ain't any better out there!
Now look what you did!	I saved your life is what I did!
Hey! Hey! Where are you going?	#there's got to be a way to access out back there#
But what makes you think there aren't more of those#things#back there?	Nothing#you want to come, come# you don't#

Got it?	Hey! I didn't have to come back.
What's the matter?	The quiet#
Looking good#	You should talk#

Funny guy.	Fuck you - fuck you.
Hello Wade.	Out of the room.
What is it?  I'm about to go on.	We have to talk.
You were planning to send me back to the ice house.  You set me up.	You're crazy.
You have no evidence.  Arrest this man.	You want evidence.  I'll give you evidence.
You okay?	How do I look?
Sir---	Shut up!  Drop it.
Need help?	I got it.  I got it.
They're going to rob that bank.	How do you know?
Wanna come?	My insurance won't cover it.
Can I ask you something?	Yes.
Why?	I was set up.
She's pretty.	Thanks.
You need anything else?	I'll be okay.
I'll have a cup of coffee?	Never use it.  Stuff'll kill ya.
No.  I want to be with you.	No you don't.
You should be in hospital.	And you should be with your family.
You all right?	Yeah.
Bye.  Thanks.	Remember, get the seat fixed.
Hi.	Hi.
Funny.  Would you like to buy me a drink?	This little thing says I can't.
I'll take it.	No -- that's for me to do.
The people, Jabez -- the people.	The -- folks or people, what's the difference among friends?
Jabez -- ?	I've brought you something to keep you warm, Mrs. Stone --
That's my business. -- Now, it's all right, Daniel.  What did he do?	He lied to me again.
I see why you're here -- you knew that nobody was coming.	I didn't.
Hello, Colonel! Want a lift?	Well, I wouldn't mind.  But my name's Daniel Stone.
Gee -- that Fair --	It hasn't opened yet?
Daniel! Don't ever let me catch you doing that again!	Why? It don't hurt.
Daniel, you ought to be in bed.	No, no, I don't want to go to bed. I want to be here for the party.
Mama!	Daniel! # You must go to sleep.
Say # about the interest #	Now don't you worry about that. You just leave it all to me. We won't talk business now # just bear this in mind # I'm not the man to get rich on other people's hard luck#. No, sir# not me! #
Well -- we don't mean to force you, Jabez Stone -- but -- it's only for your own good.	I'll look out for myself! # Now go away -- leave me alone.
You're not -- Dorothy.	No. She's gone.
Good evening -- I'm sorry, Jabez -- I'm a little late.	No, you're not.
Now run along, Daniel.	What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
What's the matter with you?	You are afraid!
Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?	I'm through with you.
Well now, Mr. Stone, did you make up your mind?	About what?
You were worried, Jabez, weren't you?	Well, I --
Coming along, Jabez?	Shall we?
You keep that -- that's for you. I want you to talk up the party to make sure that the best folks really come.	You want me to go around --
Jabez -- help!	Coming.
I think his leg is broken.	Oh, Jabez.
Mary--	Jabez #
It feels fine now, Jabez.	Will you come into town with me tomorrow?
We must go on home, Jabez.	Yes, Mary.  It's been a long day.
But I'm glad to be home again --	Tired?
Mary --	Jabez --
Jabez -- once you said we'd never change --	I wasn't used to being big -- wasn't used to thinking in big ways. Now, I've made up my mind.
Mary --	Hello, Jabez --  Here's your son.
What happened#. Where are you taking him?	I am going to lock him up.
Jabez -- how can you let her talk like that when the boy is present? He won't respect me any more.	Isn't that your own fault?
Why don't they come --	I don't know, Jabez.
You must go now, Mary -- you must!	All right, Jabez #
Jabez -- Jabez!	Mary!
You know that, son.	Hard luck -- like me.
Ma -- is she? --	You'll be a father any minute now.
You go down and see what's keeping Dorothy.	Sure, Ma.
Well, I guess we won't be going to church today.	I guess we won't.
She'll do nothing of the kind! She's going to church with me, right away!	Jabez -- for the good of your soul # please come with us.
So you've made up your mind to go to the party.	You aren't angry with me?
Be sure to let me know if Daniel is over there.	I won't forget.
It is.	You've got a smart man, Mrs. Stone. Hang onto him.
There is nothing like a good old country breakfast. Where's Ma?	She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you.
Say, that's pretty good, young man.	Pretty good -- that's perfect!
The girl was off today.  Hey, I didn't expect you to sit up front.  So, your lady live out here?	The past six months.
She had a good job, it turned into a great career.	But meant her moving here.
How 'bout some Christmas music?	That is Christmas music.
One of yours?	No, sir.
What's happening?	They don't look happy#something's gone wrong.
Where are you going?	I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first# them#or your husband.  Hi there.
Then there's no reason not to tell it to us.	I told you#
Three down, four to go --	Then don't waste time talking to me.
I'll be a few minutes.  Wait here --	Don't I always?
Hey, I love you.  So do a lot of the guys.  So hang in there, man.  Hang in there.	Thanks#partner.
They way you drive, I can see why.	I#I shot a kid.
Al.  Man, you were my rock.  I couldn't have made it without you.	Bullshit.
What's going on?	What's it look like?  We're going in.
If you're right I'm gonna back you a hundred percent, you know that.	Fuck you, sir - if I'm right, I don't need you.  What I want is - if I make an honest mistake I want help.
Jesus, you're the man!	Come on, what's under this?
Aw, hey#	Come on, nobody's gonna get hurt. If they were gonna shoot, they'd shoot now.
Hey, don't take the car!	Well, how'll I get home?
Sonny, there's somebody under that desk over there# I'm sorry#	It's okay# it's okay#
I'll kiss the baby for you.	I love you.
Jesus Christ is coming back and he's really pissed.	Yeah, well I don't blame him.
Hello.  Hello, Leon.	Hello, Sonny.
So!  Sal is with you?	Sal?  Yeah# Sal is with me.
Yeah.	What are you doin' in there?
Okay, you're in there and we're out here.  What do we do now?	I told you -- keep away.  I don't know what we do now.
Right -- got ya.  Okay, so there's you -- what's your name?	What do you want to know that for?
You got these cops outta here. They're comin' in too close.	Come on.  I want you to see something.
What the hell you doin' back there?	Sonny, come on out!
What the fuck do you want?	They were #
Yeah?	We're bringing in your wife#
What's the matter with you?	Come on, lemme load you up#
This is it?  What am I gonna do with this?  Holy shit!	It's all we got.
The gun's right on your back#	Give me the keys#
Let's go to the back door.  How'd that guy get to be a guard?	Well, they go to guard school.
You got kids?	I got two kids # and I'd like to see them again.
What?	The TV # they want to talk to you #
Do you think we can turn it on?	I don't know.
I'm okay # I'm okay #	You know more than the Doctor? You're not okay, look at you.  Come on #  # let's get him out #

Nobody give their right name # it's the FBI!	I just want to see all you young ladies are all all right in here.
Wait a minute!  What the fuck you tryin' to tell me?	What I said.  You just sit quiet and we'll handle Sal.

I don't want him.	What can he do, he's clean#
Okay - you got your one.	You follow my car. 
Listen, we got young girls here# you could watch your language.	I speak what I feel.
What are you trying to pull?	I forgot she's in here.
Fuck!  We did it!	Goodbye, honey.  Wish us luck!
Why are you doing this?	Doing what?
Morning.	Morning.
Who the hell is that?	That's the crew. They follow us.
So what?	You know what I'm talking about, did you fuck her?
Did you get all four?	Yep.
God help us. God help us all.	It was the beginning of the end.
What did he say about the arm?	He said# take his right arm.
We are so fucked.	Then so be it. If you believe what that Indian said we were fucked either way.
We're covered on legal with that, right?	In theory.
You were good.	Real good.

I didn't know you had such beautiful hair.	Fool, there's a lot in this world you don't know.
Good morning.	Is it a good morning?
Where did you sleep?	I didn't.
Don't you have enough sense not to bother people when they're sleeping?	Wake up!
How come you're not at Sal's?	I'm working.
Hurry up and get dressed.	I'm coming.
No.	Yo, I'm gone.
I'll see you out.	See ya around.
How many you say?	Twenty!  Motherfucker!  Twenty!

Motherfucker wasn't saying shit.	Look at that.
It's a fucking shame.	What is?
Let it be broke.	Can ya dig it?
I didn't say nobody, I said you.	Sweet Dick, I didn't mean it like that.
Hey!  What did I say?	Who doesn't work?  Don't start no shit, won't be no shit.
Sal, can you do me a favor?	Depends.
Yeah, do you know 'em?	No, just checking.
I know I haven't seen you in four days.  I'm a working man.	I work too, but I still make time.
And I really wanted some ice cream too.	I can run out and get it.
Where are you going?	To get my money.
Act like one then.  Be a man.	Later.
You talk to 'em.	People are free to do what they wanna do.
I'll do that.	We're outta here.
I know this.	I love you.
Pop, I think we should sell this place, get outta here while we're still ahead#and alive.	Since when do you know what's best for us?
Pop asked you.	I'm gonna kill somebody today.
Take it easy, Pop.	Don't start on me today.
You're it.	Guys. Give me the two fifty and go away.
Yeah, we're closed. So go away.	Actually we have something for you.
Oh my god, are you alright?	Yeah, I think.
But I came here to learn about America.	Baby listen, there's nothing more American than not doing anything and getting away with it.
Excuse me?	Come over around seven.
Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you.	Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?
HARRY? Are you okay?	Are you kidding? I couldn't be more okay.
Okay.	Okay, what?
Is it true what you said to Captain Rob?	Yes, Harry. I can't home school you anymore. So maybe it's time to make some new friends, some friends your own age#
You're going to be just fine, HARRY.	I know I am, Mom.
Mom, you know that never works.	Right.
I think it's just over there.	Is that what I think it is?
You know, you're the first person I've brought here.	Oh, is this your special place?
Oh, yeah. Well I almost always beat Captain Rob.	Who's Captain Rob?
Whoa. What was that?	What?
HARRY.	You look familiar. Did I have your brother?
You're it.	Oh, no. You're not gettin' me again.
These are really cold, huh?	That's why you have to drink it fast, trust me.
What?	Our own special bus.
Nope. I was right.	Wanna bet?
Oh hey Lloyd, why are you here?	Just wanted to see how your doing.
HARRY, can you hear me?	Yes.
You have beautiful eyes.	You have beautiful eyes.
Hey, where did you come from?	Hey, where did you come from?
Sure, I like a woman with some meat on her bones.	So, have you given him "some" yet? 
HARRY, would you like to share with the rest of us what's so funny?	You wouldn't get it. Just a private joke between best friends.
No one knows?	Me, me, me!
By the way, did Captain Rob mention how I beat the crap out of him this afternoon?	No. What happened?
George Washington!	Who?
If you have to ask, you don't know.	Yeah, that's why I asked.
You're it.	Am not.
Hey, look. Ice cream.	You thinking what I'm thinking?
Wait, wait!	HARRY, are we gonna build this thing or not?
She's one of a kind.	Try one in a million!
Sorry, Charlie.	Hey, where'd you go?
So what did you say to my parents on the phone?	Not to expect you tonight.
Yes, what?	Don't answer me. Say what I say.
What are you doing here?	Checking up on my friend, Harry.
So, when can we do it?	Tomorrow night?
What are you doing?	Let's just do it and get out of here.
I'm so close I can feel it.	Me too. I'm almost there.
HARRY! Lloyd! You guys are a mess.	Looks like the best man won.
Hey you two. Lights out.	Hey can be on top?
Left here! Left!	You bet I left him, took the dog and we was history.
I am strong!	Yes you are. 
God, I've missed you.	And I you.
Times two.	I think you'll make a good teacher.
So far so good. We'll need more pictures. Why don't you take them on a field trip tomorrow.	And#?
Knock knock.	Who's there?
Oh, just like the President.	Just like the President.
This is horse?	No# no it's not horse, you see I sold the horse.
My thanks.	With your permission#
What's that you're saying?	Nothing.
Yes, my Lord.	We are alone#
Run!	I can't# I can't.
What's in the box?	Pain.
Your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. I only want to know one thing#. Do they come true?	Not all of them# I know which ones will.
Well he isn't# and he won't die# Tell me he won't die!	What can be done has been done.
Yes. Perhaps he would at that.	My father sent you to test me. Music then?
Say, that's a funny place to sleep.	It is my home.
Should I call a doctor?	Nah.  This happens all the time#
Goodbye!  Goodbye!	So how'd we do?
Eddie, this is quite a scene.	I know it's a lot to give you at the last second.
What are you doing?	I was thinking about killing myself.
Don't worry.	I'm sorry, Eddie.  I'm so sorry.
I've got some good news.  The doctor says you're all better.  You can come home.	Really?  I don't feel so great.
And, cut#	Eddie, how was I?
So guess where I'm going next weekend?	I don't know.  Where?
Which one is the red one?	What do you mean?
You really think so?	Absolutely!  It's just the beginning. I promise this: If we stick together, one day I'll make every single one of you famous.
Wow.	And who may you be?
Ed, I'm so proud!  I'll read it as soon as I get home.	Well, I'd really like to know what you think.  Why don't you go in the bedroom and take a look at it?  I'll Wait#
I'm no good.	Ed, it's just one man's opinion!
You're a fuckin' mess.	So WHAT??  Look, we gotta figure out where we're gonna stay.
Eddie, which dress do you like better?	I don't know.  Hey Bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one?
I kinda need it now.	What are you looking at me like that for?  I already gave you my three hundred.
Hmm, so you're in the picture business?	You could say that --
Excuse me, Sir#?	Yes?
Oh, it's you again.	Oh, hi.
You're not gonna believe the first picture I ever saw.  Your friend's.	What do you mean?
Does this mean you don't like sex with girls?	No! I love sex with girls.
Stop!	STOP!
Look, it's Dr. Tom.  Hey, Dr. Tom!	Who's Dr. Tom?
Ed, I'm so happy for you.	Let's get married.
You're sure this is gonna work?	Yes!
Yeah. I brought you some movies.	Anything good?
What do you love her or something?	Come on#
Have I ever said a bad word to you about your father?	No.
How's your mother?	Al!
You thought it was me?	Yes!
Are things gonna be okay with you and Mom? Is there anything I can --	I'm moving out.
Did you see that?	What?
You think she really likes him?	She doesn't give a shit about him.
Ed, can I see you a second.	Excuse me.
Yes, Ed.	Could we just talk alone for a second? I --
Yeah.	You asked me if I had a dream. I said "Sure, I have a dream. I just don't know what it is yet."
I don't think so.	Yeah. Because, you didn't talk me into anything. Everything you wanted me to do, I wanted to do.
He's who we want to go with.	This guy.
I thought -- I thought he was dead.	Who?
What?	Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married#
You know who we are?	Tell me.
Hey, if it's free, it's me.  You ready?	Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
Yeah.  Honey, if you're watching this is for you.	No! Don't --  Oh, wow.
Eddie? #	Yeah?
Ma, do you know where Ray is? I've been calling him and I'm getting his machine and --	Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend.
Oh my God. You and Al were - and that's why you threw him out.	He had a woman in my own bed! And how dare you call him "Dad" in front of Al.  This is your father. This is who was there for you when you needed someone.
Eddie#	Mom?
What happened?	It was horrible. He called me up.
What?	The doctor said you were having sex.
Don't tell Al. He doesn't know.	Well, he's the only one in America who doesn't!
Ed! How did you know I was here?	You're famous. Somebody called me. What are you doing in a place like this?
Right, yeah --	She really doesn't want you and the camera in here right now.
She won't.	What are you talking about?
Oh! Oh -- okay, now I get it. It's "Star Search." You wanted me here because the camera comes with me.	Ed, he needs a break. You don't know what kind of bad luck he's had --
Are you asking me?	No, I mean#
How much less?	Never would be plenty.
Um, yeah, I was gonna #	What's the deal? Did anybody make a decision -
Yeah#	I hear the dog really liked him.
You do though, you look great.	Right.
I mean bad.	Look, not having been there# I just think you're hurt and you're saying this to, you know, get back at him.
Really?	Yeah.
Oh my God.	It's# okay
What are you doing?	I missed you.
Um#	What?
I told you. If we# you know do it, they go away until # we're done.	I know, but even if they go away, everybody in America knows what we're doing because# they went away.
I need to talk.	Are you all right?
It's not their fault.	No. It's your fault.
What do you want me to do? You want me to quit the show?!	No# Could you?
This is going right up your ass.	Come on.
What's up?	Where were you?
You know, that would be like a great thing.	What?
I # I'm not gonna do it.	What?
You would do this? You would actually --	In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you something --
All right.	Yeah?!
I mean my question is what was she doing in a bar in the first place?	Ray --
What are you, hiding from the Police?  Show your face, you look great.  Doesn't she look great.	Great.
Who is it?	It's me, Ed.
# Ray?	Yeah.
Come on, Ma.	Let's remember how I got into this. "Please, Eddie, do this for me. I can't get a break." 
Hello.	Hi.
You don't recognize me.	No. Am I supposed to?
Who is it?	It's Ed.
That girl's an idiot.	What?# Why?
Hi.	Hi.
Oh, yeah, I love those. Yeah# those are funny#	Well, it was really nice meeting you and, uh#  I'd better get a cab.
Oh!!	We have to stop meeting like this.
Are you busy tomorrow night?	No.
It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.	Here, get down.
You gonna do it? You gonna do it?	Yeah, uh, just a minute
Yeah. No. I mean, you know.	What?
Having a problem with your eye there?	Dick.
All right.  Well, sure nice to meet you.	So nice
Larry?	Yeah?
Okay.  But we're still missing something key here.  What are we missing?	I know.
Looks good to me.	Aren't you supposed to keep them?
Thanks for everything.	You bet.
Yes?	Looks like today's your lucky day
So what brings you here?	I'm looking at new cars.
Well, I# I# that's very nice of you.	I've got an idea.
What's this?	My house.
Oh, is this#?  God. First one of these I haven't been in for a long time.	Would you sign it for me?
What a surprise.	Take as much room as you want
So# what do you have to tell me?	Well, this is hard for me, but I think it's important to be honest. Don't you?
Could you get this? I can't	Sure.
So what do you think?  Should we get a room?	Should we get a what?
Shall we give it a name?	Dave.
What do you want, Jim?	You're there.
Paul, I know you've been pretty down since your accident.	I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to#
You said I was a liar   You're the liar, you're the --	Larry, you just take it easy
What?	I told you # I can't. I just -- It doesn't feel right anymore, you know?
Where 're you going?	I'm not like you.
Are you crazy?	What?
She's doing this to get back at me	For what?
Who put you up to this?	What do you mean?
Yes, Paul?	Have a great summer.  And good luck at college.
How's the left these days?	What's it to you?
Somebody hit you?	It's not what you think.
I remember you from Christmas Eve.  You have a thing for helping women, don't you, Officer White?	Maybe I'm just fucking curious.
Will you work for me?	Of course# But how?
You know him?	Seen him around.  He used to be a cop.
Hey, partner.  Grab a cup.	I got to write my report first.
What's through here?	No!  Please leave!
One in six.  Where's the girl?	Officer White, put down that weapon and --
A naked guy with a gun?  You expect anyone to believe that?	Get the fuck away from me.
How's it going to look on your report?	It'll look like justice.  That's what that fat fuck got.  Justice.
You wanted to meet here?	Me?  You called it.  I got a message that#
She's fine.	I'm not asking you.
Thanks, but no thanks.	Against your code?
Anything?	Nothing.
I heard you like to shoot dogs.	Dogs got no reason to live.
You should stay away from a man when his blood is up.	His blood's always up.
You're the key witness?	That's right.
I need to speak to you.	Give me a minute, will ya?
What's that for?	Bud White.  He sees us and we're dead.
I'll tell you what I told Officer White when he asked me about Susan's death.	Bud White's been here?
I'm curious about you.	Why?
How was I?	Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
Have we met before?	Yeah.
Was it a party?	Something like that.
And you were the last one to talk to him.	Yes.
I just gave him my card.	He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
You've got it on tape?	Clear as day.
No one. But I'm a little nervous.	When can you get it here?
What kind of a question is that?	A direct one.
You knew the deal. No contact.	Who was that other guy?
What if I find out what they're after. You know these people, I don't.	And you won't. Now move--
Get dressed. We're leaving.	You could knock on the door, you know, and I'd open it.
Did you call anyone?	What do you mean?
What the fuck?!	They shouldn't have come without calling first.
Gimme that.	You sure?
Think we let out enough air?	Oh my God#
We lost 'em.	That wasn't so hard.
Drive.	We're not gonna hurt you.
He came in four minutes ago.	C'mon.
Is it okay?	You got any money?
Do you see anything you like?	I'm married.
I think she'll like this very much.	Listen, Daniel, hang on one second.
Did he give you anything?	No.
Bobby!	Not a very good one, but--
You're a lawyer. Don't you care what's going on around you?	Something bad happened tonight.
Bobby?	Yeah.
I don't understand why Jerry couldn't clear this up.	Well, you know--
Does that hurt?	Well#yeah.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.	That's okay.
Are you sure you're safe?	Yeah.
Is it over?	It's over.
I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand. You wanna fuckin' what?	I'd like to speak to someone about what's happening to me.
And then what?	I'll see if I can, you know, work things out.
"Soon". Or at least sooner than never.	It's how he works.
Good. You're just what I need right now.	You got a minute?
I can't.	You have to.
Fuck you. When you needed information, I got it. You didn't care how.	I did care how.
He didn't give me--	--otherwise we may have to--
Jesus! What?! You want money?!	Shut the fuck up.
Hey!	Forget me, forget what I did for you. Don't ever mention my name or try to contact me again. Get it?
He's kidding.	Where's mom?
Dad!	Do I know you?
It's okay to use the phone.	Alright!
Jerry--	Christ!
I'm sorry, man.	No. No, it's okay.
Bobby? Piece of advice?	Yeah?
What is it you want?	Someone's trying to destroy my life, and I'd like to find out who.
Well we'd sure like to help you.	You would?
What's your opinion?	It's hard to say for certain, these things are--
What happened?	He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.
We'd have to--	Get it.
What about--	We don't know.
Now is that clear?	Yes sir.
How much did you pay?	Hello!  Good morning.
Why did you follow me yesterday?	Excuse me?
What is he saying?  Come on, what did he say?	He said - be careful.
Actually, you sing.	Pardon?
What am I looking at?	See what's happening to them - the stars.
This is not very good, is it?	No.
Do they know them?	No, but I think I do.
Will you not come in?	No.
When were you most happy?	Now.
Say you're sick.	What?  No!
I can still taste you.	This is empty, just coming!
Why did he bring you?	A surprise, he said.
Why did you hate me?	What?
It's so cold.	I know.  I'm sorry.  I'll make a fire. I'll be back.
Shall we be all right?	Yes.  Absolutely.
A broken car?	Still a car.
Good morning!	Could I trouble you for some water?
How are you?	Okay.
Is this you?	I don't know.
Yes, I've been asking for weeks, a month, I don't know, also my leg was -	We don't have a doctor, but we do have a nurse.
There's a man downstairs.  He brought us eggs.  He might stay.	Why?  Can he lay eggs?
Excuse me -	Yes?
I'll probably marry him.	Really?  That's sudden.
I liked it better when there were just the two of us.	Why?  Is he staying?
I'm still here.	You'd better be.
Why don't you go?  You should sleep.	Would you like me to?
For my hair?	Yes, for your hair.
Why would anyone do this?	I've done this.  I've had to do this.
Will you come with me?	Of course.  When?
He's gone, hasn't he?	No.  He's - no.
You should sit down, darling.  She's quite all right.  Are you pregnant?	I don't think so.
This is wonderful!	What's he saying?
They've never caught him before, what makes you think they'll catch him now?	You got a better idea?
We've got to catch him in the act.	Why didn't I think of that?
You don't call, you don't write.	This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
I have a question#	Who am I?
Why are we speaking Chinese?	Uh. I'm showing off.
You have a car?	Uh, yes.
You're not taking me seriously.	Oh, I'm taking you#quite seriously.
I didn't expect you to be so#	So what?
Do you mind?	You#you can't.
I've got something for you.	Oh, that's quite all right. No charge.
And I thought we were getting on so well.	We were, we are, but this is perfect for you.
For God's sake.	I'm sorry. This just means so much to me.
We going somewhere?	Possibly.
Very nice.	Not a word.
It's a test.	That's my girl.
How much am I paying?	I'm paying#one point five million and change. I hate round numbers.
He says they turned the card down.	Damn, I knew I forgot something.
What the hell was that?	Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out.
It's one way.	We're only going one way.
We're going to die, aren't we#	I'm not the one to ask#
Those are my clothes.	Certainly not mine. Come on.
I don't believe this.	What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
Lose something?	I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.
You're late.	I'm dressed.
And good morning.	Good morning.
Nice try. Everyone thinks I did.	That's because I wanted them to!
I didn't mean to get personal.	Yes you did.
You bought this for me?	Don't get any ideas. Of course it comes out of your share.
Thank you.	Thank you.
We're working.	It's a party.
One, two, three#	You're not on the beat.
Ready?	Ready.
They moved it.	Behind you.
Careful#careful.	Shut up.
Now's when you tell me who you really are.	What?
STOP! You're making#mistake.	It's your mistake.
Your share.	Get the hell in.
We're living history here.	You don't know the half of it.
Do you know what you've done!? Do you know?	Would you quiet down! Just for a minute?
What about the rules?	My job, my rules.
So how long till we do this?	We're doing it tonight.
No way to take another day or two?	No. You'll see when we get inside.
But would you--would you--	Have really held you under?
So what are you going to do with your share?	Oh, I don't care about the money.
Jesus.	You can do it.
Come on.	No way.
Hang on.	Get out of here!
I cannot get rid of you.	No, you can't.
Put this on!	I'm not leaving without you.
Right.	Because I never assume anything.
Oh, it is.	It better be worth it for me.
You two make quite a couple.	We're supposed to.
This is just show and tell.	I'm waiting for the tell part.
Takes a lot out of you, one like this.	Yes it does.
See you.	Probably not.
Where've you been?	What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
What the hell is this doing here?	It's those files you asked for.
What's she doing here?	Who?
What?  Hey -- he hit me.	So you say.
It's a good day.  I feel good.	Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop.
The judge came up with a number.	A number for the whole group, or for us?
Oh, my God.	And he's making them give five million of it to you all.
I don't even know how much money that is.	It's enough -- for whatever you need, for whatever your girls need, for whatever your girls' girls need -- it'll be enough.
I can put them in a good school.	Any school you want.
You do know how to do that, don't you?	Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.
You're a girl.	Excuse me?
You wanna talk about --	No.
I like this case.	Really?  It makes me sick.
Hey.  I like working with you.	Well, good, Ed.  I like working with you too.
Someone's following me.	What?  Who?
What kind of truck?	I don't know.  Big.  Dark.
I want my fucking money --	I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here --  Do you mind?
Because that's how people treat each other!	Not in my world.
Look, this is serious now.  They're talking serious money --	And, what, I'm not serious?
How dare you take that away from me.	No one's taking anything --
I don't know what to say.	Say you were wrong.
But I know you're not gonna quit on me.	How do you know that?
What is that?	Take it.
And you were told to destroy those?	That's right.
Oh, hey -- lemme give you a hand there.	Thank you very much.  Aren't you a gentleman?  Mr. #
Look, I know you're mad.  But the way this job is, things come up at the last minute, real important things, and I gotta deal with them.  Now I don't like me missing dinner any more than you do, but we're all gonna have to get used to it, cause the fact is, it's gonna happen sometimes.	It happens all the time.
What are you doing?  Where's George?	I don't know.
Yeah.	Thank God we got you away from her, huh?
How come her own mom isn't helping her?	Cause her own mom's real sick, too.
Okay, look -- I think we got off on the wrong foot here --	That's all you got, lady.  Two wrong feet. In fucking ugly shoes.
You want my number?	I do.
No.	C'mon.  I bought 'em for you, to make up for that night.
I'm not gonna leave my kids with you.	Why not?
This isn't gonna get you laid, you know.	Yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we?
What're you doing?	Better safe than sorry.
You think it could make you sick, living in a place like this?	What do you mean?
Great.	I'm gonna clean it up.
You mind telling me what that's supposed to mean?	Nothing.
I'm just saying -- we have one night to ourselves, why do we have to spend it here?	Cause it's my office party.  If you had an office, I'd go to your party.
That's Ed.	Lock the door.
Fuck you.  Just cause I don't spend all day trying to prove what hot shit I am --	That is not what I'm --
What's going on?  What are you doing?	Thinking.
About this.	What's that?
They said that'd be tomorrow.  They just wanna keep an eye on me another night.	Fine.  I'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon.
Hello?	Hi.  It's me.  I got a favor to ask you.
How long's this whole thing gonna take?	I don't know.  Few days.  Thanks for helping me.  I appreciate it.
And I miss you.	Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find.
Think you could learn?	You know me.  I pick things up real fast.
You shouldn't be driving around, you know. You're sick.	Yeah, but I'm gonna get better.  A lot of these folks aren't.
What time is it?	Real early.  We're just gonna take your car to get some breakfast.
No, I need my car --	We'll just be a minute.  Get a little more sleep.
Promise you'll turn around if you get tired.	I will.  Bye.
There's something else, too.	What?
Oh.  Oh.	No one put me up to anything.  I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions.
My lord.	Come in, Admiral.
He'll learn.	He's too old.  Yes.  Too old to start the training.
I can't #	You must.  Luke, look at me!
You must survive, Luke.	I'm cold # so cold #
# Like we're being watched.	Away put your weapon.  I mean you no harm.
Give me that!	Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not.
Sir, I was wondering #	Sit down, and shut up!
It sounds like it's trying to get in.	I'm going to see what it is.
#. I'm afraid there's not much left.	What was it?
Well, you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong.	I take it back.
Why, Princess, this is so sudden.	Very funny.  You can let go now #. I'm getting angry.
Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited.	Well, I hope you don't expect more.
Sure.  I guess I make it difficult sometimes.	Yes, you do.
Stop that.	Why?
There's something out there!	Where?
I don't like this.	It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here.
I was worried about you.	I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him?	Don't ask me, but he's on his way.
Don't shoot!  I've done what I can for you.  I'm sorry it's not better, but I've got my own problems.  I've already stuck my neck out further than I should #	Yeah, you're a real hero.
What's going on?	I'm coming over to your side, that's what.  And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.
Look, I stand to lose everything by this.	We have no use for your kind.
What'd you say?	I didn't say anything?
I'm sure my men fixed it.  We've got nothing to worry about.	That sounds familiar.
Closer?!	Closer?!
What??	Oh my, no!
Where are you going?	I have this # feeling.  I'm not sure, really #
I can't. It's too big.	Size has no meaning.  It matters not.  Look at me.  Judge me by my size do you?
Four this time!  The Force you feel.	Yes # I also feel danger # death.  Something's not right.
Ben?  Ben?	Free your mind and return he will.
So am I.  And I mean you no harm.	We know that.
Nobody's going to believe it.	Believe what?
May I say something personal?	Please
I need a favor.	What's in it for me?
I'm already dead.	I see your point. What's the favor?
You're a star in your own right, you know that? Hey, I'm Map To The Stars Eddie. How you doin'?	Where'd they go?
Stop the damn car.	No way.
Where is it?	Right over there.
Me too?	We'll see.
I don't know about this thing.	Don't like it, don't come.
What're you doing in here?	Looking to get out.
Don't follow me.	You need help.
This is a dead end.  You took us into a dead end!	I just thought you wanted to get away. I didn't know you wanted to go someplace.
All of us?	Yeah.
When you threw it in, what did you see?	#I saw nothing.
How? Where?	In the great book.
A king must marry, after all.	#of course#
Who does it serve?	You, my lord.
There are things about love--	--Nothing!
Why didn't he kill us?	He has given up.
The King without his sword, the land without a king#	We are to blame.
No, no, of course not. You are young#	I'm not jealous!
They do.	Why?
Now you must pay me.	I?
What honey?	Fuck it.
Hello?	In here!
Hi	Hi, how'd your day go?
Here.	Oh great, anything else?
Where do you want this?	What is it?
I'm gonna miss you.	Me too.
Would you like some more coffee?	Please.
Oh, she'd love it.	What's her name?
Thank you.	You're a nice man.
There is nothing.	Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that.
Bastard! I will kill you.	Karl!!
Excuse me Miss?	What!
Excuse me Madame? Will there be anything else?	No thanks Karl.
Do you keep any drugs in your house?	No. Of course not, nothing like that.
Wanna drink.	Please.
No it's alright I'll take it straight.	Are you sure?
Yes. He's already here.	Father?
Is she gonna die?	No.
Well, not while we're in Washington.	Oh####
Oh look at that.	You like it?
Hey, where'd this come from?	I found it.
You've been playing with it?	Yeah.
Wait a minute you need two.	No you don't. I do it all the time.
What are we gonna do on your birthday, isn't that nice it's on a Sunday this year, what can we do?	I don't know
Yeah	Okay. And tomorrow night, I'll take you to a movie, okay?
People get tired.	Why does God let us get tired?
Oh my God!	Make it stop! What's wrong!! I'm scared!!!
I don't want it.	Honey it's to help you.
Mother please! Oh please mother make it stop! It's burning, it's burning please mother!	So something please Doctor, Help her!
Goodbye Father. I call you.	Okay.
Think you can sleep?	Are you gonna steal my shoes now?

Did you do that?	Uh Huh.
Do it again.	In time.
What's that?	Holy water.
I'm all right.	How's your leg?
Your Uncle John stopped by to visit me.	Oh really, when?
Is that too tight?	No.
What is it?	Her heart.
You're not my mother!!!	Don't listen.
Hey, Father? You like movies?	Very much.
Miss?	Yes?
No.	Why not?
Give me the keys.	You're not going to drive.
What's this?	Your pay.
Nothing's the matter. Is it, sweetheart?	I'll take her inside.  You too, little Frank.  Out of the pool.
They gotta go.	How many?
What do you say we go for a walk, pal.	Get your hand off me.

By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow.	No thanks.
So what'd we get her?	You'll see.
I made her nervous.	What do you mean?
What's with Charlie?	Nothing.  Everything's great. Terrific.
Yeah?	It's me.
So you'll come out, right?	Yeah, okay.
Nice, huh?	What?
Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?	I don't know what you mean.
Look, can we forget last night? We gotta talk.	Talk.
Jack.	Let's get it over with.
What are you, crazy?	I just thought we should talk about it.  Between ourselves.
What's the matter?	I didn't get her number.
Where the hell is she?	It's early.
You hit me.	I told you I was gonna hit you.
No.	Here, how's this?

We're not getting paid then.	No.
Jack, you're on television.	Shut up, Frank.
Jack!	Who's weak now, big brother?
I didn't hear you come in.	What're you doing?
Go ahead.	No.
Looks like these got a few years on them.	This'll kill 'em.
Charlie called.	Yeah?
You sure?	Just call me a cab.
You're an hour and a half late.	My watch is broken, too.
So?	Uh # we'll let you know.
When?	When we know.
What's the problem?	The problem is I can't hear myself sing with all this#  # music.  You know what I'm saying?
Come on.	Hey!
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.	Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?
Hey, pal.  I don't know about you, but where I come from there's a little girl's room and a little boy's room and the little boys don't go where the little girls go.	All right, but make it quick.  Shoes!  What size do you wear?
What do you think?	Uh# good.
Shoes?	Right.
Fucking.  She says fucking in front of an entire room of people.	I said I was sorry.
And how about this air? I'm telling you, a few days in this place'll put five years on your life.	Smells like fish.
Hey, will you look at that?	They must've bought the same map we did.
Oh yeah?	He's just afraid to show it. Aren't you, little brother?
What's with you two?	Jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle.
What's with you guys?	Someone needs to grow up.  I won't take it, Jack.
I can't sing it anymore.	What?
Terrific, boys.  Really.  Terrific.	Thanks, Lloyd.
Funny hours.	Funny job.
No, I, uh, left a dog here this morning. He needed some work on his mouth.	Regular hours are eight to five.
You want to know if he's okay. Right?	Yeah.
Well, now, where's everyone run off to? Frank?	Downstairs.
No.	I'm tired.  Really.  I should get home.
It went well tonight.	Frank works hard.
You miss him, don't you?	It's been a long time, Ma.
He do that every year?	Every year.
Oh, sorry.  With the light always on, it's hard to tell.	It's okay.  Last one.
If you want, I got a pack in the room.	No thanks.  I never touch French cigarettes.
It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.	Just dinner and dance, right?
I can keep the beat.	Better than that.
What's the matter?	Nothing.
History.	Huh?
The both of them?  In there?	He called her.
I don't know.  Maybe he thought some rich guy was gonna try and call her.	Wow.  But I still don't see how #
Oh. Hi.  Sorry.	Coffee?
You can always get another girl.	There's always another girl.
Saw the sign outside.  Got your own sign, huh?	Yeah.  Got my own sign.
What kind?	Huh?
Jack.	Hi.
Let me get the light.	No.

What did he do?	He hit a guard.
Where am I?	My place.
Perfect fit.	Should be.  It's yours.
Go on, Adam #  I'm not asking you for anything -- I was never even going to tell you. But hell, I never thought I'd see you again, either.	How old is he?
That's not the worst part.	What's worse than losing five million bucks?
Is someone there?	Eve, listen carefully.  The man you think is your husband -- isn't.
You'll what?	I'm going to have you fired.
You've got someone in your office.	Get rid of them.
Commander, what are you doing here?	Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?
What is with you tonight?	Don't I usually kiss my wife?
Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date?	They say love is blind. Do you think that's true?
I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.	Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
So -- how long will you be gone this time?	Gone?
Her assistant?	Yeah Jack, her assistant#
No#	No?!  You almost married this woman.  Aren't you even curious what she wants?
Hello?	Hey Santa, where are you? Everybody here.

You have kids, Jack?	Uh#actually, yes. Two# good ones.

Oh man, you're serious#  This man thinks I need to be saved!	Everyone needs something.
Yeah?  What do you need?	Me?
Look, I'm not saying you'd be able to do it without some hard work#	You still think this is about me, don't you?
Miss me, Jack?	That my car!  You stole my car!
Figure it out.  You got plenty of time.	How much time?!
What this, a signal? Will you come whenever I ring it?	Do I look like I live in a bottle?
Like the dress#?	It lovely#
Finger food#?	I don think so, thank you#
Are we#?	Are we what, Jack?

Thank you#	It good, right?
Say it, Jack#	What#?
Jack.	Wait a minute.  Youe my wife?
Maybe I should wait#	No, open it#
You really are incredible#	Enjoy it, sweetheart#
I need to tell you something.	Okay#
I used to be so sure about everything, you know?  I knew exactly who I was and what I wanted. Then one morning I woke up and suddenly it was all different#	Worse, you mean#
Imagine having a life where everything was easy#where you asked for things and people just brought them to you#	It wonderful#
Good things#	What are you sure about?
Youe so#beautiful#	I already told you you were gonna get lucky, Jack#
I could stay here forever#	I don think I fight you on that one#

You can go!	Jesus, Jack#
Damn#damn#damn#	Hey, are you okay?
Hey, my wife in the kitchen. You got a cigarette?	I sorry, no#
I want to see you again.	I'd like that, too.
Don't you have anywhere to go?	I've got plenty of places to go.
I don't think She's real big on hate.	You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
Such a sad face# You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.	Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
We're going to have to work on your touch.	I like the sound of that.
I can't take this.	Ben.  This is business.  Just work.
What about his first born?	Ben, the money's not important.  We could save lives.
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?	Five times.
How long was I out?	Three days.  I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
What the --!	Ben.  Are you okay?
We had a tough year.	Yeah, nine years straight.
What did you wish for, honey?	I already got it.  Everything I want.
What are you doing here?	I'm worried about you.
Ben, come in.	What is this?  Where's Reed?
He didn't.	Oh, he did.
Where is Reed?	Victor must've taken him.
This is wrong in so many ways.	You've been working out.
You're hot!	So are you!
You're on fire!	Not this again --
Stop it.	Okay, "mom."
What is that thing?	I think that thing is Ben.
I'm driving.	Dude.  That's my sister.
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?	Not at all.
Come on, Ben, come on#	Reed, we're running out of time.
Not until Ben is back inside!	It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
I, uh, think I remember the number.	It's been changed.
Feeling better?	Yes, thanks.
Uh, Sue#?  I can't.	What?  What do you mean you --
What?	We need to get past them.
Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.	What#?  Oh.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?	That's what we're here to find out.
I mean, you broke up with me, right?	Are you kidding?
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --	He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
Remember our first date here#?  God, I was so nervous.	You were?
When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door.  Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.	Why didn't you say something?
I can#make it work.	Reed, stop, you need to rest your --
What's going on?	Victor, are you feeling alright?
Victor, I'm sorry I --	Just find him.
Victor, wait, slow down a second.  I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --	Susan.  What are you doing?
Please don't make this personal --	Oh, I think you already have.
Where do we stand?	Medical's ready.
But we have no choice! We've got, to take them out!	No#
Doctor#without killing him -- how long could we stop his heart?	The less time, the better.
I told you to cut down on the sugar.	I can't help it. I'm just weak, I guess.
-- and why we need you.	?
Just one, General#	Yes?
Oh yes, great. The only problem is, he can't remember what he came to tell us.	Can't remember?# What do you mean?
But we just can't leave him in there! What'll happen to him?	We'll know -- in the next breath#
What is it?  Anything wrong?	I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.
That'll teach you where to keep your hand.	Now I know#
Then how come it worked loose?	I have no idea.
I'll try to hold it from the other side of the wall, while you push from out here. Maybe that'll do it.	You can't --it's too dangerous --
No need to get up --	I feel much better now#
Doctor, what's wrong?	I can't breathe!# I've got to get out!
What can we do?	Nothing -- against all that force.
Tell them to take us out.	If there's any chance --
Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.	I thought I was on my vacation# What's it all about?
May I?	Go ahead.
What'd you do that for?	I'm married.
#What do you mean, you decided not to park here?	Yeah, I just came in. I decided not to park here.
You, uh# I'm sorry, sir, but -	I decided not to - I'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.
This is a new car, then, sir?	It certainly is, officer. Still got that smell!
Or your fucking wife, you know.	Or your fucking wife, Jerry.
Clear him off the road.	Yeah.
#So I guess that's it, then.  Here's the keys -	No, that's not it, Jerry.
Well, it's all just part of this - they don't know I need it, see. Okay, so there's that. And even if they did, I wouldn't get it.  So there's that on top, then. See, these're personal matters.	Personal matters.
Both of these.	Oh, no, I can't let you do that.
#What's the big deal? It's an hour -	Hold on.
Okay, I'll do a damned lot count!	Sir? Right now?
#If it's so damned important to ya!	I'm sorry, sir, I -
How ya doin', Wade?	What's goin' on there?
#You can sleep, hon. It's early yet.	Gotta go?
I'll fix ya some eggs.	That's okay, hon. I gotta run.
#I'm sorry# I shouldn't a done this# I thought we'd have a really terrific time, and now I've#	It's okay#
Uh-huh.	We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
What# ?	The garden.  Take him there.  Move, people.  Let's do this!
Get your hands off him!  Get off#! What the hell do you think you're doing# ? Evidence?!  This is a man# !  You killed him!	He was killed in action.
No.  I found something new.	Really, what's that?
That's a fucking great, man!  Fucking great! Congratulations.	Yeah, both of us.
Is that your blood?	Some of it, yes.
I must've left the original in the copy machine.	"The second rule of fight club# Is this yours?
We need to talk.	Sure.
I# I don't know.  I guess# when people think you're dying, they really listen, instead#	-- Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.
Looks like this is goodbye.	Let's not make a big thing out of it.
What are you doing here?	What# ?
It's time for you to leave.	Don't worry, I'm leaving.
Where?  Here?	Here.
Make sure.	Okay.  Okay, I'm sure.
You# don't have to# leave.	Whatever.
I don't understand.  Why does a weak person have to go out and find a strong person# to hang onto?	What do you get out of it?
You hear that?	Hear what?
No.	That day you came over to my place to play doctor# what was going on there?
What is this?  Who did this?	# A person.
I'm trying to tell you -- and this is where you have to trust me -- but, I think your life might be in real danger.	What?
There's a part of you I really like, but I can't do this anymore.  I just can't.  This is killing me#	I'm sorry, but I#
Leave me alone!  I don't ever want to see you again!	Okay, if that's what it takes, you'll never have to see me again.  Here# here#
What happened# ?	Don't ask.
My God, you're shot#	Yes.
Who did this to you?	I did, I think.  But, I'm okay# I'm fine#
Hello?	Who's this?
How have you been?	# You know me?
It's getting exciting now.	That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love, well, it works both way.
I guess so.	And, now it's gone.
Insurance'll cover it.	Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
I don't know about this.	I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?
Why not you?  I'm letting you go first.  Do it.	This is crazy.
How do you feel?	Strange.
If you could fight anyone# one on one, whoever you wanted, who would you fight?	Anyone?
My boss, probably.  Who would you fight?	My dad.  No question.
Where's your car?	What car?
I mean, this girl# uh, you're not into her or anything# ?	No.  Not at all.
You're sure?	Yeah, I'm sure.
You're okay with this?	I'm fine.
What?	You've gotta understand something about me.  I have a little rule, okay?  Don't ever talk to her about me.  Ever.  I can't stand that kind of shit.
If you ever say anything about me or about what happens here in this house, to her or anyone -- I will find out.  And you'll never see me again.  Promise me.	Okay.
You want to finish her off?	Uh# nah#
You get rid of her.	Don't mention me.
This is the greatest moment of your life and you're off somewhere, missing it.	No, I'm not#
No thanks, I quit.	You quit?
What# ?	Nothing.  Do what you like.
I feel sick.	Imagine how he feels.
Hey.	Hey.
Something on your mind?	No.
I don't know!  Nothing!	If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
What are you talking about?	Nothing.
This conversation#	# is over.
You're too young.  Sorry.	Wait a minute#
People think that you're me, because you and I happen to share the same body.	What# ?
The first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club.	And, sometimes you control it#
Oh, yeah.  I didn't really know my Dad#	But, when you fall asleep, I do things without you#
There!  Happy?  I asked for one thing from you# one simple promise.  Now look what you've done!	This isn't possible#
No!  This isn't true.  We# we were around other people, together, both of us#	You never talked to me in front of anyone else.
I'm pulling the green wire.	Green?  Did you say green?
Yes#	Don't pull the green wire.  Pull anything but the green wire.
One minute.	I think this is about where we came in.
Can't you call it off# ?	It's out of our hands.  This is it.
Why# why# why# ?	Why what?
What are you doing?	What have you left for me?
Do something for me.	What?
He don't own this place, I do.  How much money's he getting for this?	There is no money.
Would you rather be dead?	No, please, no, God, no!
You have to tell us now.	I#I#
What about that?	How you doing in there, hero?
What do you want me to do?	Speed up.
Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.	Taken care of.
Please.  It's not going to wait.	I've got to stop and help those people.
We had a fight.  Some things got broken, the dog went crazy, she left me.  Wouldn't say where she was going.	What was the fight about?
Whoa, nine months?	Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Shouldn't we pull over?	No time.  Keep going.  I wouldn't know how to explain any of this anyway.
Welcome back.  We did it.  For real.	I know.  I can feel it too.
Want me to drive?	No, I'm good.
What is it?  What are you?	There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die.  All of us!  I saw it!
What is it?  What are you?	There's going to be a huge accident! Everyone's gonna die, all of us, I saw it!
Can I ask you a question?	Sure.
And you're gonna die after me, right?	I guess so.
I know this is the first time we've been apart since.  But everything's gonna be okay.	I know, honey.  I just --
I know it's crazy, but I'm really scared for the others.  I've got this terrible feeling.	What feeling?
I'm sorry.  I'm just so happy that you're safe.	I love you too, Dad.  Goodnight.
Mom?	Yeah?
How would I know? You think I'm some sort of#	He's not a witch.
Is that something you're "feeling?"	I don't know. I wish I could just see him# one more time, then, maybe#  I would know.
This place?!	Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.
Most kids do, I guess.	Most kids never have it happen.
Stop the car!	Let us out!
Can't you open the door?!	Easy, Billy, just open it.
Carter, get out!	Don't do it! Don't do it!
Get out! Get out of the car!  Get out of the fuckin' car!	Get out! Get out of the car!
You know what to do.	No! No! Don't!
We're losing our favorite teacher.	Look, there's something you should all know.
Alex# can you promise me that no one else will die?	No# I can't. As long as I'm in here, it's outta my control.
I'm# a friend of his. His best friend. See, his father#	I know who you are.
It broke!	No one's that strong.
So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now?	They're watching me, see if I go to Alex.
Knock it off!	May as well go out under my own free will, right?
Get control of yourself!	That's what I'm doin'!
SHUT UP, BILLY!	WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!
You guys are real# aren't you?	Huh?
I gotta tell you, it's just luck you guys came when you did.  They move us around a lot# We only been at that camp a week.  Got a smoke?	No.
Wow!	What just happened?
Gettin' old, huh?	Yeah.  Second set.  Let's go.
Yeah.  Why not?	You break your leg, I'll have to shoot you.
You okay?	Keep it down, man.  I got problems.
You fucking crazy?  I need it to burn these things off.	No cigarettes.
That guy's not going to make it.	Nothing we can do, man.
I'm getting him out.	What?  Are you crazy?  We're supposed to take pictures and split. You're gonna blow the whole program.
You better take off.	Ain't you coming with us, sweet thing?
Christ.  How'd you get here?	Took bus, most of way.  I knew you would come here.
Yes you can.	How?
John.  My name is John.	It doesn't hurt.  Why doesn't it hurt?
Stay on your heading, Captain.	Sorry, Sir.  Can't do it.
All this is for us?	That's right.
I know#	Have fun.
Who're you?	American.  Come to get you out.
Hello, John.	Colonel.
This your stuff?	That's it.  My life.
Listen up.  You two are married as of now.  Get used to it.	I say we tape him to a chair.
You know, I think I# ordered some just the other day.	Well did you or didn't you?
Will it hurt?	That all depends on you. #Sure you don't want a drink?
#SO#anybody special in your life?	Do I look like I have someone special?
Yep! Right on it!	Huh#the restaurant's just around the corner here#
I'm sorry.	I smell gas# Do you smell gas#
You were attacked.  My God.  Should I call a doctor!  Did you call the police#	No, I'm fine# really#
# So# where did you sleep last night?	I# I stayed at a friend's.  Listen, I --
I'm not seeing anyone else.  I really was attacked.	Okay.  # I love you#
Well talk back.  He won't bite you.	Thank you very much.
It's so great to see you like this, honey# I can't tell you.	Thanks.
What have you been doing here!  Huh! I wanna know!  What have you been doing here?!	Listen!  We both got something out of it, all right!
I wanna go#Just let me go#	Uh#Where#where do you want to go?
You shouldn't hang around this neighborhood.	I# I was just leaving.
Your name was picked.	Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or# or# a list?
Now what?	Uh# you# you can pick out up to ten movies#
Okay# twenty dollars# When can you#	Tonight!  How's tonight?
Could you help me-- what was the name of that girl who just came in#	What girl?  I didn't notice.
Do you know what the Little People just told me?	The Little People?
See, you don't know him# That's why you're the one# You can get it#	Listen, forget the shoes.  I'll just take a cab# Uh#
I'm not married.	Funny -- you look married.
Here#I just would like to help you. I thought#maybe#you could use some money.	Fifty dollars?
But I gave it to you!	Well what am I gonna do with it?
He knows who you are!  He's afraid!  I can tell!	You're totally gone, aren't you?
Listen, he just needs to sleep it off. Someone will take care of him.	Who?
Are there any questions?	What?
Come on! Go for it! What the hell are they gonna do? They can't do nothin!	Nothing! They can do nothing! Gentlemen!
Tell me more. I want to know everything.	There isn't any more to tell.
Excuse me#	Listen, I'm not feeling well.
You're not going to play it again.	Well, lemme play the other side then.
Now quit, Bobby. You said you're goin' a help me pick a song.	You said.
I'll go out with you, or I'll stay here, and do anything you'd like for me to do# if you'll just do one thing. If you'll tell me that you love me.	You can sing the song.
I'm tryin', baby, so don't start gettin' mad now.	No, I'm not mad at you, hand. It'll be all right. Just spot and follow through#
Is it my turn again?	Right. Now show me a little somethin' this time, okay? Give me some form#
You like it?	I love it.
Just one minute, you! Don't you ever talk to me like that!	Shut up! All of you!
Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason.	I have to see how things are first. My father's sick, you understand? They wouldn't be prepared for me bringing anyone.
It's all right. He don't mean anything by that.	I don't, huh?
Bobby#	I can't talk to you right now, leave me alone#
Sure you don't want anything?	Fill it up.
How far are you going to?	Washington.
You don't have to tell everybody about it. Pretty soon they'll all go there and it won't be so clean.	How do you know it's clean?
Can I get you anything else?	No. How much do I owe you?
Wasn't it, ladies?	Are you talking to us?
Tea.	Would you tell her Bobby's here?
I just can't look at you.	Don't, then.
Robert#	Very nice.
Yeah# I guess so#	I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
Well#  I better let you#	Wait#
Maybe you better stay, then.	No, I need to talk to you, about so many things#
Oh God, I'm so glad, Robert, that you're coming#	Yeah, me, too#
How long have you been staying here?	A couple of months.
I mean, you think I'm that happy?	No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.
Well, you're not going to run out on me right away, are you?	I don't know.
Look at that.	Why are you being so mean?
I don't think I'd notice. I'm so used to Carl.	Yeah, well, he's#
Where is she, anyway?	My turn.
Bye, now.	Bye, Robert.
Hello#	I guess you fell in the water.
After that, I plan to read some music and rest for awhile.	Tomorrow, then.
That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised#	Thank you.
I don't find your language that charming.	It's direct, anyway, which seems to be difficult for you.
Serious, that's what's important to you?	Yes, that's what's important to me#
No, don't do that#	Shut up#
Robert?	What?
Where are you going?	I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?
No, I want to talk to you now. I have to explain something about#	No, you don't have to, it isn't necessary#
No, I can't#	Will you let me talk to you, please?
Four or five years.	No, the last time was three years ago.
I hope you feel at home, Robert.  I'm really glad you're here.	Thanks, Carl#
Robert, do you mind?	What?
See? There's nothing wrong with the way I walk. Now where are we?	At game, Carl.
Robert, I think you better just#	You're all full of shit!
Haven't you got a jacket or anything with you?	No, I don't, I uh# it got burned up. Everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. All I got left is what I have on#
Do you have a name?	Victor.
Yo.	Hi.
So you got a girl?	Of course.
So what you think of me?	You look good.
Come down!	I can't!
They are?	Yeah! Tell me which one you would like. To be doin' nothin on a fire escape or beat the pool with a bunch of girls? Be straight up!
Yo, remember from the pool, that girl?	Which one?
Like this?	Yeah, that's right, you got it girl.
You sure? She's got kind of like brown hair.	Positive.
You wanna do somethin' with me?	Not really.
I know how ta get him back if you want.	Nah.
Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.	You mean her.
Hey you're really nuts.	They didn't do anything.
You can't keep me here.	Maybe I'm not going to keep you here.  Maybe I'm gonna blow your brains out.
This one's going to be even more fun.	Go ahead. Make my evening.
What the hell are you doing here?	Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.
I've got it all under control, Jerry. You can go now.	Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?
So what do you figure?	No idea.
Jesus.	You don't know me.
Are you all right, Doctor?	Where am I?
Here you are, Doctor.	Thank you.
Read this, please.	Wait a second --
Ten days ago?	That's right. Alan comes by every three weeks or so.
Has he?	Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?
I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them.	Where are you going?
Fat Sam is turning state's evidence.	What's that?
Where does the Chief get the drugs?	I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
We can't talk about it here.	Why not?
Will you kill me?	Sure.
Yo!	Can I steal you for a minute?
Did you hear something?	Not me.
Thanks.	You doing a story on this guy?
Did you say cops?	Yeah.
My hero.	Nothing to it.
Cute young thing, too.	I'm sorry?
Hi.	Hi.
I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think# What do you want?	I ordered lunch.
I really should change.	No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.
Lunch#	God#
Thanks for the great time.	What is this?
So?	So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth.
What is this#.	I checked. There was no divorce.
And they're leaving the country tomorrow night.	Bastard.
Don't worry, I can take it.	You shouldn't be here.
Excuse me. I have something I'd like to discuss with you.	What?
Where is she?	Moved out.
I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.	She moved out.
Just kidding, Frank. You'll have the story and you'll be damn proud of it.	You broke it? You know the source?
But I ain't got you#	But I ain't got you#
No thanks.  I carry my own.	Excuse me?
Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?	Right away!
Let's get serious#	Why are all these people after me?
Yeah, it's weird.  Bobby and Johnny were such good friends#	Friends?  You didn't tell me that.
I'm afraid so, you want her?	But you know, that was just a dream.  Doesn't really count.
Nice left you got there, jerk.	Sorry, it was dark, now come on.
This way#	No, wait#
Are you okay?	There's that question#
This ain't no social call.  One hundred bucks.  To find my father.	Did he just say what I think he said?
I tried to help you#!	And hey, I appreciate it#
So, did you find my dad?	Well, I got some good news and some bad news.
It doesn't have to be like this?	Oh God, please, don't!
Kill them.  Not quickly.	Are you okay?
Did I say you could move that hand -- I'm not gonna get stuck am I?	No - no.
How's everything?	Everything is everything.
Who knows?	Where do you want it?
Did you pick up the car?	It is waiting for you in the garage.
Twelve o'clock# yes#	Yes --
Are you sure it is dead?	I'm going to put them on the cat.
There'll be someone else.	What difference does it make? We'll be out of the country Friday.
All right, get up on that bar and dance.	What?
I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.	He got off on six.
There may be two# no, three who could fit it.	Names.
That's in France.	Yeah, I know.
Never trust anybody.  You goin' sick?	Not a chance.
Why not?	Let yourself in.
What about Sal?	We put him to bed for the night.
Same car.	Third time around.
It looks open on the other side.	Don't know what's behind it.
Gotta be another way up, Frank.	Then fuckin' find it.  I'm going for the girl.
Hey, bud.	Hey, bud.
How about a little of the King?	Well, why not a little of the King?
Damn.	You alright?
Frank#what's wrong?	Nothing.  I just wanted to see you.
I love you, Bud.	I love you more.
Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow.	He ain't the only one.
I'm off.	Wish you weren't.
There's something I gotta take care of. Something I need to tell you about.	Okay#
I'll be upstairs#if you want to play.	I'm serious.
Hey, bud.	Frank#
Lucky throw, fire boy.	Luck, my ass.
Okay, I'm on it.  Hey.	Hello, Frank.
Frank, we need to talk#	John, hold on a second.  I'm in the middle of something important here.  You mind if#
What do you mean?	Do you know where I found this?
I'm scared.	Don't be scared.  This time I'm right behind you if you fall.
You ready?	Wait#
Yes!  That's it!  You got it, you got it! Way to go, Chief!	I'm doing it!  I'm doing it!
Sorry 'bout that.	What'd you just say?
You call your son Little Chief?	Uh huh#
Oh my god.	What?
That's impossible.	What if it's not#
Dad#?	Johnny#?
How could this be happening?	I don't know.
It's really you, isn't it?	Yeah#I think so.
What's that?	I think I'm losing you.
What are you talking about?	I lost you.
But that's tomorrow.	Tomorrow.  Jesus#it hasn't happened. It doesn't have to happen.
Dad#?	Chief?!  Is that you?
Dad, you there?  You okay?	Yeah.  I'm okay.  What about you?  I want to know.  About you.  And your mom.
We're doing all right, Dad.  We're doing good.	Tell me.
Dad, I gotta tell you this#cause you should know.  Cause I still remember.	What, Johnny?  What is it?
I'll be damned.	Did you see him?  Do you know who he is?
What else, John.  It must be different, huh?  Are people living on the moon?	Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here.
John, you still there?	I'm right here, Dad.
He killed her John.  He killed her and I didn't do a thing to stop it.	It's not your fault, Dad.
I need you to believe in me.  To believe that we can do this.	John, he's got my driver's license.
It's gonna work, Dad.  We're gonna stop him.	Hang on.
Dad, what the hell is going on?	Just a minute, John#okay?  Don't go away.
John, you there?	Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
I'm here, Dad.  I'm here.	We did it, John.  We stopped him.
Wait.  Something's wrong.  I don't#	What's wrong?
How you feeling?	Better.
My father didn't die in a fire?	Huh?
You're not looking too good.	Whoa, I just#I just#
Another rough night, huh?  That it?	Yeah.  That's it.
This is getting real old, John.  And I'm tired up to here with it#	I'm sorry.  I just#you know#I#
She makes ten.	Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.
Got a minute?	Yeah.  Sure.
I'm sure everything'll work out.  She really loves you#	So how are things at the hospital?
Hey, future boy.  Frank tells me you're a cop?	Yeah, that's right.
You used to be on the job?	Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?
Who the fuck is this?	Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
What is that?	I found this today.  There were other pieces of the body lying there, but I believe "he" wanted me to have this#
You're all just jealous.	Actually, I have no idea what the World's Record is.  I was just kidding.
What're you gonna do?	Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
So what would a weekend in the country be without sex?	Cool it, Andy.
Breakfast?	No way.  We're pregnant.  Remember?
Why don't we go take a swim?	I don't know#
How do we do it?	First we take off our clothes, then you get on top of me or I get on top of you#
Think you can figure it out?	I'll think of something.
What're you doin'?	I think it's called "a shower". You might try it sometime.
Do you want a beer or not?	Sure.
Destroy the evidence?  No, man!	Yes, man!
Which one is it?	It's the last house on the left. She lives downstairs.
I appreciate the fact that you worry about me, but don't.	Okay, we won't.  We'll just have fun, all agreed?
Come on down!	You go ahead#
What's this?	Your bed.
You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.	I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
You haven't changed a bit.  Always so sure of yourself.  Even when we were kids, when you wanted something, nothing could stop you.	Is that so bad?
This door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it?	What?
Look what I found.  Remember these?	Did you stay here last night?
What happened that night?	You promised you'd never ask me.
Could we move a little faster?	Sure, just watch where you're going.
You know him?	Sort of.
Faster!  Eat faster!	Why don't you help us?
Is# is everything all right?	Everything's gonna be fine.
Are they following us?	Yes.
See anything?	Just a dirty window.  Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that.  Let's just hope that "next time" isn't too soon.
I don't see anything.	Keep looking.
Got any good ideas?	Maybe.
Why do you do these stupid things?!	I have to.
I thought that was the end of the song.	Great.  Just great.
Yeah# We're gonna scare him.	We're gonna scare him?!
Don't worry about it.  Just stay cool.	Stay cool?  You ain't Dirty Harry. Now stop it.
Is that all you found?	I wish it was.
#And I said, shut up!	All he's asking is for you to check it out.
What?	Hide it behind the gas station. Then we can get the hell out of here.
It's all over.	It's just beginning.
There#Ya happy?	No.
Okay, give it back.	Come and get it.
They did show up.  Isn't that great?	I hope so.
So what happened?	There was this monster.  He was after me.  He wanted to kill me.
You mean you had a bad dream.	No, he was real.  Like on TV.
#Good.  So no more bad dreams can come around here, huh?	No more.
Where'd you get this?	I found it outside.
I can't believe no one called back.  I better#	Who ya calling?
But what if they try and scare us?	We'll scare 'em right back.
Hi.  Everything's all right now. We're here.	Yeah, we're here.
Aren't you the kid whose mother and friends were#.	Yeah.  Jason murdered them and#
Yes!	No!#  # You kids better leave.  This boy here is not well and I need to talk to him in private.
Doesn't that tell you something?!	Yeah#They should've paid their bill.
Well, let's hope not!	Yeah, that'd be a big shame#
#but there just may not be enough time.  If you still care about her, if you still want to try to make things better between you two#we should talk.	So let's talk.
Anything else?	Yes.
I know who you are.	I need to talk to you.
No, I --	Twenty.
What do you want?	You know what I want.  You know why I need you.
Everything going okay?	It's going.
I gotta get back to work.	Okay, I'll call you later.
Everything'll work out.  Trust me on that.	Okay.
Maybe you should be moving on.	Maybe you should mind your own business.
Why did you want her body?	For a good reason.
Wanna know how I did that?	Yeah#
Well?	I'm sorry.  I have to bring you to a cell.
I'll be back later.  You just be cool, okay.	Okay.
Oh, my dear God#	He was dead.  He had to be dead#
How many times do you want to hear this?	Until I hear the truth.
That was truly excellent.	Yeah.
Well#how do you feel?	Ask me in about five minutes.
What's wrong?	Nothing.
Did you hear that?	Hear what?
All right, all right -- I'm a major ass.	And you'll never do it again.
Where's the radio?	It's#dead.
She never should've set foot on this ship. This is your fault!	This is Jason's fault!
Dear Christ#	We have to get off this ship!!
Jason's here in New York.	Don't be ridiculous!
What are you doing in here?	Nothing.
Let's go -- we're running two minutes late.	Charles, there's someone else coming along too.
I thought I told you to stay away from her.	Where is she?
Everyone split up -- we'll cover more ground that way.	I don't think that's such a safe idea
What a beautiful day.	Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
He never learned how either and he's still at the bottom of this lake.	He is not.
I'm glad you decided to come after all.	Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.
So, are you having fun yet?	Yeah#a lot.
Did you have an accident in the lake?	No. It was just a normal summer. I've never been able to figure it out.
I got you a present.	But I didn't get you one#
It's okay#you're going to be okay.	I want to go home. I want off this ship.
I don't know#we've gone off course or something#	What do you mean???
I didn't mean for you to go!	Just radio for help, okay???
You have to call the police#	Please, hurry#
I'm trying to think. When did you start looking so terrible? You look awful.	I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
Is it safe?	Do we care?
I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab.	Where is it?
We're making too much of this.	No, we're not.
This could be it.	This could be it.
This could be it.	This could be it.
I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?	I go to college. I thought you knew.
I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?	Why do you need a radio?
And you blame me. It's because we never talk. Let's talk.	I have a class. I'm late.
What will we talk about?	Everything.
Will I believe you when you tell me something?	There's nothing left for me to lie about.
Why won't you tell me your name?	It's only our first date.
You have to tell me what you thought of the play.	First you tell me.
Life is good.	Life is good.
This could be it!	This could be it!
Life is true.	Life is real.
Who is it?	I'm at the door.
You see what you're doing, don't you?	What am I doing?
This could be it!	This could be it!
Then they lost?	Why does it matter?
Have to hurry back.	Hurry back. Hurry back to what?
Game six is history,pal.	You're not making sense.
Do you think he can do it?	I don't know.
You've come to me. I wanted to believe you would one day.	I haven't come to you.
Enough.	One more.
That was lucky.	I thought you were a man of God.
If I want to be one with them, I have to live like them.	I think you do.  But I thank God we all don't.
What'd he say?	He said he's in charge#
Tell me -- do you think about hell?	"Hell!"
What do you want?	That the fighting will stop -- that you make me believe it will never start again.
It's beautiful.	Even as a boy I thought so.
We need your help!	There is nothing I can give.
He was right. It's insane -- anything would have been better.	Have you found him?
Well?  You have all the answers.  How is that possible?	You didn't beat me that day.  I beat myself.
How much extra?	It would be five thousand more.
That's the last.	Something's not right.
What are you waiting for?	Where do we start?
It's not exactly him.	Where did you get this?
How often do you test, Director?	Often.
Good to see you're feeling better.	Now you're here.  Who are your "friends"?
You really need that much?	More than that.  You'll get used to it.
Who died?	The Mission Director.
I gotta stop!!  I gotta stop!!	Keep going!!  Keep going!!
Come on--we're taking off.	I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
Where are we going?	I'm sorry.  I've got plans.
Where are you taking her?	Michael's.
Hello?	How would you like to be yourself for the day?
Why have you done this?	In case you get back before I do.
My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.	Why not?
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean anything.	We were just looking.
Have they found our friend?	Friend?
You didn't know?	Yes#yes#
Of course I think about it every day.	Of course.
So you didn't do it after all.	I guess somebody beat me to it.
What is this place?	You've never been here?  Let me order for you.
What about the car?	Let's walk.
I can't.	Come on.
What is it?	I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later.
--when you go away.	We could go together one day.
A year is a long time.	Not so long--just once around the sun.
If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while.  One week to go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited.	I'll tell you at the end of the week.
I've got enough here.	Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes.
What are you doing?	I can't do this.
The doctor will give you something.	I'm not doing it.
We'll try again.	No way. I've got to get out now.
Hello, Doc.	Hi.
I'm sorry I was late# I got my hair done# the girl was slow.	It looks fine.
Feel good?	Yeah.
It doesn't look like that.	What do you mean? You've never been there.
You go out much?	After four years and now the question comes up.
I guess I'm kind of#	It's all right.
Wait# give me a minute.	Sure.
I'll be okay.	Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.
I was going to fix you breakfast.	You were asleep.
Yeah, well, I think I'll stick with what I've got.	Suit yourself.
Thanks again.  I 'm glad you waited.	I couldn't have# much longer.
Promise you won't laugh.	If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
Doc#	I see it#
Why didn't you tell me?	There wasn't any way to explain it.
How long ago.	Fifteen minutes.
There better be a guy with the	You bastard#
When we had trouble before it was different.	You don't like the way things are, I don't like the way things
We'll grab a room for tonight then you go out tomorrow and buy yourself some new clothes, pick some up for me# Grab some food now, paper bag it, we eat in the room.	You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train?
You've got it all figured.	No# there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
That would be the first time.	When are you going to learn?
You can't trust anything these days.	I'll tell you something, Doc. One day you're going to have to trust somebody#
I trust#  Want to see what I trust# In God we trust#  The word's on every bill!!!	You keep it up and it won't matter how far we get away, because it's going to be all over between you and me. Do you understand that? There won't be anything left.
Only one car.	Let's do it.
How much?	Twenty eight hundred.
Are you hungry?	Not now.
Okay?	I think so# I don't know.
Do what I tell you, it's not a game.	It's all a game, don't bother me.
We better stick here till tonight.	Yeah.
We're going to make it.	Sure#
I want to say something.	I don't want to hear it.
Look, what you said yesterday# I guess that was right. It isn't worth anything if we don't make it together.	I don't think we can any more# If we ever get out of here, maybe I should take off#
Sounds good.	You want to try with me?
Okay.	You and me.
We've got some food coming, should be here any minute.	Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
Come on, come on.	Who was it?
You okay?	Where do we go from here?
How long before this car's hot?	Pull over.
Are we going to make it?	Hell, I don't know# but we sure gave it a run.
What now?	We walk.
Hope you get to where you're going.	Thanks. Hope you do too.
You're out of touch. Cops blew him up.	Where?
Just in case someone gets a shot off.	I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.
Drive.	Suit yourself.
How was that?	Just fine.
I guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you?	I kinda doubt it.
Listen# how much money did you make this year?	What's it to you?
I don't think you have to worry much about Harold. He won't do anything.	That right?
I've got to stop.	I'll tell you when.
You knew what I'd do.	Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him.
What do you want?	What happened to this car?
You know what the bloody time is!  It's two o'clock in the bloody morning!	I know.
I made a mistake.	What?
That's not good enough.	Christ, what#
Jack?	Good evening.
Train goes at four minutes past twelve. You've just got time.	That's very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank?  What happens if I miss the train?
Who paid you to see me off?	I can't Jack. How can I?
Really.	I must go. I'm in a hurry.
How were things between you and Frank?	He was all right to me.
I know him too.	Who?
Yes. I met him last year.	Go on.
We went about together.	Really?
We weren't sure where it was taking place, like.	Nice of you to come.
Sorry about your father.	Yeah.
How's school?	I left last year.
You all right now?	Yeah.
Where you going to live, then?	At me friend's house.
Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't suppose I'll see you again.  There. Go and get your hair done.	Thanks.
I mean, what for?	That's what I was wondering.
See you later.	Where you off to?
What happened to you, then?	How'd you find me?
Did they give you a rough time?	No.  You bastard. You knew they'd come back.
I won't be using the room tonight.	I see.
Ta.	I'll bet this one's seen some action.
What is it?	My brother, Frank.
What the bloody hell do you think you're at?	I'm sorry.
And what you going to do?	Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch.
What'll they do to him?	Don't ask me.
They bloody hurt me.	You're lucky. They kill as well.
Are you awake?	No.
Did you sleep well?	Yes, thank you.
Are you tired?	No. Are you tired?
You coming back?	How could I stay away?
Is he?	Jack Carter.
Jack! I didn't like that.	You should have told me who you were working for.
Not going, Jack?	I have to. Things to see to.
Put it away, Jack. You know you won't use it.	The gun he means.
What's that? A hundred?	That's right, Harry.
All right. Two hundred.	Ha.
Four hundred?	That's right.
How about that, Jack?  Old Harry thought I was having him on.	Shut up.

Rick#?	I'm sorry, Jim.  I can't talk now. I'll call you tonight#I'm sorry. I'm coming, Ray. 
Rick#	One moment, I'll be right with you.  In fact, a#one point, which I spoke to you of which  I can't talk to you about here.
I don't know.  They said we have three days.  They said we have three days.	Three days.
You don't count Saturday.	I'm not.
I'm very sorry, Jimmy.  I apologize to you.	It's not me, it's my wife.
What's going on here?	Tell me again.  Your wife.
No, no.  That's just something she "said." We don't have to do that.	She told me I have to.
#what, what, say it.  Say it to me#	I#
The deal.	The "deal," forget the deal. Forget the deal, you've got something on your mind, Jim, what is it?
What?  What?  What, Jim: I tell you what, let's get out of here#let's go get a drink.	She told me not to talk to you.
What?	And the check is#
What are the police doing?	It's nothing.
Guess what the Machine did?	Fuck the Machine.
Fuck you.	Guess who?
We haven't got a lead#	Why not?
Listen to me: They got some of them.	Some of them#
Three?  I count two.	Three.
#I wouldn't worry about it.	Well I'm going to worry about it, and so are you, so shut up and listen.  I GET HIS ACTION.  My stuff is mine, whatever he gets for himself, I'm talking half.  You put me in with him.
Are you alright?	Yes.
Did you see my present for you?	No, where is it?
Your friend lives in a fine building.	Oh yes, the very best.
What took so long?	She couldn't decide.
I want to talk to you, Michael.	The children can stay.
Would you like some?	No, Dad.
I think there's only two hundred dollars under my hat.  I'm right.  Only two hundred dollars.	I'm a little short.  I've been out of work.  Let me owe you the money for a few weeks.
Hey Mike, what can I say?	Forget it, just go take care of her.
I don't have a lot to say, Michael.	We have time.
I bet you can't guess what happened?	What?
If you told Michael what I've told you today, I'm a dead man.	When is it finally over?  I want it to be over before my baby is born.
He doesn't want my help any more. He doesn't need it.	We don't know that's true, he never said that.
Hello?	She's gone, Tom.
You're going to talk to him now.	Yes.
Me too, Tom?	Yeah, give me a minute.
Did the boy get something from me for Christmas?	I took care of it.
Was it a boy or a girl?	Mike, at three and a half#
It might show.	Mike wants it.
What's up?	No questions.
How's the baby?	Sleeping inside me.
It's Michael.  How are you, Mom?	I'm alright.  Will you stay home for awhile?
I know.	When do we talk?
They're still on the property. Maybe you better stay inside.	Keep them alive.
We'll try.	It's important.
On the phone?	No, she's here.
What makes you say that?	Just thinking out loud.
So what did you think?	Weird.
You know what?  I think you guys are all jealous.	What's to be jealous of?
So you don't want to fuck.  That's what you're telling me?	Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
Don't worry, you already paid me. I'm here because --	The Master is waiting for you.
It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture.	I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
It's not what you think.	I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go.  We are having a guest for breakfast.
Thanks.  Why do you do it?	What do I do?
What have you done with him?	I put him to bed.  He's not there?
I didn't do it.  This wasn't me.	Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
You must leave.  You were not here this morning.	But I didn't do this!
Did you see this?  They're showing one of your movies tomorrow night.	You don't say?  Which picture?
Do you mind?	Go ahead.
Is this David's doing?	This David's a friend?
Saw your movie the other night. Watched it with some friends.	Did you now?
Did you kill anyone?	I don't like to talk about that.
So we understand each other?	What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.
Oh dear.  I have made you nervous.	I'm fine.  I'd just rather keep it on.
Is that why you and your friend split up?  Because you wanted to be free?	In a way, yes.  I suppose so.  I know it's why I stopped making pictures.
I suppose you'd like the top down.	If that's okay?
What did I tell you?  Listen.	I don't hear anything.
Who's that?	David.  The friend I thought was in New York.
Oh fuck.  And we left the top down. You want to run for it?	Run for what?
It's not like her.	Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
Do you mind?	Not at all.
So it is going to happen after all.	What'd you say?
No.  It won't do.	What won't do?
All right.  Let's take it off now.	What was that?
Wait until I tell my friends I had you naked in my arms.  Won't they be surprised?	I haven't done a damn thing with you!
Can't say that I have.  Can't say I've heard of a lot of people though.	If you don't believe me, let's watch this movie.  See if his name's on it.  How about it, Harry? Can I watch my damn movie?
Where's Betty?	She took the night off.  Heavy date.  Some guy she's had her eye on for a while.
I'm sorry, Jimmy.  But with this movie and two difficult stars --	"The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
What are you doing here?	Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
Please.  You shouldn't stand on my account.	Perfectly all right.  But if you'd like to sit --
How are you feeling, Mr. Jimmy? How is your mind today?	My mind's lovely.  And yours?
She is horrible.	She is beautiful.
That is my daughter.  She say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon.  I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy.  I will make it short.	I'll be out this afternoon, remember?  Your family can visit as long as they like.
Can that count as one question?	Of course.
What are you doing here?	Is there someplace we can talk?
Who was the job for?	Who do you think?
I think about that night a lot#	Me, too. Every time I walk#
I'm not interested --	I knew you'd say that.
Get out of here, Ray --	One more night --
You should never have gotten my brother and his friends involved #	But I had to. It was the only way to get to you --
Well, that certainly won't do.	What do you mean -- ?
I know you --	You know my back -
You have my word#	Get out of here, then. Now.
I know you.	You know my back.

How you know that?	Remember who my brother is?
You look good#	You, too, Ma#
Have you seen him?	No.
Why didn't you tell me?	I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?
You ever wonder what things'd be like if he hadn't died?	Every day. I wonder about that every day#
I know#	We do it. He'll get clear Once and for all

You mentioned that in your letters	I always thought you'd follow me up.
Ready -- ?	Oh, yeah.

You need him#	No we don't -

Give'm a drink.	I gotta talk to you.
Watch this.	Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
What fucking good are these things? They don't fit. What do I need this for? I'm not paying for this shit.	Right away I knew he didn't want them. I knew I was going to get stuck for the money. I only bought the damn guns because he wanted them. And now, he didn't want them. I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was so pissed he didn't even say goodbye.
I want to talk to Jimmy.	He heard.
It was the first time I had ever seen anyone shot.	You're some fucking jerk.
You ready?	Yeah.
You know what to do?	Yeah, yeah.
Do you realize what we're involved in here now?	I don't care. I need my hat.  I won't go without it.

Where have you been?	I'm sorry, I been real busy.
I couldn't wait till tomorrow.	How the hell did you do that?
I thought you said you'd show me your place.	Not tonight.
How's it goin'?	Fine.
Will? Are you awake?	No.
Yes I do. Did you ever think that maybe I could help you? That maybe that's the point, that we're a team?	What, you want to come in here and save me? Is that what you want to do? Do I have a sign that says "save me" on my back?
Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' bullshit me!	You know what I want to hear? I want to hear that you don't love me. If you tell me that, then I'll leave you alone. I won't ask any questions and I won't be in your life.
Take care.	Goodbye.
Maybe the road's out.	I don't know what these cops got to do with it but I don't like it.  An' these here are our own people, all of 'em. I don't like this.
So long.	Hey, wait a minute. You got change comin'.
Want to work?	Sure, but what is this?
They're all gone--or dead.	They never wrote you nothing?
How about us? Is that the truth for us?	I don't know.
Been doin' a job?	Yeah.
Where you going?	California.
Where you think you're going?	Thought I'd take a walk. Any law against it?
Anybody ask anything?	No'm.
I was so scared we was goin' away without you--and we'd never see each other again.	I'd a found you, Ma.
How about it, Ma?	I'm ready.
Got any more, Ma?	No. That's all. You made a dollar, an' that's a dollar's worth.
Listen!  That's them! Them lights! Come on, we got to hide out!	Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
All you got to do is lay down an' watch.	Won't they come out here?
Here we go!	California, here we come!

How do you know?	I just know.
You look like you're far away. Far away and thinking about other things. I'm right about that, aren't I?	No.
I been looking at you, and I've decided that I want to share something with you.	Okay.
I told them to kill you and they didn't.	Hard to get good help these days.
No deal.	Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job#
Hello, Bob.	Hey, Bob.
Well?	I don't think so.
I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.	We can't do our job unless he does his job.
He's falling for her. Look at him.	He using her.
Looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us.	If he does our job, he's our job.
Throw that away.	This?
They're not happy, sir.	I'm not happy.
Enough?	Never enough.
This is not good.	I'll do it tomorrow.
What's it look like?	It's fine.
It's good to see you. I'm sure you're curious about what I've been doing.	I spoke to your father the other day.
We had a good laugh, didn't we?	Yeah. I guess we did.
Marty! It's me. Paul.	Paul?
God it's great to see you.	You too.
It didn't work out.	That's too bad.
Why not?	So what are you doing with your life now, son?
Look, I'll talk to Grace and call you later--	Excuse me, with all due respect, but this is her decision, not yours. And I don't want to waste anybody's time -- mostly mine.
What?	You ever just stand still for a minute?
Enjoy the day.	You too.
Shit.	Need a lift?
How long did you live here with your wife?	Five years. My son was born here.
Why didn't it work out?	She was never really happy here. She did the best she could.
Now, listen. I want you to stand on him.	What?!
I won't apologize for this. And I won't hide it. Not for anybody.	I won't ask you to.
Show me again.	Annie!
I don't know any other way, Annie.	Why?
Then what have we been doing? I mean what was the point?	The point was to love each other.
Why don't you go lie down?	I don't want to lie down. I've been lying down enough.
Dad'll pick you up today, all right?	Okay.
Oh, honey# What happened?	Doesn't matter. I# I don't want to come back, that's all.
No, I don't mean you have to. It's just that we may not have enough --	-- enough time tomorrow. I know.
You should call your dad before it gets too late.	I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
Would you like to see that?	I don't care.
How long is this going to go on?	What?
Do you want us to turn around and go back home? Do you?	What are you asking me for? You didn't ask me if I wanted to come in the first place -- now I get to decide? Forget it!
Did you ask him to come visit?	You already did.
Honey, come on. Would you like to stay in town for dinner? Maybe see what movie's playing tonight?	Why? There's no food in the house?
Does anybody out there want something to drink?	I'll take care of it.
Nothing.	Did you go riding?
Grace? Is everything all right?  Can we talk?	About what?
Look, I just wanted to say, I think it's great you're riding again. And# and I think I know why you, you needed to do it alone# without anyone knowing#	Yeah, you know everything!!
What did you say?	I said# I started.
Who's going to want me now?	What?# Oh baby#
Who is it?	Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?
Oh, I miss you. You look beautiful.	So do you.
Great!	Go ahead#
David?	Who's there?
Uh, yes# Sure, David.	All right. Speak to you then.
It's me.	Hi.
So, what, uh, what train are you taking?	I should be in by two.
I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't have brought it up over the phone.	That's okay. We have to talk about it and we're not always in the same place # so# I just have to get used to it.  What do you want to do about dinner?
Okay. We'll see you later then.	Yeah. Bye.
That bag's almost empty.	No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.
What did he say?	Nothing new. He's just going off duty.
I should go get some of her things.	No, let me go.
You've got to stop doing that?	Doing what?
Did you get a hold of that horse guy?	Yeah.
I don't understand. You just said he said no.	He did, but# I think I can change his mind.
No. It's, uh# No, I really don't think it's a good idea	Why?!
What if she doesn't want to go?	She will if you think she should.
I miss you, Annie.	I know. We miss you too.
You were right about coming here. I'm sorry for not thinking#	No, it's okay. Believe me, there were plenty of times I didn't know what the hell was right.
I have so much to tell you.	You want to take a walk with me?
There's coffee inside# I was just bringing this to Tom.	Would you mind if I did? I'd like to talk to him.
What?	Annie, I'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time.
I think I'm going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave. Just might be his first broken heart.	Oh, how sweet.
He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.	That's what some folks say.
I don't believe it.	You know her?
Tom?	Yeah.
Would you let me ride your horse?	Have you talked to Tom about it?
Isn't it like, obvious?	Not to me. Either you want to or you don't.
Can you drive?	Drive? I'm not old enough yet.
I can't#	I don't have all day.
Just follow this. Nothing to it. I'm going to shut my eyes here for a little while. Just keep going till you run out of road.	I don't know if I can.
I can't# not yet#	There's no hurry. Take you time.
Sure?	Sure.
Grace, I need you to come with me.	No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
#Oh, come on! You think the same thing!	I just could never say it!
Do you want to go around by the old road?	Why don't we just cut through the woods?
Dad! I can do it, OK?!	OK, OK.
Do you want something else, honey? We order something else?	No, I'm just not that hungry.
You want to watch some television?	Maybe# look -- just#
Honey, you all right? Did something fall?	NO!
Shouldn't we have invited Tom over?	I did. He said he had work to do until late.
IT WAS MY TURN!	YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.
Don't be such a baby!	You just showing off for her!
I can't believe it's the same horse.	We still have a way to go.
What are you looking at, young man?	How long were you married?
Well, that'll happen.	Where did you learn all this stuff?
Secret Service!	Don't move!
Let's keep her.	Waste the dude.
So what do you think, can I crash at your place tonight?	What is it with this guy?
Dead.	Dead?
I found it! I found it!	This is the end, my friend.  Thank you for calling!
Oh, shit! He got me.	Joey's getting stupid busy.
Yes!	We did it!
Here's your class.	My# class. You mean I'm not in your class?
He's not in this class.	I said give me time.
What the hell are you doing?	It's cool, I'm just looking.
What is it with you? I know we've been playing games, but, we're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help. I really need your help.	I'm sorry, I can't.
Thank you.	Okay. I'll copy it.
Why did he come to you?	I got a record. I was Zero Cool.
Ready?	Yeah.
Are you crazy? What are you doing?	I'm trying to help you.
Oh, wow, she's great.	Yeah.
You look good in a dress.	You would have looked better.
Hello?	We caught 'em.
What is he doing in here?	Relax, Burn, he's my guest.
Hello?	Hey, it's me.
We need to talk.	Okay sure. What about?
Are you two okay?	We've been better.
Is there another key?	I don't know!
How do we look?	You guys always look great.
Honey, I don't think their home.	How do you know their not?
I don't want to have anyone live through that night again.	I've said this before. I think your the one who needs medical help.
Why shouldn't I?	How many people in the bus?
Night Doc.	Drive Carefully.
What the hell did this?	Looks to me like your out of business. Now I want some answers.
Sure it does.	I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.
Hi.	You ready for some Ice Cream?
What are you doing out here alone?	Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
You don't believe that do you?	No.
Why don't you go make some coffee.	All right.
Call me.	Okay, bye.
Hell of a night.	Its not over yet.
Something?	He's been here.
Is that him? Is that him?	Yes.
Oh Christ. Doc#	Dear God.
Oh Christ. They wouldn't have given up without a fight.	They didn't know what they were fighting.
Why didn't you wait for me?	We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.
Shit!	I have a place for that.
Look.	Look where?
Well, home sweet home. I'll see you later.	Okay. Bye.
Hello?	Why did you hang up on me?
I hate that dog. I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like.	What's this big, big news?
You'll have to. He's calling you tomorrow to find out what time to pick you up.	Annie!
You locked yourself in.	I know. Pull my legs. I'm stuck.
I'm scared.	Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?
Yes.	Come with me.
That's great. Now you'll be too drunk to#	Just answer the damn phone.
Fantastic. Totally.	Yeah.
My parents won't be back till ten.	Are you sure?
We're all alone, aren't we?	Michael's around someplace#
I gotta go.	Will you call me tomorrow?
I'd like to talk to you, if I could.	May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here#
Ten minutes.	I'll be here.
A man wouldn't do that#	He isn't a man.
What do we do?	He was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. I'm going to wait for him.
Jesus!	You all right?
Annie, some day you're going to get us all in deep trouble.	Totally.
Are you coming over tonight?	Same time, same place.
I gotta go. I'll see you tonight.	See you.
Not any more.	Why are they under there?
Who is it?	Tommy, let me in!
Are you sure?	Yes.
I'm scared!	There's nothing to be scared of now. Get changed.
I'm not responsible, Sam.	Of course not.
Oh, good#	Come in, come in.
I love that.  That's my type.	I can't believe it!
Hi.	Oh.
That's just --	Look at this.
Yeah.	A lot of works.
Uh, who gets dropped first?	Uh --
I know.  It's terrible!	I mean, I've looked everywhere.
Oh!	Oh, is that what it is?
It's French, though.  It really is.	Yeah.
Well#we have seen a lot of stuff today, though.	Yeah.
Uh#	It depends on what way you want to go.
We got that idea on that trip to Paris.	Right.
Yeah.	What time do you get off?
Yeah.	It's terrific!
Yeah.	Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
Oh, gee, I don't know.  Um#	Well#
So what's the, uh, problem this time?	This time I really think I have something.
How ya doin', man?	I told him about your work, and he's very excited.
We--	#cannot go on the air.
Like, uh#?	I don't know exactly.
I'll never understand it.  You're so bright and charming and beautiful.	Oh, God.
Yes.	Everything's okay? 
Yeah.  How are you?	I'm#all right.
Page a hundred and twelve.	Bye.
Oh!	What are you doing?!
I thought you weren't coming.	I almost didn't.
This is not an easy situation.	I know it isn't.
You've been very cold to me tonight.	No.
But it hasn't been forever. 	It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which#I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.
They're fantastic.	Aren't they great?
Great idea.	I know.
Oh, let's not--I, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.	Are you angry with me?
Hi.  How's she doing?	I am glad to see you.
Don't make it worse, Dad.	Always.
I want ice!  Who's got some--  Oh, there it is.	It's on the table, Dad.
Oh, Mom!	Oh, honey!
I don't understand.  I thought that you would be happy.	How can we be happy?
Want some coffee or tea?	No, thank you.
How about something to eat?	No, nothing.
Are you sure?	Absolutely.
You know, you've been very nervous lately.	I can't take this anymore.
Oh, Christ!  What's wrong with you?!	I'm sorry.
But you, God, you knew that was going to happen sooner or later.  I can't live like this!	Who is it?
Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.	You know# 
Look at this guy.	Yeah?
Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!	I can't keep my mind on the show.
Yeah.  What?	Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you a secret?
Oh, great.	You look so beautiful.
Oh, yeah?	He was, he's just as crazy as ever. He was on his way to get a blood test. 
I hope you tell her it was your idea#	Why?
So how are you?	Oh, me, I'm okay.
I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but#	Oh, no!  I mean, everyone thinks things like that.
Hi!  Hi!	I know#I know.
Yeah, aren't you like, you know#	Huh?
How is everything?	Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
Come on!  Hurry up!  Let's go!	Wow!
Gee.	Is there no chance?
This is the second opinion.	Well, then a third opinion.
What?  You're kidding!	No, no, we decided!
Doesn't she look great in that new dress?	Yeah.
Don't you think she does?	She really does, though.
Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why.	Look, everything's going your way.
Hey, what's the matter?	I'm real upset about what you wrote.
Well, why don't you share them with us?	I don't#I don't want to bother everyone.
Don't, no, please.  Will you-- No, don't#	You want some?
Can we, can we go?	No!
Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work out.	Yeah.  Me, too.
I'd never do that.	#in a really horrible way.
So how are you?	I'm okay.
You're okay, though, huh?	I'm-- Yes.  Yes, I'm fine.  I'm fine.  How are you?
Oh, well, God, I can imagine what you wrote.	Oh, no!  It wasn't anything bad. But she just# you know.  I don't know.
Really?	So, uh#I threw it out, but I have this other one.
So, so you want to go out to dinner again?  I mean, is that, is that# Have, you have any interest in that, or#	Sure.  Sure, uh, yes.
Now don't get nervous.  It's just your husband.	Hi.
Dad#	Oh#
Hi.	#which I did not get.
Oh, please!  We all came to have lunch, didn't we?	Yeah, okay, right.  Forget it.  What's to eat?
Aren't you glad to see me?	Tell me about your trip# what did you bring me#?
I can't think.	#you don't have to think.
What, What, I can't hear you#	Are you alright#?
Hold up a minute#	You spend the afternoon in Bed?
Why would you say that?  Because he sent me in there to be killed#?  What is this#?	#what's he got against you?
Waited too long, hon#?  	How's your child?
I said how's your baby#?	You want to hold him#?
My husband brought it to me from America.	A wonderful country#
How wonderful of you, to hold that information in your busy mind#	#how so?
And?  Then?	I wonder no longer.  You were out of the country.
Darling#	Well, if you will excuse me.  Madame. What a pleasure.
And you let her get away.	Sir, with all due respect#.
#may be the heat#.	Let's get her out of here#.
Can you walk?  Are your legs working#?	Perhaps# shall we see#?
You look lovely.	Thank you.  No, I know you'd prefer "I'm glad you find me so#"
#I'm sorry#.?	#we were speaking of my father#
The girl could use some help.	You're free#
#when I# 	#what has she done to harm you#?
You should get Married.	That's what I should do.  Tell me why?
Because you're going to help me plan a party.	You're going to do that?
What was it.  What was it, honey?	#something about my father#?
Give me your gun#	#what#?
#my love#	#they asked us to dinner.  How can we accept if we cannot return the#
Ask me when we get home.	Oh, my program#
Hello#.?	#what did you want? 
She must be something special After Dark.	I can't remember.  I've got to make some money.
Yes.	What does that mean?
I'll bet you're glad I waited until the last day to have this conversation.	You have no idea. Now run away.
Now what? What did I do this time?	I just wanted to know if you've seen this.
Man, she's losing it#	It's about time. Isn't Fun great?
What are you doing?	Nothing.
Do you really not believe in God?	It's okay, there's a lot of things I don't believe in#
Fuck off.	I should leave. You probably need your rest.
Are you allowed to do it more than once a night?	It's been known to happen.
Ah, our last night at camp#I always knew it would be something special.	What do you want me to say?
God, you're beautiful.	Thank you, my love.                                         ]
I missed you. I know I'm not as, as exciting as your other friends.	That's bullshit. Just shoot.
I'm sorry? I don't get it.	You did last night.
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I smoke these damn things?	Because you're an idiot.
Things are going to change, Earl.	Uh-huh.
Anyway, I can say never to high school. I've got David.	King David.
Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.	Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus#
Maybe you should see a doctor.	Yeah, maybe.
No way, no day!	Give it up girl!
What were you trying to do? Sleep?	Suicide is a private thing.
It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends.	I don't really like your friends either.
It doesn't work on small animals!	Oh.
Did you miss him completely?	Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on#.
We killed them, didn't we?	Of course.
Can't you see this is a special moment?	I was just making it more special.
Is it sleeping, dude?	I think so, man.
Hello!	Well? Tell us! How'd it go?
You have it.	Oh, no. I'm watching my figure.
Look, Mother!	looks down at the ground in front of her.
I think I'm dying . . .	Don't . . . please! Please, don't!
To be known as He!	He . . .
Him.	Him . . .
This.	This . . .
That.	That . . .
What?	It's so beautiful!
You'll never guess what's happened!!	What??
How do you know? Did he tell you?	Well . . . no. But it's so obvious.
I'm coming with you.	Yes . . .
Of course, yes.	The way you just looked at me#
Sure plenty of times.	Well?
Must be nice.	What?
You could say that.	Zero's a number right?
Good boy.  Where's is it?	What?
You win! Okay pull over.	But# I thought#
Oh my God. It's coming out.	What?
And besides, I thought, to hell with it# it's okay if you only married me for my money.	Really, why's that?
Sorry I'm in your seat aren't I?	No please make yourself at home.
Hey buddy!	# but I'm starting to think I was# I was going to#
What do you want?!	Who the hell are you talking to?
You mean# when the car went off the bridge?	Wow you are out of it.  
You okay?	I'm, uh, not sure# Feeling kind of weird actually.
You should give it to someone with only one leg.	One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something?
I just wanna talk with you for a minute.  Then you can jump.  You can jump twice for all I care.	Talk from there.  You can talk from there.
What is it, five days now I don't see you!	'Cause I'm up to my ass in shit is why.  I'm broke, plus I got legal problems# Nobody was asking for me, huh?
I didn't even know you had a kid.	The thing about kids is, they're so# young!  They don't know nothin' yet.  When you're a kid, you think you're gonna grow up an' be a "wonderful person" instead of an asshole, like everybody else.
Here.  Get off here.	Thanks.  Thanks, pal.
Uh, er# I#	You were saying you don't want a million dollars.
I# no# I don't have the right# I#	No, I don't have the right.  You're a news story!
What're we talking about?  Reach out for what?	I told them how you were upset we didn't save the guy#
We're gonna wait here?  The guy could be hours.	Maybe, maybe not.  I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
She wants to quit?	She can't quit.
My father didn't have his shoes on when he# when he came here.	You were in bed.  Weren't you?
Hi, Chief.  You like the suicide?	Never reach out!
Hey, c'mon.	They're really white.
Things are beginning to come to a head.  I can feel it.  And I want everything to be perfect.	Who doesn't?
Oh, great.	Yeah, that was easy.
Do you have a family?	Uh, no -- I've never really found the time to settle down.
I was driving by -- I saw all the cars.  Are you all right?	Yeah, I'm okay -- it's been a long night.
Yeah, right -- I really have to go to bed.	I think we should talk first.
About what?	About us.
Your daddy and I are kind of mad at each other right now, so we have to spend some time apart.	Why are you mad at each other?
Mommy!	It's okay, baby, the police are coming.
C'mon, kids, let's go.	"We don't want to be late for our first day of school."
Where'd he go?	He's staying with a friend.  Hurry up now, you'll be late for school.
I hear what you're saying, but I know what you're thinking.	What?
Did you hear that?	What?
How was lunch?	Huh?
Do you remember who gave us this?	No.
I thought we'd be happy here.	Honey, I'm sorry, I think the vacation will be a good break for both of us.  You'll see.
The cab's waiting!	Where should I hide the car keys?
What -- what are you doing?	I think you should feel like dancing at a time like this.
Honey?  How did it go?  You didn't call me.	He wasn't there.
Who was that?	I'm having the floor fixed,
Oh God.	Yeah -- we know him.  He's been hanging around the house.
Should I come home when I'm finished there?	We'll talk in the morning.
God, your sister's really hot.	Shut up.
Shit!	Put it out, man!
Are we gonna buy this house?	Do you have enough money?
You knew a second ago.  Who started it?	-- A man.
Do you see a man?	No.
I thought I was supposed to stay in my room.	Get on the other side of that.
And this -- is the master bedroom.	Oh yeah?  Where's the bed?
Is it a king or a queen?	It's a double.
Promise?	Promise.
I'd like that.	Would you?
Really?	Really.
What the hell.  What is this?  A joke?	No joke, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant?	What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
You didn't see this.  Understand?	Yes.
Did you find a sword?  An old sword?	Yeah -- how'd you know that?
When did you get back?	A few days ago.
Where were you last night around nine?	I already told you.  I took a walk.
She was a good woman.	You didn't bring me here to talk about her.
I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?	No.
Most people would show some sign of fear with a gun in their face.	Most people are afraid of death.
Yes -- I think it is.	Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
Must you do that?	What?
Life.  You've stopped living it.  You look, but you do not see.  You listen but, you do not hear.	I hear you.
The river.	That's all?
I'm leaving.	Leaving what?
Thank you, Thomas.	For what?
What are we doing here?	Living.  Remember?
To ask her to dance.	She's the King's cousin.
You've been seeing her for over a month now.  Have you learned nothing from the past?	I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
Well?	It's done.
I'll go first.	No -- I will.
You can go first.	No -- after you.
This cannot be.	It is.  Do not ask me how.  I do not know.  I must leave, for if I stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come.
I cannot stay.	Why not?
Leaving?  For how long?	You'll no see me again.
Why?	I cannot explain.
Yes.  How did you know?	A lucky guess.
You're hurt.	I'll be fine.
I don't have any answers for you.	Who was that man last night?
Do you always walk around with a sword?	New York is dangerous place.
No.	You look like you have.
Good evening.	You're twenty minutes late.
You didn't answer my question.	I know.
I'm just trying to place you.	I've lived all over the world.
Would you like to see it?	I've seen it.
You wanted the truth -- now you have it.	And the other one -- he is like you?
Where will you go now?	It will end tonight.
He's in there!	Get out.
What now?	Now I can start to live.  To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another.
We found him this morning.	What's that next to him?
Do you?  Then why don't you go out? Meet someone.  Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?	I like my work.
You know it's not safe here for you.	I know.
Is there anything else you need?	No -- I'm fine.  Thank you.
You kept it?	Yes.
What are you doing?	I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake.
Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?	I think he's dead!
Put our people on the scene.  Smith might talk just to cut a break for his kids.	He knows better than that.
Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end of the day, I want to own him.	It's happening right now.
There's fuckin' blood all over you!	I didn't know he would have a gun!  It just went off!
That's why we gotta keep going.  I'm not gonna go in for murder.	We're on foot.  We can't get away.
I have to tell you something --	We gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
Jesus.  What is this?	Are you totally stupid?  What does it look like?
We can't carry all this.  It's too heavy.	I've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.
We're fucked.	We're fucked until we think of a way out; then we're rich.
If we don't escape, we gotta get the word out about the cash.  That's how we'll stay alive.	What are you talking about?
It's over.  We have to give up.	Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.
Then we might as well die rich.	I'm not going to die for this!
We're cool.	Let me speak to Mr. Smith.  I want to hear it from him.
You've been in there a long time. What're you waiting for?	Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
You picked a bad house to hole up in, son.	Two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
Who else is here?	My father.
He needs a doctor.	Shut up and sit down.  You think someone's gonna make a house call?
My father needs a doctor.  Please.	Hey, I've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.
What about my father?	Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
What the fuck is that?	They'll cut the power.
What if it goes south?	What do you mean?
They're close.  Let me make a call.  You can see they're okay.	You said they would be here!
You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not talk to them; have them.	Where is it?
I need to work out some stuff.	You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
Can we talk some more when you get here?	We'll see you in a couple of hours.
I should've called.  This thing broke right after we spoke, then everything happened so fast --	Don't worry about it.  How are you doing?
We can't carry him.	You go, Thomas.  You get out, and I'll stay with Daddy.
He can't reach us in here.  We're safe.	I know.
Want one?	I don't drink beer.
What?	We're hungry.  You're going to cook.
Now we can do whatever we want.	Stop it.
Thanks for the shirt.	Whatever.
What do you want?	Keep your voice down.  I'm taking you and your brother out of here.
What's going on?	Get in the car.  Now.
Smith!  Wake up!	What are you doing?!  Stop that!
I'm not going to wake him.  I don't even know that I can.	Just one question.  Please.
That's enough.	Another minute.  Please --
That's not enough.	What's that, Chief?  Say again.
Chief, base.	Go.
He says that his father's hurt.	If we have a man dying in there, we'll have to go in.
You want me to stick around, I could --	You've been here all day, Chief.  Take a break.  See your family.  If I need you, I'll call.
Okay, here's mine.  My name is Special Agent Jones.	Are all of you named Jones?
In a few minutes the white phone is going to ring.  So let's get our shit straight before that happens.	You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.
We've got to get those kids out of there!	Not until the man calls.
The kids are in here!	Where's the office?
Where are my children?	They're still in the house.
I don't know what you're talking about.	He's going to kill you.  Don't you know that?  He can't take the chance that you'll talk.
Where's your gun?	I'm the Chief.  I don't carry it.
Can we let go?  You past your shock and all that, we can turn you loose and you won't do something stupid?	You can let go.
I guess we each have something the other wants.	I guess we do.
Paul, we would like to speak to you in your office.	We, who is we?
Paul#  #I have to talk to you.	I'll be back.
Captain, I must take my family. It is not safe here.	Where is your family?
Please, I don't use guns.	There is nothing to it.
Ten.	And four children?
Where are they going?	They can go where they want. They are in charge now.
We are better here.	Listen, you need me.
You lie.	If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
Time is money, George. We need extra beer today.	Business is good at the hotel?
Let's go.	Take the river road back. It is clear.
Holy shit! Holy shit.	What is it?
You fucking see that!	Oh my God!
Great, I really need a shower.	Just give me a moment to get your keys.
Get out of this room and get back to work.	I don't have to listen to you anymore.
Are you sure this is the river road?	I saw the sign.
Give her what she wants, room, food, anything. Charge it all. Don't you put her out, Paul.	I would never do that.
You are the manager?	Yes, sir. What is wrong?
Who did you call?	Call, sir?
Excuse me.	What?
Terrible times, Paul. There are bodies everywhere. I cannot stay here.	I need a great favor.
I'm afraid you will have to move room.	Move? Where to?
They should go one truck at a time. When the first truck gets through to the airport, then the others will follow.	We can't wait. We all go together or not at all.
Do something.	What?
No.	We must do something.
Oh, my God!	Where are you hurt, son?
What is it, Paul.	Stay with the children.
Paul, don't let them die.	Get in.
Them. They almost got us all killed. I have done enough for them! We cannot look after them anymore.	What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.
This won't do.	It will do just fine.
Any luck?	No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.
My sister is dead, Paul. They would not leave the children.	No. They are not dead. Stop this.
Go to the roof now.	What for Paul.
I have to go out to get food.	Go out! Where?
Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the roof?	It's alright. This is the only place I can find some peace.
I hear we must pay for everything. How much for this?	A kiss.
I have to stay.	No! Sit down now.
Let me go. Children get off.	I will follow on the next plane. Go.
I love you. Keep the children safe.	Paul! Then another voice.
We are almost out of water.	We are almost out of everything.
We have to have a plan.	What sort of plan?
Twelve are dead.	How dead?
What is this about no water?	It's true, sir, the water has been turned off.
Out? Where are you going?	I do not know, sir. I think they will kill us all.
Paul, are you there?	Yes, thank you Mr. President.
Something just must've#frightened her, that's all.	Yeah#something.
Don't think it'll be a problem.	C'mon.
There must be some other way out.	Well, until that's found, I think it's a good idea we all stick together.  Or wouldn't that fit into your plans, baby?
What?	Is she alright?
Where is it??	I don't know!!
This thing's going nowhere.	If this is someone's idea of a joke --
Yeah, what the hell, I'll go.	Yeah, me too.
-- I did: down here.	And I think that's case --
You said that was an accident.	I lied. The House is alive and we're all gonna die.
What's in there?	Nothing.
Oh. Jesus.	Poor Mr. Price --
If you know where it is, get there!	Me? You've gotta be kidding.
I'll meet you down there.	Take the gun.
Is she#alright?	I thought she was dead. For sure.
Thanks.	Most fun I've had all day.
What? Deep down inside?	Start with the name you were born with, and we'll work forward from there.
You hear somebody?	No -- keep pulling, it's moving!
I was upstairs with Eddie --	-- that's the fact, bud --
-- you lose either way, Price --	-- listen to the man --
I think we should have taken a right back there.	Back where?
Good point.	Let's try down here#
This is the best we're gonna do.	It'll have to do.
Price!!	He's gotta still be down here.
It's okay, everything's okay now.	He's dead#?
Don't think it's even an issue.	We're safe?
What --	-- was that??
Where did it go?	Run.
What?	Jesus!
So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that?	I hope not.
You think this is fucking funny??	No, no, it's just --
Business or pleasure, Mr. Price?	My wife. Where were we?
Do something!	Like what?? This isn't supposed to be happening!!
I think#I may have the answer.	What?
What is it??	Something with the power, I don't know!!
I was upstairs!	I never saw you --
Then tell me, please -- help me#!	Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
Wish I could take the credit, but --	-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
Oh, no.	What's going on?
Don't know that it does.	Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
Won't do any good.	Why not?
Price!	Oh, dear.
-- hey! --	-- ten.
-- Eddie!!	Over here.
Damn it.	What's the matter?
They don't build them like this anymore.	Suppose not.
Town records are coming up now.	What will they tell you?
I have to admit you really have a beautiful home.	Thank you.  If you told me two years ago we'd be living here, I would never have believed it.  Do you live around here?
Did you find her?!	No!
Are you all right?	A few years older, perhaps.
Don't play games with me, little girl.	I didn't do anything, mommy.
It's going to hurt us!	No it won't - no it won't!
She's down#	She's down#how do you mean honey?
Are we leaving mommy?	Yes, we'll be leaving soon.
Where are we going to go, mommy?	We're going to go someplace new.
Oh my God, what happened to you? My baby -	I'm ok mommy.
She says she's lonely#	Where is she?
She's down.  Help her#	Take me to her.
Help me!  Please!!!	My God, I heard something!
Can I have this room daddy?	Sure.  Did you see the others?
Look daddy!  It's empty!	That's great, honey.
Mommy please help me!	Don't be afraid!
Oh my God!  She's in there!	Daddy help!
Are we going back to California daddy?	Well, that all depends.
I could use a little help. We have to return the van soon.	Ok ok#we're just gonna head inside here#
It's just going to take a while.	Whatever you say.
To our family.	To our family.
I wish I knew more about her.	Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
What the hell is that?	I don't know.  That's strange.
#set up some more things.	Ok.
But do you agree with me?	Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
Whoa there#	Are you ok?
How are we doing?	I think everything's ready.
Oh my God where is she!	She's gone!
I'm fine.	Ok#
You don't think I know?	Know what?
Do you think I'm a fool?	What?
We'll destroy you#destroy all of you!	No#  NO!
Are you all right?	I'm ok.
Where is your daughter?  She might be able to give us some information.	She's at school.  We've tried not to upset her more than she's been.
Thank you.  I believe she would have wanted it.	Did you know her very well?
Your daughter's been taken.	What!
I'm going to need some blood.  It must be from a woman.	Why?
She's coming back.  Keep talking!	Come back to us honey!
Did you have dinner, father?  We have plenty.	Well thank you for the offer,  But I really have to go.
Well there's no time like the present.  Good night.	Good night.
How long will it take!	It will not take long#
Take care of the girl.  Take care of your family.  They are important.	Yes, they are.
There's something in there.	What?
Not on station time.	No.  Not on station time.  My story.  My time.
Hello?	You wanted a story.  You got it.  Turn on the TV now.  And then get your ass down here #  #
Something bad.	And why are you back?  Why are we here?
Hold on.  Hold on, please.  I need talk to you.	It's nothing to do with me.  I wasn't even with him.
Look, lady!  I told you!  It's not my problem!  I was just there!	Where?
You like # left me a card?  At the club?	Right.  Right!
Right # So # Well, what do you want?	I want to talk to you.  We met # now, listen, don't hang up, OK? # We met at the hospital last night.
Yeah.  Sure.  You mean # tonight?	Of course tonight.  Is that a problem? Like, if you've got a guy there or something #
What?	Your dream.  You said you were having a bad dream.
# well, I've been having it for years. It's not a nightmare or anything.  It's # well, I know what it is.	What is it?
Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?	I'm trying to quit.
How have you # ?	Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
# but it is good.  You know, over to the left, you can #	Who's that?
Jesus.  Are you sure this is the street?	Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?
For somebody else, alright?  Not for me. I don't do that shit anymore.	Then you shouldn't even be around it. You know, it's #
Never mind.  I'm glad it's gone.  Made the store feel strange.  Who'd make such a thing?	Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
Yes really.	Wow.  Thank you.
It doesn't bother me.  I'm just not interested.	Oh.  Like I'm not an interesting person.
But you gave me a rose #	And tomorrow I'll give one to somebody else.  Get dressed.  Get out.
Joey?	Not quite.
Yeah right.  How'd you get this number?	Will you relax?  Your little girlfriend left a card, remember?
I don't think so.  Not yet.  I'm not ready yet.	Sure.  Sure.  I understand.  It's cool. I mean, we've got all night.
Count of three?	Why not just go now?
Now that's a lock.	Don't worry, we'll get it#
That was close#.	Anna, I think you better stay#.
What the hell#.	You're supposed to be dead!
No, let me!	I don't care.
Don't be stupid#they#	Bastard!  If you were a true American.
Why does this have to be so hard#	Tell me about it#
#You know! For kids!	#Why don't I just type this up#
Yeah, I think I've heard of that. What goes around comes around.	That's it. A great wheel that gives us each what we deserve#
Just got hired today!	Terrific.
Oh, uh# Buzz# Is it important?	I like to think so! It's this little idea I been working on!
Aw, please, sir -- this job, it's all I got!	Get up!
-- Uh# Buzz, I'm sorry, I -- Buzz, you gotta forgive me! I shouldn't a fired you, I didn't know what I was doing! I was a little funny in the head, I --	Aw, buddy, I don't care about that.
#You don't?	Nah, that's all forgotten.
#This'll only take a moment.	Yeah?
#Who let you in?	I --
Tell him I'll be right there#  Well, what is it?	I --
But --	Get out of my sight.
Not that way! Through the door!	But, sir!
She's got other problems, of course#	#Her mother needs an operation#
Maybe he's wise.	He don't look wise.
She isn't!	She is!
I think you need some help.	I'm afraid so.
You're single?	Yes.
Where do you think you're going?	It's my day off.
Can't I take it for you?	No, thank you.  Tomorrow's time enough for you to begin work.
I heard someone crying -- a woman --	A woman crying?  No one's been crying here.
I made it clear in my letter to the company.  This is not a position for a frightened girl.	I am not a frightened girl.
I suppose so.  Yes.	And charming?
I heard you playing.	I often do.
I wanted to help you.	Help me? How?
I still can't believe it Paul -- that you wouldn't say a word in your own defense.	I have no defense.  So far as I know -- it is true.
I tell you he hasn't and he wouldn't dare use it if he had.	Why?
Then again, why should she be? I mean with us, with our#	So maybe you'll come too?
Good night.	Good night.
I'm, uh, going to bed.	So early?
You crying?	I'm just sad Ben -- I mean it was# you were, but, you know. I just don't know#
Dinner in ten minutes.	You go dry off now.
Don't start.	You think I --
You've#	In the car.
This just isn't the best moment for this.	I know, I know. I had no idea --
Ready to go?	We're not going anywhere.
Do you think? Maybe we should call someone --	The phone's out.
Oh you know, for a minute I thought it was --	Paul? Yeah. You think --
Hi dad.	Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
See you.	Stay out of trouble.
Dad stop it!	Get to sleep young lady -- and I mean it.
I'm picking up Paul at the station - want to come?	Nah.
What the hell are you kids doing down here?	What do you think we're doing, dad?
Talking to me, dad?	Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
He's probably been waiting all night at the station.	C'mon.
We don't have to always go to your club, dad.	And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
But#	But what?
And to think -- they met at a key party of all things.	A key party?
Now don't make me feel as if I'm being too forward, OK? If you don't --	What the hey. Let's go for a drive.
You okay?	Yeah. You?
You want to come in, get a cup of coffee -- warm up? I can either walk you home, or you could crash in the guest room.	Sure. Maybe coffee.
I don't like coffee.	It'll warm you up.
Please don't.	It's not a bother.
Oh.	It's really quite all right.
I'm thinking of going back to school.	Social work?
No more man. I'm about to drop as it is.	See ya.
How can you do that man?	Do what?
Jesus, Jim!	Sorry honey. Hell, we've got to trade this thing in for a normal bed.
Hey.  I'll take this stuff.	You going to tell dad?
Well, uh, I don't, it's really --	What is it?
Maybe you should have just a half.	Thanks for the advice dad.
Where you going?	Out.
I don't ever want to see you.	Then why'd you come after me?
You have to follow me?	I dunno. I --
Maybe we can mess around. You know, only if you want to#	I don't know.
You're parents at that party?	Yeah. Yours?
It feels warm.	One more shot?
I love you.	That's nice. Are you drunk?
Yes, sir.	That's all, for now.
Will, you can't blame yourself.	I had him!
I have to get back.	Too bad#
This murder was in the papers, right?	Yeah.  All over.
Oh, I shouldn't have#	It's okay.  Happened a long time ago.  He was killed in a fire.  In New Mexico.
No.  But I covered it up.  I lied.	Why?
Sorry about#	Where is he?
What are you doing here?	I told her to come.
I'll call him now.	First I need a copy of the key.
Good.	And something else that might interest you.
She wasn't happy.  I was someone to talk to.	How do you mean?
Eight years.	Seven years.
What do you want to talk about?	You know what about.
Well her mother didn't buy them for her.	What are we thinking?
Your friend's all business.	I'm always all business.
Will#I#	What is it?
Did you love her?	Huh?
I don't know what you're fucking talking about.	Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?
I don't know.	You don't know.
I was her best friend.	Best friend?
You want me to take you somewhere?	Long as it's fun.
Hey#	Thought you wanted something fun#
I don't know.	You don't know.
It was like some big fucking secret!	What was?
I'm sorry?	I said you're going to get a phone call.
Down at the station?	Yes down at the station.
No.	But you wanted to.
What about him?	He.  Well, he#
I thought maybe we could talk some more.	There's nothing more to talk about.
I told you that was an accident!	Then so was mine#
Yes.  Like that.	This an accident, Walter?
Wild card.	Drop the gun, Walter.
So you have the answers#	Ah! You have questions?
The one who made you should have told you this. The one who left the old world for the new#	He knew nothing. He just didn't care.
I was waiting for you#	Listen to me.
Are these not the answers you came for?	Yes# My God#
You didn't even warm them, did you?	No.
Why always on this night?	What night? What do you mean?
Which of you did it? Which of you made me the way I am?	What you are? You would be something other than you are?
You made us what we are, didn't you?	Stop her Louis!
Why yours alone? Tell me how it was done!!!!	Be glad I made you what you are! You'd be dead not if I hadn't.
I want more.	What have you done?
You see the old woman? That will never happen to you. You'll never grow old. You will never die.	And it means something else too, doesn't it? I shall never, ever grow up.
But now's the time to end it, Louis. Now's the time to leave him.	He'll never let us go.
Louis, look at me.	I can't. Go away from me.
How do I look?	Still my beautiful child.
A beautiful child! Is that what you still think I am?	Yes#
You want me to be your daughter forever, don't you?	Yes.
Do you think I would let them harm you?	No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
They would have killed you -	Then my luck would have changed.
Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?	And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?
You're not afraid of anything, are you?	Why should I be?
You have to ask me for this. You have to want it, do you hear me?	Give it to me!!!
Let's call that a start.	I can't do it.
You really want to be with them?	Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
Did I hear a yes?	Yes#
You're sure?	Sure#
You're body's dying. Pay no attention. It will take twenty minutes at most.	Dying?
Come, you're going to feed now.	I want a woman.
You must get into it. It's the only safe place for you when the light comes.	And if I don't?
I know. It gets cold so fast.	We can live like this? Off the blood of animals?
Have you ever been caught?	Of course not. It's so easy you almost feel sorry for them.
We belong in hell.	And what if there is no hell, or they don't want us there? Ever think of that?
Unless I make her one of us#	NO!!!
My God# to think you# are all I have to learn from#	In the old world, they called it the dark gift, Louis. And I gave it to you.
No# You come back to me Louis#	Are you mad????
You were going to kill me? Drink my blood?	Yes but you needn't worry about that now. Things change.
Shall we go on?	He did it to make you stay with him!
But why did you tell her?	How could I not? She had to know.
No# it can't end like that#	But it has. There is no more to tell.
You promise to care for her then?	Yes#
And the child who did die?	My daughter#
Listen to me. He's here.	Who? Who is here?
You'll go away with you're college friends, but you won't go away with me?	Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.
I don't know, man. Maybe we should keep going, find a phone --	No.
Get lost, you scared me.	Fish are all over the water#Come on, let us take a boat out.
There's nothing between Will and me.	Yet. Nothing yet.
Say yes.	No.
Oh!	Hey, sorry#  He's my friend, too. And that ticket is not going to waste.
I'm the King of the World.	No, I'm the King of the World.
Hello? Hello?	Where is everyone? I'll ask --
No way.	Yes.
You get any sleep at all?	Some.
Cancer in a box.	No, this is the safe sun.  It's better than a day at the beach.
Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed him. Now, get over it. We gotta think here.	They never found the body.
There's no way to lock it.	What do we do?
I don't know#	Come on, you can make it.
I'm holding your hand!	No, you're not.
Oh, god, it's you --	You're okay. Thank god.
I got in early. I was excited#  Who was that guy?	Oh, that's Will. He's a friend. You'd like him.
Ray, I can't#	Can't what?
I understand something.	It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be.  It just isn't.
Hey. I'm really glad you called# I'm sorry.	No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --
Okay, I'll try. But, listen#  If I don't make it up, then you go ahead and have a great time.	Ray#please try. I really miss you.  Okay. Bye.
Ray#what are you doing?	Oh#it's not working right. You're home early.  Did I scare you?
I love it here.	It's gonna be great.
We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one.	Who?
The shower again?	It was in a church#it was so real. I mean, I could feel his breath on me.
This was not my idea.	What?
Oh, Will! I'm sorry.	It's my fault. I shouldn't have#I didn't think#
What? What are you talking about? Where?	It's in my room!
Come on. We're gonna be okay.	Did you get help?
Why are you doing this to me?	Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it.	I'll talk real slow.
Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me.	Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance.
Is there a problem here?	Where there's a Will, there's a way. Come on.
Ain't nothin' free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true.  I wanted you all to have a good trip.	We will, baby#All this means is we got the whole island to ourselves.
Pretty cool bar.	They all start to look the same once you've worked in one.  Am I right, sister?
You sure you didn't pick up my hair tie?	Hello?
I'll come with you.	Are you crazy? We're not staying here on our own.
To a great weekend --	Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather!
Why? He can't help us.	He's probably the only one who can help us.
You guys lost?	Tell me this ain't the bar scene.
What's the matter, boy trouble?	Not anymore.
I'm sorry, but you could've been the one doing all of this --	And so could you -- crazy fool.
Take this.	And do what with it?
Goodbye.	May life be good to you both. As for the others  they will be quiet here  and I will be with them.
What are you doing?	I was looking for you.
I felt he did not like me.	That should decide it or you --
I'm a woman -- a lonely woman. I have few friends.	Yes?
There is something evil about her.	Oh, now  now look here 
It makes me fear her.	I can't understand that.
Until we know, what choice is there? We have to stay.	But the war, the army  they need you.
Come on, we got to get this up. He's coming.	Who?
You what? To save me?	Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go through with it, did you?
By letting me help you.	Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
What'd you say?	I said I wish I'd never been born.
You have no car.	Well, I had a car, and it was right here. I guess somebody moved it.
What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before.	You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
Clarence . . .	Yes, George?
I . . .	If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
She's . . .	Where is she?
Poor George . . . Sit down.	Sit down? What are . . .
What did you stop it for?	I want you to take a good look at that face.
You sent for me, sir?	Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
Is this the place?	Of course it's the place.
Well?	Mother . . .
Well, sure I do.	When'd you see him last?
Hi, Daddy.	Well, what happened to you?
What?	Will you try to get some sleep?
So long, George. See you in the funny papers.	Goodbye, Sam.
Goodbye, everybody!	All in . . .
Oh, no  you don't feel so good.	I'm all right.
George! George!	Yes, sir.
Is it a charge, sir?	Yes  charge.
Hope you have a good trip, George. Uncle Billy and I are going to miss you.	I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.
Yes . . . Yes . . . You're right, son.	You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
I'm going to miss old Annie. Pop, I think I'll get dressed and go over to Harry's party.	Have a good time, son.
Got a match?	Very funny. Very funny.
Mary . . . Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.	Come on, George, let's hurry.
Oh, am I glad to see you.	Say, where's Mother?
Hello, George, how are you?	Harry . . . Harry . . .
What gives?	Nothing.
George, can I see you for a second?	Why, of course you can. Come on in the office here.
No, George, don't . . .	Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
Say hello to New York for me.	Yeah  yeah . . . sure I will.
Hello.	How do you do.
Well, what do you know  wife.	Well, how do you do. Congratulations. Congratulations. What am I doing?
Pop!	They're not my children.
Well, hello.	Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.
I'm not very good at this.	Neither am I.
Oh, no.	Come on, tell me.
My mother just called you? Well, how did she know?	Didn't you tell her?
Well, are you coming in or aren't you?	Well, I'll come in for a minute, but I didn't tell anybody I was coming over here.
All right, for a minute. I still can't understand it though. You know I didn't tell anybody I was coming here.	Would you rather leave?
Oh . . . yeah, yeah. That's all right.	Don't you like her?
George . . . George . . . George . . .	Mary . . .
After that, who cares?	That does it  come here.
Hi.	Hi.
Mary! Mary!	George, darling! Where have you been?
Oh, George, George, George.	Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!
I guess you forgot something.	Huh?
How about that one there?	Hmm? Well, I . . .
Come on, you guys.	Well, I don't know#.
For me#?	What the hell.  For you#.
My hair's getting wet!	So's mine.
I can't wait to get there.	But of course.
Sure you do -- you win either way.	I'm supposed to.
Who's that?  Quick -- I'm in love.	I hope that's the cousin.
Maybe by now they are.	They're moving pretty fast.
Why not?	I could give you a dozen good reasons.
Your dad must be really pissed.	We better go back in.
Over here.  I want you to meet somebody.	Lucky.  Lucky, lucky, lucky.
But the island!	The Shark.
You coming up on him?	You bet.  Hang on#.
Hey!	Over here!
On your own time?	Happy to do it.
Chief?	In here.
What about that camera?	What camera?
How long ago?	About an hour, maybe two.  Let's see -- I came on about eight#.
I can't let you take her out.	You can't stop me.
I'm going out there.	Hey -- you can't do that.
Where to?	No place special.  Just hanging out.
You stay here a minute.	Oh, c'mon.
Pop#.	You stay right here.  You're going in with me.
Michael.	Yeah?
I got something for you to do tomorrow.	I kind of had plans#.
Mike?  Is that you?	Pop.  I'm sorry.
I passed out, but I'm okay.	At least you're safe.  What about the others?
Dad, I'm sorry#.	Stay here.  Don't go anywhere. Just stay here.
Fantastic lady.  Don't know what I'd do without her.	Me neither.
Wait a minute#.	Too late, it's written.
Look at that:	First things first.
The shark that did this.  It was a shark, wasn't it?	We don't know that, do we?
Where the hell were you?	Late.
Do I have to talk to those two?	My boss and your boss.  Sure.
Let's get the kid home.	Home it is.
Need a ride?	As far as the office.
Hey!  That's my boss!	Better yet.
You have to smoke so early in the morning?	It's good with coffee.
Thank you.  I'll tell him.	For me?
All summer?	He wanted a job, he's got one.  I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.
I know what you're going to say.	Do you?
What?	What'd I say?
Hey -- it's not your job any more. I'm going to be late for work.	Just one minute#.
What're you doing?	Going out.
What is it?  What's the matter?	Mike's out there.
Mom, Michael won't talk to me.	Shouldn't he be at home?
Some people.	What's daddy doing?
Hang on!	Dad!  Dad!
They made me go with them.	Sure they did#.
Is that me?	That's you.
I told you, remember?	Oh, yeah.  So why aren't they doing it now?
We're going to die.	It's all right, we're okay.
My cousin will be here tomorrow.	Great.
You're not going out right away, are you?	Waiting for Andy.
Mike!  Are you going out?	Maybe.
Get a dance yet?	Nope.
Take a break for a minute, okay?	Huh?
Come on back up here!	Nope.
What about the others?	They'll be there when we get there. Might even have a fire started.
Right after, the Kids went out?	What Kids?  Who went out?
Hurry, please.	What the hell, they can't fire both of us -- someone's got to be in charge, right?  Which way are we going?
Be careful#.	Anything?
Rich or poor, it's nice to have money.	Figure they split?
How much longer?	Until we find something.
About damn time.	What the hell is it?
What is it?	Power line.
I don't care.	I love it.
Faster!  Faster!	Coming about#.
Heading back?	Might as well.
I don't think she's such hot stuff.	When are we going out?  You and me?
They're turning around.	Coming about, then.
I don't need you.  Andy's here.	You always go with Andy.
Do I have to play with the little kids?	Yeah.  Go on, beat it.
You're going out.	Yeah.
Look -- if you're going to get in the way, you can just go home.	I'm not in the way.  Andy, am I in the way?
Yeah.	Would you take him?
Oh, my God#.	What the hell is he doing?
Absolutely.  Good idea.	With those camera lights and#
Thank you.	Want another one?
Damn it.  I can't understand!  I gotta go, hon.	Don't forget you have your brother.
What do I do now?	Take a deep breath and hold it.
Honey# you all right?	No.
Damn it!	Hi, baby.
What's wrong?	Nothing.
Where are you going?	Up.
You all right?	I think so.  I'm not sure# Are you?
Michael#	It's all right, baby.  We're safe#
How the hell did it get in here?	God, they're horrible.  I hate them.  Did you see its eyes?  How black they are?  The look in them?
You're going down there again?	Yes.
Change your mind?	No.
I can use a shot of what he's got.	# Me, too.
Finally.	How's your patient?
They said you'd be here.	What's up?
That's right.	Who's going to do it?
Are you okay?	I'm  fine.
I will.	Well, then I'm going to film it.
I want that shark alive.	So do I, love.
How's sleeping beauty?	Still sleeping.
Could be a new dance#  Walking the Shark.	Thanks for helping.
Well, Doctor.  You've got your shark.	Thanks to you.
I think they'll come out now.	They still seem nervous.
He's a young one.	And big for his age.
When did this happen?	Ten minutes ago.
I knew it;  it's my fault.  We moved it too soon.	Don't blame yourself.
No one's ever done it before. It was a good try#	Not good enough.
Give me a ride?	Sure.
Hi, Mike.	How you doing, Kelly?
I haven't seen that much, but so far it looks great.	Well, wait till you see the rest.
Well, I needed a cold shower.	Come on!  Check this out!
This is where to be.  High and dry.	And alone.
You were great out there!	Did you see me?!  Wasn't I terrific?
Besides that.	I don't know, what else is there?
Isn't this fun!	Can hardly wait to do it again.
Told you you'd like it.	Now what's this do?
No#  It can't be.	What, hon?
Did you see that?	What?
I'll go with you.	No way.
Let us know as soon as you have anything.	Right, Mike.
Come on, let's go.	Something wrong?
Okay, you two, have a good life without me.  I gotta go.	Don't hurry back.
She still talking to you?	We're in love.
Come on, sweetheart#.	But you always let me#.
Daddy, why can't I#?	Did you hear what I said?  Come inside#.
I bought him his first legal drink. He got so pissed that night#.	He told me you both did#.
Where are you going?	Nowhere#.
What do I think?  I think it's a lovely idea#.	Please, Mom.  At least consider it. You should get away.  You shouldn't be alone now#.
I've always wanted to ride one of those#.	No way#.
It sure is good to be home#.	It sure is#.
No fair, I'm not armed.	Then don't come any closer.
Close the door.	They're at the beach#.
Where have you been#?	What's wrong?  What happened?
The doctor said she should be all right#She's in shock#.	But it went away#We would have known#.
You knew#?	It went away#.
Sweetheart#.	She could have been killed#You knew and you didn't tell us#You let your mother think#.
It'll grow on you.	I like it.  Really#.
You want to try your hand at something#?	I'd be afraid of losing#.
All he did was kiss me#.	It's beginning#.
Beginning of what?	Whatever happens next#..
Give it some time, Ellen#See what happens.	Part of me wanted to go off with him, the rest of me couldn't#I don't know why he wants me#.
We will#We'll have a lot of time together.  What are you going to do now?	We'll be there#.
What the hell's it doing in warm water anyway#?	What difference does it make?  It's here#.
I hope the man knows what he's doing#.	He knows what he has to do#.
Stop that#.	Stop what?
I see what you're doing#.	I'm hungry, Mom#.
The fish.  Check it#.	You check it#.
A big one#.	A small one#Your brother won't be here#.
Don't be late.	I won't#.
In a minute#.	What's going on?
Yes!	You can stay in my room.
Can I ride one sometime#?	It's too dangerous#.
Your father was six then.  Just like you#.	I'm still five#.
We have to dig it deep so the water will go all the way around#So we can swim to it#.	You're silly#.
You're coming, aren't you#?	Who's coming?
What's it cost to take a ride on that plane#?	The water's coming in#The water's coming in#.
I almost forgot#.	I didn't.
I'll be in to read you a story.	Good night, Daddy#.
It came for him.  It waited all this time and it came for him#.	Mother#.
I want you to get out of the water#.	What?
There's never been a great white where we live.  It's warm water# They don't like it#.	Your brother's dead#Your father's dead#.
All you all right?	I'm fine#.
How are you doing?	Okay.
I'll be all right, Michael.	Good.  So will I#.
I want you to give up your work#.	Mom, please don't start that again#.
You're having a good time#.	I am.
I'm not going to bother you anymore about your work#.	You're not a pain in the ass#.
It's not easy.  None of it is.  I have to find some way to get on with my life and I'm going to try.  I finally figured that out.  I'm going to do my best#.	Good.
It's late#.	Trying to write our report#.
You hungry?	No.
It got him#.	Why'd you come out here?
Promise me you'll be all right#.	Promise me#.
We will#We'll have a lot of time together, Michael#.	I'm going to finish what Jake and I started.  I owe him that.  Hell, I owe him everything#.  I'll get something important done for both of us#.
No#.	First time for everything is the best.  After that you know too much and it's never quite the same.
Depends on where you want to go#.	Doesn't matter#.
How can you just take the plane like this?	Boss' day off#Take the wheel#.
It's just like driving a car#.	Where do I pull off#?
How do you like flying?	It's wonderful#.
What's wrong?	Nothing#.
I'm fine.	No, you're not#.
I have two right feet.	Good.  I have two left#.
Our little island seems to agree with you#.	I have my own little island.
I could take some time off#.	You're always taking time off#.
I'll nick the boss' plane again#.	What?
I tried to tell you#I tried#.	Give me a hand here for Christ's sake#.
I can't#.	Yes you can#.
Want to go for a little ride?	I do#.
Hurry!	Just like that?
Can you keep a secret?  Something no one else knows?	Yes I can#.
What do you mean, it'll find her?	She said it was coming#.
Keep it steady#.	Aye, aye, Captain#.
What happened?	Nothing!  What the hell are you doing down there?
She has good days and bad#I don't know#.	She's a tough lady#.
How many#?	Will you leave me alone#?
Maybe I missed you too#.	Where the hell's the beer#?
Bad boy#.	I didn't do it on purpose#.
I wish you wouldn't say that#.	What?
Where is everybody?	Down here#.
What happened to Clarence and#?	Gave them the day off#.
You sure you've done this before?	Lots of times#.
What's so funny about that?	You think he's not good enough for her?  You're right.  If she was my mother, I'd send her home right now.
I'm coming#How close is it?	Close#I don't know#Just get the hell#.
You getting a reading on them?	I live to hear the sound#You all right?
You told me what?	Screw you, Jake#.
Holy Christ#.	Mom#.
What the hell are you doing?	I've got to get to her#.
All the time#.	It'll work#.
I'll do it, Jake.	No way#.
How much longer?  This is supposed to be your party.	In a few minutes#.
You have the safety talk at school, one o'clock tomorrow#.	Anything to do before I go home?
Did you like that, Mama?	Yes.
As I said, Sergeant, you nearly ran into me? What's the problem?	I'm afraid it's the "van" again.
What do you think?	I think you're here all day.
Yeah, he can go #	Think I'll lay down with him. Only way I'll get outta here.
You want my advice?	Maybe?
Maybe not? I'm feeling lucky ..	So am I. But where's my money?
What do you want it for?	To throw out of the window.
That isn't what you said before.	I was wrong.
Did he shut you down?	All but .. How you doing?
Did I say he did?	You looked like you did?
Well .. I didn't know that ..	No .. You didn't know that ..
I dunno what I can do to help you?	I dunno what I'd do with your help. I've gotta take her out of there ..
Where's your watch?	I guess by the bed.
What if we need a back up?	We're not here. I don't want the desk to hear us ..
Alright. I'll start at the top, and work down.	You ain't going in alone?
Did you find the knife, Sergeant?	No .. But we have a theory ..
Can I see your hands?	My hands?
D'you have a dog? Seeing Eye Dog?	No.
Have you been here long?	No, just a minute or two .. I knocked on your door - no one home, so I followed the music ..
Are you married?	Was. But I don't like to talk about it.
I know what you're like ..	How d'you know what I'm like?
Why can't I stay with you?	It's not possible right now.
Don't say that. Don't you dare say that .. I believe you  ..	I know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
You don't wanna sit here any more, sweetheart ..	I wanna be near you #
I think they're gonna arrest me.	I don't want them to arrest you.
A blind girl can just walk out of here, and you don't know who with?	You find something curious in that?
When did John divorce?	Two or three years ago.
You think John would like it?	I think John, would love it #
You can drive down there, Sir ..	I'm already walking. Where is it?
Don't ever stop fucking me!	Sooner# or later# I'll have to stop.
This can't be happening to me.	Jerry!  Do something --
Listen to me!	No.
Didn't hear it.	There is something missing here.
Oh Jerry.	You know I didn't ever want to hurt you.
Let me think about that.  Want something to drink?	I see what you're saying.
No no#	Oh, tell the story.
Well, thanks.	Well, take care.
Oh no.	No no. I knew.
So I know this is a bad time, but -- you will have a medical program, right?	Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know.
No, that's fine.  What calls came in today?	Wait.  That's yesterday, from the other office. Today is#
It's all going to work.  We're going to save the world.	Well, I'm happy for you.
Hey you.	Hi.
Too bad.	Better now than later.  We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.
Beer okay?	Yeah, thanks.
Drinks.  Food.  Plus, I called you a cab.	Good idea.  Thank you.
Truth?	Sure.
Well, good evening.	Good evening.
Yeah.  It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was so great, even before --  Jerry?	What?
Well -- this would be goodnight.	Good night.
Oh God.	Easy, easy --
Another time, okay Dorothy?	Fine, I just --
If I said that, would you stay?	No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't#
Why do you love me?	Why do you love me?
It's my fault.	What --
Why fucking not!  I deserve it.	Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
Wait. Where is he?	He's in the living room asleep.
That's the girl I love.	But you just gotta hear me out on one thing.  You're very responsible with Ray and you know it's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house.
First you gotta tell me something.	No--
Oh, thank you.	Told myself -- if he shows up, we'll stick with him.
I got it.	Now doesn't that just make you feel good to say it?  Say it with me.
Show.  Me.  The.  Money.	Congratulations.  You're still my agent.
You love me now, don't you?	Very much.
You are not allowed to act this way.	Why not?
Did you tell him about the "ten million for four years?"	Uh, not today, but --
You're telling me to dance.	No, I'm saying to be --
Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance.	Fine.
What's wrong.	Forget it.  Forget it.
I'll get you some quick work --	Good deal, man.
You never had The Talk, did you?	No.
Not everyone has what you have.	Then why'd you get married?  I'm asking you as a friend.
I don't want to be friends anymore.	Fine.
Thanks for coming.	I missed ya.  What can I say?
I have to ask.	What --
You gonna get that --	Not a chance.
I'm sorry what I said back there.	Don't be silly.
Pardon me?	Came here to fire you, Jerry.
# dick?	Dick.
Hi.	Hi Ray.
I don't see any.	Funny.
Show me the animal, Jerry!	Right up ahead, buddy --
Do you think it goes all the way across?	One way to find out.
Oh, my God.	What is it?
Sorry.	Nothing you haven't seen before.
You look good.	So do you.
It's not safe.	We have to help him.
I don't know. I don't have it with me.	When did you have it last?
Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?	I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!
My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing.	You couldn't have made that jump.
You see, that's just the thing. Paul and I have special permission to fly low.	How low?
You had the phone the whole time?	Where is it?
PAUL!	DAD!
Where's Dad?	Just hold on.
We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.	I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
Let me tell you a few things about you Dad, okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever very much.	He loves you too.
Absolutely not.	They're here.
ALAN!	KEEP GOING!
We need to keep moving.	Alan, I want to tell you that I'm so sorry about the#
I CAN GET HIM!	NO!
Hmm?	He's three. Why don't you wait till he's a little older?
He used to know me.	Sorry, Alan it's been six years.
So, Mark's working at the State Department now.	Really?  What do you do there?
You remember the sounds they made?	I try not to.
You're Alan Grant, aren't you?  I read both of your books.	Which one do you prefer?
Is that all it's been? I thought it was longer.	The important thing is we both made it. That's something we have in common.
We're safe!	No we're not.
We needed somebody who knew the lay of the land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.	I have never been on this island!
Well that's good.	But you never came across just one.
Billy!	It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.
You hear something?	No.  I feel something.
Oh --	-- my --
Hi, Dad.	Kelly!  What are you doing here?
How could you possibly?	Because you said so.  Maybe nobody else believed you, but I always did.
Are you all right?!  Anything broken?	I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?!
Dad!	Come on!
Had to.  To keep him still for the trip.	You've broken its leg!
What in Christ's name is going on?!	Isn't it obvious?
What is that?	Piss.
We took to the rock.	Why?
If I don't move, I can't shoot it.	Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.
What's he got in there?	Piss.
Their what?	Oh, God.
What?	Don't ask me.  The guy's completely out to lunch.
You know how to work a radio, don't you?	You're going too?
No way.	Oh, my God.
Then this is our chance.	Our chance to do what?
?!	It has a broken leg!
What do they want?!	What do you think they want?!
No.	No way.
Come on!	Where's Kelly?
We can't stay in here!	We're sure as hell not going back out there"
Head for the roof!	I have to find Kelly!
Something's wrong.	Look!  Sarah!
Oh, God.	What?!
Hold it down, Nick!	I'm trying!
We have to send someone to look for him!	You go if you like, but we're not waiting for you.  MOVE IT OUT!!
Ask her.	Can the kid walk?
How many lines of code are there?	Uh - - about two million.
No, no, no, that's crazy, you're out of your mind, he's absolutely out of his mind - -	Wait a minute.  What exactly does this mean?
How long will this take?	'Bout thirty seconds.
Alan?  Where are we going?  You see something?	Uh - - anybody else think we shouldn't be out here?
There you are.  Out you come.	Oh my God.
But you know, I should  really be the one going .	Why?
You know, if you really wanted to scare the kid you could've just pulled a gun on him.	Yeah, I know, you know#kids.  You want to have one of those?
Why would they care what we think?	What kind of park is it?
So what are you thinking?	We're out of a job.
Are you sure?	I'll just finish.  Yeah, I want to finish.
Dr. Grant!	Alan!
Do you see anything?	I don't know.
Alan?!	They're not here.
I'm going with you.	Okay.
No. We can't.	Why not?
It's all right.	Like hell it is!
That's right.  Will break through.	I get ah - -
Can we chance moving him?	Please - - chance it.
Faster, faster!	Must go faster, it's getting closer - must go faster!
Yes?	- - shut up.
I can't see.	What are we looking for?
Hey!  Where did you find those things?	In a box under my seat.
I read your book.	Oh, yeah - - great.
I threw up.	That's okay.  Listen, give me your hand.
Take a bite, take a bite.  I'm not letting go.	It's so strong!  Look at its nose.  Need help?
Go, go, go, jump!	You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
You got any kids?	Me?  Oh, hell yes.  Three.  I love 'em.  I love kids.  Anything at all can and does happen.
Where does he think he's going?	When you gotta go, you gotta go.
Oh my God!	We gotta do something.
Can't you stop these things?!	Sorry!  It's kind of a ride!
Ah - - they're here.	Who?
You four are going to have a little company out in the park.  Spend a little time with our target audience. Maybe they'll help you get the spirit of this place.	What does he mean by "target audience"?
He's knocked out!  He's knocked out!  Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!  Daddy, daddy!	Let's get you out.
It's safe?	It's safe.
Hear that?  Are you hearing this?	No, I didn't hear anything.  No, we're okay.
Let's go!	Okay.  Keep low.  Follow me.
Well?	There's no sign of him anywhere.
I don't know, I don't know.  I'm sorry - -	Why did you do this?
That's not funny.	That was great!
Okay# well# I think it's this way#	Great.
Hello?	Who is this? What's going on?
I don't know#	What about that other guy?
It's still on.	What?
That's right# it# it came right out of his chest#	Who's chest?
Now# I think the video store's open for another couple of hours. Let's go.	Video store?
So# why can't Jason get a fair trial?	Because everyone knows he's guilty#
Well?	He's fucking nuts.
I think I'm onto something, Joe.	Me too. I'm drunk.
See this?	Yeah, what is it?
What are you doing?	Checking out a theory. Just keep talking to him.
Where's he going?	I don't know# but I think he's pissed.
What happened? Where's Jason?	My client# is dead.  But I think he's a free man.
Where do you live?	Up there.
You look like brothers.	Yes -- we do.
Fine -- terrible.	What was the matter with it?
-- Ah, but what if it wasn't?	-- Small.
I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.	I don't know what you could have read.
-- You appreciate my writing.	Yes.
To do my work well, I have little time for --	You must make the time.  Where do you go off to in the lunch hour?
Hello again.	I've never seen you here before.
Are you free tonight?	Tonight?
He wasn't a lonely man, though.	What makes you think so?
Maybe it's true then what she said.	What did she say?
Do you?	We saw her naked once -- didn't we.
That's mad.	-- Oh, yes, it's mad.
It's not our fault.  We're naturally nervous.	And we're upset too.
Get the hell out of here.''!	Now Ann #
I'm sorry #	No!
Yeah! Life's looking pretty damn good at the moment.	I don't know what happened to you, Jack # but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.
Jack!	We're leaving.
Jesus Christ ! How could you do this to him? How could you do this?	Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving!
Listen buddy! Cut the crap! We're looking for Ann, not making a Goddamn movie!	Jack # You get to save the girl and I get my third act! It's gonna be good for you and good for me!
Did you fear for your life?	Yeah.
Are you gonna start it up?	Yeah.
Enjoy.  Well --	It's good to see you. Well -- could we do it first and then just talk?
-- May I? It's so --	Please --
-- I have to close up now. Leave your name and number with his message service, Mrs. Daniel, and why don't you just go home and wait until he --	No.
Oh no.	Like for you to look for the man.
I'm not going to hurt you, absolutely, I'm not.	Will you let me go then?
What? This?	-- OK?
Well do you think it was him?	What do you think?
I thought you were going back to the apartment.	You said you wanted these.
It's kind of late.	It got lonely upstairs. There's someone on the roof.
You asked if there was anything more you could help me with.	When?
What's the matter?	What the hell do you think's the matter.  I could wait for you someplace.
The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time.	Why?
Please.	We did this before.
Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.	Don't touch anything.
Oh look what he did in them.	Drop it.
Listen to me: It's all right. I've been expecting something.	My God, I thought it was over. And here I am, daddy, right back at the start.
How can you not think so? You know the things I can do.	They don't scare me any more.
Well --	Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.
John, how are you?	I'll be sending you on a report tonight.
Would you like to know what's in it? The report.	What's in it?
That's how the other one died, you know. In the water.	I looked it up.
Well?	Yeah.
Think this is our guy?	I don't know. It looks familiar to me.
Where is the child?	He's in his room, playing.
What do you like best about her?	Lunch in a restaurant.
Ladies and gentlemen#	Ladies and gentlemen#
Greatest.	Greatest#
On earth.	On earth.
Huh?#Oh God#What time is it?	The little hand is on the six and the big hand is on the nine. Where is mommy?
When is mommy coming back?	Soon.  Very soon.
When is mommy coming back?	Soon.  I told you before, very soon.
Uh, huh#	You got a letter from mom.
You're late.	I'm sorry, pal, but I had a meeting and--
Mom, I mean dad#	Uh huh#
Mom, I mean dad#	In a minute#
I think I'm going to throw up.	Oh, for God's sake#Here.
Daddy?	Yeah?
Daddy?	Uh huh?
Is mom ever coming back?	You mean for good?
I don't think so.	Oh#
Now go to sleep.  It's very late.	Good night.
Yes?	I love you#
Objection.	Sure.  Lots of times.
See.  That's my name.	It's my name too.
Wow!	You like it?
Is this really your desk?	Yep.
Did mommy ever see this?	No, she never did.
Mom--I mean, dad?	Uh, huh?
So do I.	Objection!
Were you?	Yes.
Look, it's not your fault, okay? It's me.  It's my fault--you just married the wrong person.	So we've got problems.  Everybody's got problems--that's normal--
Where are you going?	I don't know#
Hello, Ted.  You look well.	So do you.
How's the new job?	Fine.
I've seen him.	You have?
Okay, I'm here.  Now why did you--	Ted, do you love him?
Okay#I think I'll go talk to my son now.  How do I look?	Beautiful.
Wow!	I mean it Ted, you're running this one.
Yes.	Yes, what?
And?	I'm going to take it.
Jesus Christ.  Did you have to be so rough on her?	Do you want the kid or don't you?
Then how come she never said anything like that to me?	Maybe she didn't feel like she should have to.  Maybe she felt like if you'd been paying any real attention to her to start with, maybe you would've noticed.
She ever ask about me?	Uh, huh#Yeah#
You heard anything yet?	Any day.
Ted.	Uh, huh#
Mama, my story.	Again?
Not the way to talk to people.	Can I do anything I want?
Yes.	Time to study.
Oh, no. Where will he go?	Far, far away.
I will be back in a few days.	How many?
This many?	Yes, yes. Your brothers are here.
Who am I?	We do not know.
Will we be in this war?	No. This war is almost over.
I need to know what you know. I am no longer a child.	Ask whatever you will.
Good day.	Good day.
Do you think I must?	You decide.
What should I do about my doubt, Teacher?	It is a difficult situation.
Did you love your husband, before you married?	I did not know him before I married him. I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too. He is dead now.
No.	Too young?
You killed him.	Oh, yes.
I'll sue you.	Go ahead.
You're a beautiful woman.	Thank you.
Please.  I'll have sex with you, anything, but get out of the water.	He's not gonna hurt me.
Go!!!	I'm trying!!!
Jesus Christ!!	What the hell are you doing?!!
Maybe he doesn't play well with others.	Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
What's that?	It came from across the lake.
I can arrest you!!	Then do it!!
No!	I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
Where is he?!	I don't know!
And again.  How would you get him on land?	That's actually the easy part.
No.  Look.  He's got nothing left.	Yeah and every time we think there's no more danger--
If he's here, I'll find him.  Did she tell you we had sex together?	I never had sex with you!
Did you want to be killed by it?	You think I'm that nuts?
Didn't even sound good?	No.
I'm okay.	You're not okay, your leg's a mess.
You're gonna be okay.	Guess I finally got bit.
He's gonna live?	Yeah.  Thanks to you.
Why are you here?  Really.	I told you.
I'm not making it up.	Well.  You don't have to stay out here, why don't--
Oh my God.	What?
Same thing from Fish And Game.	Something's in that water.
He could be right there and you wouldn't see him.	I'd be able to see something.
That was an awful thing to say to me.	I'm sorry but you're#
Okay.  We're up at six.	Good.
You okay?  Kelly?	Yeah.  Nobody saw anything?
Are you okay?	Um# y'know#  Yeah.
Like little children.  You okay?	Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
Sorry.	It's okay.
You're having the best time of your life, aren't you?	What?  Why# people have been killed, I hardly think I'm having a good time, why would#  Does it show?
That's why you're here.  To get in the middle of something?	Maybe.  I've always read about what's happened.  I've never# I know it sounds silly but, it's nice to be someplace while something is actually# y'know# happening.
Well.  Goodnight.	We seem to say goodnight a lot.
Okay.  Okay.  Okay.	That is it!!
What?	Look.
Are we crazy?	Well#
Well#	You wanna ride in my truck?
You sure?  I don't mind#	No, I actually want to stay for a little while.
If I'm ever in New York#	Yeah.
I'm ready when you are.	Let's go.
You said nobody came in here!	Obviously I was wrong!
If you get a safe shot#	I'll take it!
He's done.  He's dying.	Don't count on it.  We better take him out.
Thanks for your help.	You too.
He just came up screaming.	Did he say anything?
I wouldn't.	I'm fine, thank you.
This# how long did this attack go on for?	Seconds.  Three, four.
What?	I thought I saw#
Hey!!	You threw it at me!!
You hurt his feelings.  I think you should go apologize.	Apologize?
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.	Look.
What is she doing now?  Mother of God.	What?
They're coming right in.	Such a simple idea and it's working.  What does that tell you?
Did you get him?	I don't know.  Back the truck--
Should I?	Wait.
Hi.  Listen.  Could I steal you a second?	Absolutely.
I had a great time last night. Again.	Me too.
That's not what you came to say.	You work for me.  I'm not comfortable with-- y'know, "us"#
You?	It started before you, Kelly, I never would've--
What'd I do?	Stay cool. Just remember to call him "God."
No. He won't come after me.	Why not?
Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?	I think so.
I heard a strange sound#	What was it?
What did you do?	Got dressed without turning on the light. I went downstairs# outside#
Where were you going?	I don't know. I had no food or water. It was very cold. I thought - if I can even save just one# but he got so heavy. So heavy#
Are you alright?	Can we rest soon?
They're going to hang you.  Why didn't you leave when you had the chance?	Because what I am interested in is right here#
Are we safe?	Maybe#
Will you go back to England?	I have nothing to go back for.
Will you consider that?	Yes. Yes, I will.
My God, Alice.	It can be dangerous#
Yes. Go ahead.	What the bloody hell plan is this?
Head for# for the white water.	Do you hear me, sir!  If you ever fall# into British hands#  What white water?
Where do we go from here?	We don't.
It should be enough to remind you France is the enemy.	Your enemy#
What did you say?	I said# France is your enemy. Not ours.
Sir!	The decision is final.
Sergeant Major!	Sir!
Men are to stay in file, Sergeant Major!	Yes sir!
You mind if I take a look at this?	Be my guest.
Be careful with it.	Don't worry, I don't want to give up any more.
Doc eat already?	The good doctor hasn't showed yet.
Bullshit#I was just talking to him.  I saw him move.	What?#
That's why there's a dead one on the ship.  It ran out of blood.	What dead one on the ship?
Jesus Christ#	Can you fix it?
I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?!	No.
Go on!	No!
You did good#	What?
That was a loud one wasn't it?	After a month of it you'd think I'd be used to it.
I guess I figured if I was in their shoes that's what I would've done.	Maybe you're more one of us than you think#sir.
We made it!	Where's Jones?
It hit me!  Where are they?!	I can't see them!
No!	It bit me!
I'm going inside.	What's your air reading?
#as long as you know it's not in your contract.	I know that.
Made your million, yet?	Not yet.
What the?#	Russian.
What happened?	It#almost got you.
At least we get time and a half.  That's in the contract.	Fuck double pay, man!  I want out of here!
Hey!#I feel something. It's moving!  He's alive!	I feel it, too#Someone's trying to get out.
How'd you do that?	What?  That?#I've done this one before.  You hungry?  I'm hungry.
Getting some food.	Under there?
What is it?	The air's stopped.
Don't spend all day down there.	Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't.
Are you sure you saw something?	How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
My pocket.  Check my pocket, will ya, honey?	Your pocket?
What's wrong, did you miss me?	Hardly.
I'll kill him!	Stop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?
How much did you part with?	Seven hundred for the pair.
I wanted to talk to you about that.	Well, talk.
Yes?	It's happening tomorrow morning. Get back here now.
Well?	Well what?
There are no others.	Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
Mind your language in front of my boy.	Jesus Christ!
What are you doing?	Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
How long has he been in there, son?	About twenty minutes.
It's not him, Dad.	Try that one.
Yeah?	That's no way to answer the phone.
So we have a bit of a problem, don't we?	Er well, yes we do.
There's nothing to worry about, it's going to be easy.	There is no such thing as easy in my experience and, if you think this is going to be easy, you're a dick. It may be easier than most but it's not going to be easy.
It must be this one.	Just give me the keys.
My neck, Dog.  That's the last bag?	How about you? All right?
Where?	Out the back.
And we will just have to find out who's going to be carrying them.	Carrying them. They could all be carrying them for what we know.
That's it all done, we are off.	You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
You what? What are you on about?	Listen, if he has the guns he might have the money . . . I think we should go and see him.
There's nothing in it!	What do you mean?
What the hell are you doing here?	Why, what's up?
Everything all right out there, Tom?	Right as rain.
Well, what did he say?	He said he thinks we have paid him, and he wants to talk about those guns . . . now.
You and me, Tom.	What do you mean, me?
Tom, this is our case.	. . . What?
You got it all?	A hundred grand.
I will.	You will what?
I'll see ya.	For half a million?
That you, boy?	It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
Go on.	I like your bar.
How much did you say it was, Tom?	You know how much it is, Nick.
You got a ticket already and, if you don't move it now, sir, we will move it for you.	I'll only be a minute.
Look. Go on, look.	At what, exactly?
What you telling us for? The only thing I care about is whether you get your rest in.	Tom, you're all heart.
What's left over?'	Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
You jerk--	I'm not talking to you. You don't have any friends.
I don't know what the big deal is.	You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam.
I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college--	I can't take any more school.
How do you think you're going to make a living?	I can fix cars.
It's my life. If I want to fuck it up, that's my business.	I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age.
Well?	You really want to know, sir?
How do you think I got to be a colonel?	Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. Do whatever they tell you.
Why don't you start with that?	Yes, sir.
Did you know he was going to be there last night?	If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
Private Johnson!	Sergeant?
Sam the Man.	Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.
Whole different story; isn't it?	You're fired. You're outta the department.
You weren't in here tonight, were you?	No sir.
Are we going to ever see your father?	My father.
This place is a gold mine.	Lead mine.
What?	It's a lead mine.
That where he was shot?	That's where he fell.
I gonna meet that family of yours?	Why would you want to do that?
Which is why we need to talk to you about the new jail--just so we're all on the same page.	We don't need a new jail.
Steve called for you.	Steve?
There must have been somebody.	I was too busy.
Not if you have half a brain in your head.	Of course you can.
Mom?	Yeah?
She finally got in--	It's Saturday.
Morning, Sheriff.	Hey, Pete. How's it going?
He's all yours.	Are you okay?
Your mother still doesn't like me.	I can't name anybody she does like these days.
We thought we were something, didn't we?	Yeah.
Wow.	Yeah.
How long have you lived here?	Two years.
You gonna tell your mother we been seeing each other?	She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.
You're out early.	Yeah.
Don't mind him, Sheriff. Boy's just a bit slow, is all. He don't mean nothin' by it--	That the problem, son?  You Slow?
Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.	What's up?
You going to tell her?	You going to tell him?
Right.	That's so cool.
You did.  Didn't you?	Why would I do that?
Who did this?	I told you --
Who did this?	All right.  It was#
I don't want him getting in the way.	He won't.
Anything?	Not yet.
Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!	It's him# it's him.
Like the look of these?  I made them myself, to set him free.	Why did you wait so long?
He's with us#	He's with us# He's with us#
So do you.  You've seen the future. Haven't you?	Yes.
He's good.	You haven't seen anything yet.
They were jealous of him.	Why?  Because he had you?
So why did you marry him?	That's my business. Harry.
Oh Christ.	Why don't you tell me the truth?
It's okay.	No it isn't.  You can't help me.
Nothing's going to happen to you.	Nothing?
What was that?	It's okay.
Oh God!	Hang on!
I've got to help him.	You can't.
No!  No!  No!	Harry#
# oh# God#	I'm here, Harry.
Don't look.	I# have# to.
Harry?	I'm okay.  I'm okay.
Is it finished?	I think so.
Where the fuck is he?	He got up and walked.
Are you finished with me?	For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
They weren't worth a damn.	I heard he was the best.
You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd maybe have a theory.	Oh, I've got plenty.
With what?	Evil.  He was evil.  Come on.
Whatever I said, I didn't mean it, okay?  I get a few drinks inside me --	We've never met.
Whose is the car?	Mine.
Any movie stars buried here?	Probably.
What the fuck are you doing here?	Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.
I can't let you in.	Yeah, I know.
Leave her alone --	Shut up!
Him too.	We've got to get you to a hospital.
My God.	What?
Hold on.	I'm not afraid to die.  There's something terrible# coming home#
Where'd you learn that?	What?
They got here before us.	Looks that way.
# no#	He's better off this way.
That's where we're all going.	In my time, and nobody else's.
This is where we killed him.	You didn't try hard enough.
He did something with the ground.	Yes?
Have we met before?	No.
Why's that?	He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything.  He made us think it was over and done with.
He's not!  He's not!	Who's not?
You could still help me do that.	Why would I want to?
You know I'll kill you when we're done.  I have to.	Yes.
Wait# you still feel something for that bitch?	No!
Hello?	Bob, it's me.
Hi again, how's it going?	Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?
Oh, hi.	Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this?	No.
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob Charlie Brown.	Hi, Charlie.
I could cut the ones that are left for you.	Ok.
I don't want to go home.	I know. I don't either.
Of course.	Do you want to have some breakfast?
Yeah, I'm going to take a shower and I'll meet you downstairs.	OK, see you downstairs.
I'm stuck. Does it get easier.	No, yes, it does#
You made it.	They really have to work on that street name thing.
It's for my daughter.	How old is she?
Nice one.	Fuck off.
It's bad isn't it?	We should get you to the doctor.
Where's your husband?	Working.
Oh, I guess you're busy, huh.	I don't want to be.
What do you want to drink?	A coke.
So, where'd you go today.	Around.
I'm sorry.	That lunch was the worst, huh.
When are you leaving?	Tomorrow.
I don't want to go back tomorrow.	I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.
You're leaving right now?	Yes.
Why are you crying?	I'll miss you.
Yeah, its really different here.	Well, that's good, I have to get the kids off for school.  Can I call you in a little while?
Hello?	Bob?
Hello?	Hello, Bob, it's me.
I guess she's busy.	That's ok.
How'd it go today?	Good#I'm tired.
I don't know what to do.	That's ok, you'll figure it out.
You smell weird.	What?
Hair stuff?	I gotta go to work.
See you later.	Bye.
Yeah.	Yeah, I think you're probably right# because when you try to#
Do you think it's done?	I don't know.
Will you please stop smoking?	But I like to# and I don't smoke that much.
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Character and calling? Is this yours?	Oh# that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
Are you sure you want to stay?	Are you sure you have to go?
Yeah, I know you have to work the whole time, I'll probably have more fun here. I'll call Charlie and those guys.	Ok, definitely call them, I'll be back Friday. I love you.
I miss you.	It'll just be a few days.
John! What are you doing here?	I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
I missed you.	Do you think they have a room here?
What?  That's horrible!	What happened?
You're glad somebody tried to kill me?	No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out#
What're these?	I don't know.  What are they?
What a#jerk!	Peter, are you okay?
#you wearing a watch, Father?	Yes.  It's exactly#
George, come in.  What the hell happened to you?	It's nothing.
When your secretary called, she made no mention of her coming, too.	My secretary?
Is he going to be okay?	I hope so.
How're you doing?  Looking lovely as always.	You ready?
What is it?	Something he said, just before#
-- you wouldn't last five minutes.	Just open the door, please.
So#we won?	Yes.  We won, that's right.
So#what did you think of the tape.	I think you gave me the wrong one.
So what'd I miss?	You're right.  I must've made a mistake.
We need to talk.	Peter, please#
We needed to know all we could.	I'm going to look around.
Nothing yet.	I'll go outside and take a look in the garage.
Get up!!	What's the#OH SHIT!
Peter, let go of the chair!	What?
You okay?	When's your birthday?
Plenty of time.	What are these?
He was trying to tell me something.	And his message was  "Together, no matter what?"
How much time do we have?	Not a lot.
Hello?	I know who he is.
You know what?  You can go.	Suit yourself.  But does this mean anything to you?
Would you sign it for me?	Of course.
What's the matter with you?	He's looking right at me.
He could see me.	I'll quit, maybe you should start.
Thanks again for everything.	Hey, don't thank me.  Somebody up there likes you.
What's up?	How're you doin' today?
I hate it.	Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?
Taste this.	I can't eat before a game.
What?	Nothing.  So good luck.
Hi.	Need any help?
So that's why we can't get along? Because I'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump shot?	You're the one always turning your nose up at me.
She needs to stop running around like a little boy.	She's alright.
Which one for tomorrow?	The blue.
Okay.	Thanks, sweetheart.
So that means it's alright for you to act like that?	What'd you do?
You might want to put a jacket on him, it's getting cold.	He's fine.
Well, thanks again.  This was really nice of you.	It was the least we could do.  And I love to cook.
You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house.	Really?  Well, come on, then.
I can take it.	This time get your feet set.
You could've given up after you threw that ball away.  But you kept your head and you showed real heart.	Thanks.
Can I take your coat?	You're cold?
No, I mean I can check it for you.	Oh, sorry.

I think we gotta kiss now.	For how long?
I don't have to do what you say.	Man, forget you then, stupid.
That's it, give it your best shot.	Would you watch the damn road?
See you made it.	Yeah.
Hey.	Hey.
Early night for you, isn't it?	I was about to ask you the same thing, going out with a college boy and all.
Why?	Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything.
Four.	What?
When'd you get this?	It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just#?

What?	I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.
When did you decide all this?	Few days ago.
So#I guess I'll see you around.	Uh huh.
Just something I'm trying.	No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
Shouldn't you be lying down, or#	I'm alright.  But you can sit.
Tried calling you a couple times.	Oh yeah?

It just isn't.	Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
It doesn't matter, alright.  Just leave it alone.	Find.
What's going on?	We need to talk.
You asked me what was missing.	What?
I heard enough.	What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away.
I'll play you.	What?
You're out of your mind.	So you're gonna bitch up?
What will this prove?	You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
Hey, girl.	Hey.
Give it yourself.	I don't wanna look fast.  Thanks, girl.
Fine, then how many nights home is that?	Keep your voice down.
Not great.	What's that, not great?

From your mouth.	I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.
What do you want?	Came by to check on you.
You okay?  huh?  Jimmy?	And the book says: "We may by through with the past, but the past ain't through with us."
Why don't they have the same last name? They don't have the same last name.	I know -- and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --
What do you want? Why are you here?	I'd like to talk to you.  Your boyfriend let me in, I just knocked on the door --
What the fuck do you want?	I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.

I have never seen a sight more beautiful than you, tonight.	We have much to discuss.  Tomorrow.
There were two.  Not one.  But two.	I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
Mother -- ?	May I speak with you?  Alone?
What is it, mother?	I wish to discuss your brother.
It -- it doesn't matter, Mother!  He is dead now!  Dead!	Yes.  Dead.  Two nights ago.  The night of my dream.
What had you to do with this, Mother?	He is your brother!
Your Majesty#	How goes that favor I asked of you?

Where are you going?!	Paris.  There is still much to do. We'll be back soon.  Be ready.
No!  Stop --	I will need you all.  All for one. One for all.
Once you are through, don't stop until you reach the river.	They will know you helped us, if we go this way.
Coming?	What use am I?
What do we do now?	I don't know about you, but I plan to wait here.
It worked!	It's a prison, you idiot!  They don't expect anyone to try getting in!  The problem will come when we want out!
Do I look all right?	None of the ladies will be able to take their eyes off you.
Mother's ring.  I can't take this.	She died giving you to me.  And I want to die knowing it is one the finger of the women my son loves.
It's been too long.	Life is too long.  Except when we have our friends.  Look at you! You're still a boy!  Sit, sit!  I'll open a bottle of wine.
Thanks, but not for me.	You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came.	I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
Where are you going?	To kill the king.
You look so sad.  Is it something I have done?	It is something I have done -- or did not do.
Are you hungry?	Just# water.
I just left the garden, it was empty.  What did you see?	It# was nothing.  A nightmare, nothing more.  Go away, I --
Your Majesty#?	# tired.  Must# lie down.
What number did you tear out?	Eh?
The food doesn't please you?	It's lovely.  It's just#
You mind if I ride with you?	Yeah, stick around, you might learn something.

Did you hit him?	I didn't hit shit!
Find out for me.	Fine#
Let's roll -	Right behind you.
I'll take the south end -	Fine -
What?	When did you join the force?  You know, the police force, the place you work#
Alright, where is she?	And who are you?
So#  to get the car back, you break into her house.	I didn't break in - the back door was open!
Are you alright?	I'll live#
I was just having a little fun -	And what did he do to the girl?
Captain there's someone here to see you - he's waiting in your office.	Who is it?
Captain?	Yeah?
So where are you from?	Up north.
Mind if I turn out the light?	No#
You always carry a gun with you?	No.
What's going on here?	You'll find out - soon enough.
Why did you set me up?	I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone.
I had it all on tape#	What did you do then?
No#	Look, Jimmy, you know, I haven't seen you in eight years, you show up to my door like you're on drugs - now the least you could do is tell me what the fuck is going on!
And?#	I killed them.
Oh man#what happened?	I don't know.  But I'm in trouble. I'm all over the papers. I have to figure out what's going on.
I've got a better idea#	OK#where do you want to start?
You know this time, there's nobody that's gonna cover your ass. You're over your head this time.	What else is new?
That was her - the girl# We have to go.	I'm not going anywhere!
I can't help you anymore, Jimmy. I'm sorry.	I'm going to need a way to get there.
Where are you going?	Well I've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what I mean?
Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book.	Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is#unusual.
What would your - boyfriend - think?	Screw him!
You don't seem afraid of much.	Not with this#
Where am I going?	County jail - get in.
Don't you guys ever knock?	Where is he?
Long gone, huh?	I asked him not to tell me where he was going.  I told him I don't want any part of it.
How long do I have?	Twenty minutes max.
Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?	I have to.
If you can't look anymore, I understand#	As long as they're dead#
Is it weird?	The mark? Yes.
Who did he ask for?	You.
Will?	You wanna watch this or what?!
It's getting late and#	Don't talk to me!!

It's the truth, I swear.	All right, forget it.  Tony, you got anything we can put on his face?
I don't think I should go home looking like this.  You think I could stay at your place tonight? Your mother's not there is she?	No, she isn't.
You'd better make a move kid.  He thinks you're trying to screw him.	Wouldn't bother me.
Hey#you got nothing here.	I could have told you that.

Let's get out of here.	Did you see them run!
I don't get involved with anything, you understand that?  Nothing!  I'm clean as far as you know#right?	Yeah, take it easy.  Will you relax.
Johnny, I swear to God, if you open your mouth about any of this#	Me?  I wouldn't say a word to my aunt and uncle#or even your uncle, Charlie#
Take it.  I'm doing it for you, stupid!	No you're not#
Don't you move!!!	I'll be here.  Don't worry.

Uncle, how are you feeling?	Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?
Take a drink!	Ok.
Hey, where you been?	Oh#around#why?
Oh yes, he's pretty good.	What I don't understand is why you have to go to college to read these books that you're gonna read anyway.
Wasn't a book#was a short story.	What was it?
Why don't you take a look around the place if you want?	Oh, that's ok#I've been in and out of this place fifty times.
I'd like to eat something before I go back to work.	Ok, we'll go for lunch.
Well#with the hotel that's ten# fifteen#	Here.
Please take it.	Well#
Sure#it's not that#I mean#	It's all right.
Alright# Hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night?	Did you?
C'mon Charlie#one more day.  I'll call in sick for work.	No#we can come back in a couple of weeks.  Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.
You know why#with my parents.	Well you can't blame them in a way.
The building on the corner.  That one!  He's been on the roof a half hour now!	Now don't get excited.  Don't get excited!!
What's the matter with this kid?	I feel fine--nothing wrong with me.
Don't count it#it's all there.	Count it.
Ah#there's a funny lookin' cab behind us.	I know#I know.
How about me?  I don't get a drink John?	Of course!  A double for Michael, Tony.
Just keep him quiet.	Friends of yours Michael.
Yeah.	Ok guys#have a heart.  This is my business.
-- But he does seem very nice.	You think so?
Look who's talking.	Yeah, speak for yourself.
Dinner?  Again?	Haven't you had enough of us, Dad?
Did he?  That's more than we get to do.	Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along.
Daddy.  Does your friend have a name?	A name?
Now, I'm getting interested.  I want to know more ---	We've got some things to discuss.
What is this?	Annie made them.
I haven't been the father to you that --	That you've been to Susan?
You know, darling, this is going to be a wonderful party.	Yes, it is.
Honey, please.	Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York!
Yeah, but --	But what?
Yes, sir?	Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet you.
What are you eating.	You mean this, sir?
Hello, Beautiful.	Hi.
Well# goodnight.	Yeah.  Goodnight.
Oh, you're the great Joe's attorney now?  Are we going to go to court? Or are we going to go to bed?  And I don't mean you and me.  I mean you and him.	That's it.  It's over.  Get out.
Nice to see you.  I didn't expect you, but certainly you can't get enough of a good thing.	Thank you.
Anything else, Mr. Black?  How about some water?	Why yes, thank you.
Perhaps you could remind me.	I'll make a note of it.  Anything else?
I'm all excited --	Me, too.
Yeah, something he goes by --	Oh, excuse me.  This is -- uh -- this is --
Sorry#um - you - you know it's gone right out of my head --	What?!
Have we met?	Uh -- he's from out of town --
No --	I get the feeling you've done some business before.
What do you think the Board is going to say when I tell them that?	I don't care.
Whose?	Yours.
Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, Bill?	I don't think so.  Do you?
And what do I get?	You get not to go to jail.
Well, I guess he's found one.	Joe, you do get around.
Not time yet.	Make it time.
Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?	Yes.
-- And call my family, I'd like them to come over for dinner tonight.	Didn't the family get together last night --?
How long you here, Joe?	As long as it takes.
Black.	Hey, this is fun.
Don't bother asking, we already tried.	It's so very nice to see you again.
What are you doing here?	I'm lost.
Susan?	Yes?
Goodnight, Joe.	Goodnight to you, Susan.
She's in a great deal of pain.	Yes.
I have to go, I'm sorry to say --	Be sorry for nothing.
Why?	Because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married.
No, I'm not.	Girlfriend?
Where are you going?	To bed.
You first.	Why don't you get off his case?
Almost.	I said get out.
I love your smell.	-- I guess you haven't.
Thank you.	It was everything.
Yes?	I don't know who you are.
You're here?	I am.
Did you like making love to me?	I loved it.
Where are you going?	Nowhere?  I'm#here.
Yes.  Your father and I, our time together has come to an end.	Where are you going?
Well -- I --	And you can't tell me who you are.
I can tell you the when part.  Tonight.	It gets worse.
We know so little about each other --	We know all that we need to know --
Did I say that?	And I said you'd have a hard time finding a woman like that.
I - uh --	You want me to wait for you, you'll be back --
I'm still here.	But you're not.  You're somewhere else.  You're someone else --
Tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now --	I love you now, I'll love you always --
Susan --	-- Yes?
Joe, that's the kitchen.	Thank you.
What a good idea.	Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?
Well, thank you for letting me know.	Not at all.
Good morning.	Good morning, Bill.
And what?	And I won't tell anyone who you are.
Bill --	Yes?
Joe --?	Yes, Bill.
-- I don't deserve this.  I'm still young, this is not my time --	That's what everybody says.
I want to live.	I understand.
What's it like?	What do you mean?
Perhaps you would like to wait in my office --?	No.
Would you like to sit down, Joe?	Yes.
#I'd like to be alone for a while.	Are you sad, Bill?
Now I'd like to be alone.	Oh.  Okay.
Are you going to eat your lunch	It's all yours.
And more.	Why didn't you stop me?
Dinner?  Absolutely.	Absolutely.
Why did you go to the hospital?	I don't know.
Okay.  Goodnight.	Goodnight.
I'm sorry, Bill --	That's okay.
I'm not hungry.	Then I can't help you.
I couldn't sleep.	I'm sorry to hear that.
Yes, I saw you see me.	Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.
Uh --	Yes?
You are?	Yeah.
Thanks.	Not at all.
What the hell do you care?	I was just asking, Bill.
-- And I'm in love with your daughter.	Say again?
You're what?	I think you heard me, Bill.
I don't like what you're saying.	I don't expect you to.
Okay.	Get him in here.
Happy Birthday, Bill.	Thank you.
Not exactly.	I guess you have your reasons.
Yes.	That's life.  What can I tell you?
You are --?	'#Yes --'
Yes.	Death!
Excuse me?  Could I say something?	Of course.
'#I know, it's none of my business.'	What?
I think you know --	I don't!
What are you talking about?	What you were talking about.
Are you giving me orders?	I'm sorry, I --
Where are you?  Are you there?	It's enough now.
Where are you?	I'm here.
About what?	I want to have a look around before I take you.
No, anything is possible.  It's up to Joe.	Joe, you don't know how glad I am you're aboard.  Anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man, I'm in his corner.
But he does give a shit.  Don't you, Bill?	Yeah, I give a shit.
Come in, Joe -- I want to thank you -- okay, Bill?	Sure.
Joe knew the whole story.  I told him.  It was his idea that I come clean.  I mean I wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what I mean?	Yes, I believe I do.
Why don't we let it rest for the moment?  Give it some air?	Well said, Eddie.  Mr. Black, shall we?
Eddie?	Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?
Good morning, Dad.	Hi, honey.
Will you relax?  I know it is a big deal day --	How did you know?
I thought you were in a meeting--?	I am.  With you.
#There's a start for a meeting.	I know it's none of my business --
Thank God.	He doesn't care.  But thanks anyway.
Daddy, what's the matter?	Nothing.  I'm sorry.
What is it, Daddy --?	Nothing.
You know each other?	We've met.
It'll come back, Daddy.	Will it?#
That was wonderful.	Yeah, it's good to get together.
Where's Joe?	Joe?
Where is he?	I don't know.
Susan, I don't think Joe is going to be with us long.	Where's he going?
I love him.	I don't care if you love him!  I'm telling you he's no good for you!
You were right about Joe, he is going somewhere --	I'm sorry.
But what?	I want you to know how much I love you.  That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.
I love you, Daddy --	That's why it's okay.
I'm still here.  Would you like to dance with me, Susan?	Oh, yes --
So if I needed a doctor, you could be it?	I could be her.
Not at all.	How 'bout another cup of coffee?
I've got to go --	Did I say something wrong?
You said you liked me.	No --
#We know so little about each other.	But we've got time.
Well, what then?	It's simple, you just go to the bathroom.
Should I wear it?	No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.
You don't know?	I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.
My wife.	What's it like?
How long have I been here?	Couple days.
What makes you think he's my friend?	Seen you together, that's all.
Shit. Wrong room.	What?
I know you said you didn't want any calls#	That's right I did, didn't I?
What?	Who did this to you?
I like your car.	Thanks.
Jimmy?	What the fuck are you doing here?
Why?	I don't want blood on them.
Yeah.	So you have information for me?
Sleep okay?	Yeah. You?
Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.	Who is he? What have you got me into?
How do I know he did that to you?	I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
It's not easy to be calm when -	Just relax.
His name was Jimmy.	What happened?
What do the police think?	They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
Me? Why would he be interested in me?	I told him about your car.
What's wrong?	Somebody's come. Already.
Neither do I.	Don't protect him.
Calm down.	That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
They're not looking for him.	Why not?
You can stay here for a couple of days if it'll help.	Thank you.
On the house.	Thanks.
My wife.	Sweet.
Beer, please.	What do you want?
There's a dress code?	What are you here for?
You're the memory guy?	How do you know about me?
I don't know. I'm sorry.	You have no idea where you've just come from? What you've just done?
How can you read that again?	It's good.
What the hell you want to go there for?	You know it?
Why?	Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.
You don't know him?	No! Should I?
I don't think so.	Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what -	No. No, just let me think for a minute.
We've got to get him out of here.	He's got to have a car, right? We just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him.
It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.	Fucking hope not.
She's gonna use you. To protect herself.	From who?
She has no idea who I am.	Why are you following me?
Happy now?	I won't be happy until you leave town.
What's wrong?	There's a guy in here, hurt bad! We gotta get him to a doctor!
It is now.	You can't just take it!
Yeah.	What's your twenty?
I don't know.	Yes you do#
I thought we had to meet the Man.	You do.
We want it back.	Okay.
How fast does that go?	It goes very fast.
Tell me everything.	No.
Would you find me#?	Of course.
No part of it wasn't real.	I know.  And now?
Yeah.	And what do I do with him?
Anything?	Nothing.
What do we got?	Five minutes#
They watching us watching them watching us waiting for them?  Or what?	Who knows#
How much we looking for?	Nothing.
Where the hell are you, man?	On my way back#
What is going on#?!	As in#?
What's your take?	What's the point?  It's going down.
How?	We don't know.
This I gotta see#  #the "make up an excuse and stop" part.	Have faith.
Yeah#?	Sonny#?
You okay?	Yeah.
Okay#see you soon.	#and thanks for the flowers.
You mean with the flowers#?	What's it say?
Okay.	Good idea.  We'll grab a bite.
What do you care?	Do we need this#?
Then what were we talking to you for?	I had to lay eyes on you.
What do I care what you think about how he looks?  You wanna fuck my partner or do business?	Wait by the phone.  You get a call.  Or maybe you don't.  Until then, piss off back to where you come from#
This the load you lost a while back?	It is.  He try to take tonight's load?
They said they wouldn't hurt them, wouldn't hurt them if#	They lied.
I can tell, can't you?	Yeah, oh yeah.
That is one hell of a shirt. I bet you paid a pretty price for it, am I right?	Oh, it ain't cheap. I mean, yeah, I'd say this was an all right shirt. Don't like to, uh, you know, have a lot of cheap stuff on my back.
Let's see how you look. Fine. You look fine. Now I'm gonna have to have that other ten#	Ten, ten -- I got a twenty -- take that#
What for?	So you could sleep! I mean Christ!
What d'you want?	What?
You really want to do business?	Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you two are a couple -- ?
He fell. Hey, fella, you fell. Is he all right?	Is he all right!
Yeah.	History, man, history. How much?
It's there!	What?
Hey, you know what's gonna get us out of here?  It's not a map, Max. It's our balls. You know what I mean#  #I gotta get laid man, I don't know 'bout you guys, but if I don't get it on soon, I'm# I'm not gonna make it.	Shit.
DAD!	Oh Jesus! 
You know where they are?	Sure.
Girlfriend?	#She was on the plane.
She didn't know anything about#I wouldn't have wanted her to.	Lucky girl.
How's it feel?	About as good as it looks.
What they give you?	Twelve years.
Hello, Billy.	Hello.
I want you to know we're going to do everything, in our power to get you out as soon as possible. Believe me.	Thank you.
What's wrong?	Sit down a moment, Billy.  I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.
No# It looks like your going to have a new court.	What do you mean?
What do you mean LIFE FOR FOR WHAT! FOR WHAT!	Billy!  Please!
Best way is get your ass out# any# way# you can#	What do you mean?
You got your stuff?	Yeah.
Okay?	Yeah!
What time is it?	Two thirty.
What?	Cut his fucking throat.
Max, sit down. You're in no shape to kill anybody.	I want to cut his throat.
Never was anybody like you#	You can't take anything seriously.
Susan - forget it. Go get us a seat on the plane. Now.	What is it? . . . Billy?
His name?	Who?
Hey, you can't#	What's your name?
Peter#	Yeah#?
Excuse me, I'm talking to you.	No, you talkin' at me.
Oh, that's gonna work.	You got a better way up?
I only got#	Just do it!
A mistake.	"Mistake"?  What's that supposed to#?
The kid#	The kid's with them!!
My God, what the hell are you#?	Hurry, the woman needs help!
You better tell me what the hell's going on here!	Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!
It would take a minute or so.  You won't last that long out there.	Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!
He didn't do it!	What?
A shame.  You looked great tonight.	Please.
Who know?  We get lucky, maybe a couple of 'em'll be ours.	We're down to a "couple" now, huh?
Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop#	Maybe they lied to you.
Honey, just leave it.	No, there's#
He was just doing his job.	Fine, then I'm the bad guy. Jesus!
#you don't even know what you're looking for.	You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss#
Don't.	Listen to me:  we're getting you out.
Oh, come on, come on!	Jump in.
C'mon#	Ah#
No#	We can do it!
It bit you.	No shit.
My God.	What?
Must get lonely, living out here all by yourself.	I always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else.
Here.	What are they#?
But what?	Nothing.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.	It's fine.
Thank you so much.	My pleasure.
For a while I thought I might go crazy.	I know how that can be.
You want me to burn my book?	Yes.
Then light the match, Paul.	No big deal.
See, isn't this nice?	Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
Here, in case you think of any ideas.	Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much.
What's the matter, Paul? You haven't written a word.	I can't write this anymore.
I hope you like it.	It looks wonderful. And so do you.
Paul, I know you've been out.	What?
Yes, Paul.	I'm almost done.
Stop--stop right here.	What? What is it?
No, no, of course not. It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him, and when he's got a book coming out, he usually keeps in touch. So when there was no word from him#	You think he might be missing?
I thought you were over it.	I am. Well, maybe not completely--
Not everything.  Why do you think she's really here?	From her point of view or mine?
You won.	I suppose I did.
To win?	What else?
We're due to take off.	Not for seven more minutes.
Do you know me?	No.  Should I?
Look, it's either you or the rent and I don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice.	What if I pay the rent?
What are you doing here?	Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
Would you mind if I'm on top?	Oh, either way works for me.
I wouldn't do that.	Do what?
Ask a question, you get an answer!..	Damn, you're beautiful.
Before you are.	How can you possibly?  I've got to get right on the plane.  I'm leaving now.
How's it going?  Everything okay?	Just like old times.
I want you out of there.	Why?  What's happened. What did you see?
Are you okay?	I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here.
No.  Should I?	No.  You just looked as if you did.
Sorry I didn't let you know where I was.	Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
An idea, yeah.	Like?
If he didn't want to go anywhere without me, how did you get him on the flight?	You were there.
I don't think I can get her to do it.	You mean it'll be difficult.
Something else?	Aren't you even curious?  About why she did it?
So what did he say?	Good job.  And thanks.
A visit from an old friend.	What's happening here?  You're dead!
C'mon, c'mon, tell the truth#c'mon.	They'll kill me.
You asked for my help.  You asked for my help#come on#	You're right, of course.
Is he serious?	Always.
Did we get it?	We got it.  On your feet.
You were in the car!	I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio.  He said someone was#
They're dead.  Jim's dead.	Take off your coat.
The message is for Job.	I'm going to answer it.
May I come in?	Sure#
What are you going to do?	He's expecting my call.  I'm going to the station#  And I'm going to call him.
Reach your folks?  How they feeling?	About what?
Who are you and what are you doing here?	I need one hundred thousand dollars.
I'm going to have to front you personally.  Don't lose that money without losing your life.	I wouldn't dream of it.
Wait!  Hold it - it's on. Let's go.	Let's move!
Zero body count.	We'll see.
That's not it.  That's not the list.	What's the matter, you don't know this trick?
Jack.  Jack.	I didn't touch it.
You're going to use Walter?	He's our guy.
Such a nice ass.	And a lonely ass.
Oh, you're not going. You're staying.	No, I'm going.
I don't wanna talk about it.	Well, what do you wanna talk about!
Where you been?	I don't know, Rose. I don't know where I've been, and I don't know where I'm going.  You should have your eyes opened for you, my friend.
Have I been a good wife?	Yes.
Where's Ma?	Bed.
You haven't once said you like my dress.	I like your dress.  It's very bright.
Why you looking around so much?	I don't know. I got a feeling.
I won't have to shoot those dogs. They will kill each other.	You think so, huh, Stupid? Those dogs love each other.
Yes!	Hurry up, hurry up. We open in five minutes.
Have you come from my brother?	Yes.
Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat!	Maybe I should come back another time.
Why?	Why what?
She was right to leave me.	You think so?
Son of a bitch!	Where are you taking me?
I can't believe what is happening.	Me neither.
What?	That light.
It's so bright.	I've never seen a moon like that.
Oh my God.	What?
What? What have we done?	Take it easy.
Hi.	Hi.
Thank you!	For what?
So. Where are we sitting?	Come on.
That was just so# awful!	Awful?
No thanks.	I think that's it.
What do you want to do now?	I wanna go home.
It's really cold.	Yeah. It smells like snow.
What's the matter?	How can you ask me that?
This is your place.	That's right.
You've gotta get outta here.	No. I'm gonna wait.
No, I'll tell him.	No, I'll tell him.  What am I going to tell him?
I got things to do.	Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff.
Is there anything you want to tell us, honey?	You? No.
You don't want the fish.	No?
A man who can't control his woman is funny.	She was too young for him.
Have Something.	I shouldn't.
What about the wedding?	My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married.
I'll call you when I get to Mama's house.	You've made me very happy, Johnny.
Johnny, I have something to tell you.	I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone.
And you're a big liar! I've got your ring here!	I must ask for that back.
In time, you will see that this is the best thing.	In time, you will drop dead, and I will come to your funeral in a red dress.
What?	Where's the ring?
No.	Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him?
Will you live here?	No.
So we'll sell the house.	I got married before, you didn't sell.
How's the mother?	She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
Hi.	Where you been?
What the hell happened to you?	Well. I don't really know where to start.
Hi.	Hey there  #YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES#
What about the moon?	Did you see it?
Moving in?	I came right from the airport.
So.	Where is she?
That's it! That's the reason!	I don't know.
Can I get another one of these?	Definitely!
May I walk with you a ways?	Sure.
You knew that man?	Yes.
That's my house.	You mean the whole house?
You got me.	You see that moon last night?
She's got it.	I knew she had it.
How do you know she is a witch?	She looks like one. Yes, she does.
A witch,  a witch,  burn her!	Did you dress her up like this?
Burn her anyway.	Quiet! Quiet!  There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.
Order, eh -- who does he think he is?	I am your king!
The same!	Who are they?
We shall do no such thing # let us pass!	Oh, please!
None shall pass.	What?
I'll do you for that.	You'll what # ?
What with?	Just keep me covered.
There!  Look!	What does it say?
Who are they?	Oh, just some friends!
Look, you're a busy man #	Yes, I can help you with your guest.
Too late.	What?
Where?	There.
Oh, shut up.	It's always the same # if I've said it once.
Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.	Who did we lose?
Old woman!	Man!
Well?	# Well, we did do the nose.
Bring out your dead!	Here's one!
Don't be such a baby.	I can't take him.
I can't.	Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes.  He won't be long.
Who's that then?	I dunno, Must be a king.
You killed eight wedding guests in all!	Er, Well # the thing is # I thought your son was a lady.
Oh dear, I didn't really mean to#	Didn't mean to?  You put your sword right through his head!
I don't want land.	Listen, Alice #
Who are you?	I'm # your son #
No #  You stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.	# and you'll come and get him.
Er # if # we # er #	Yes?
Oh, I remember # can he # er # can he leave the room with us?	No #.  keep him in here # and make sure he doesn't #
Where are you going?	We're coming with you.
Well, she's got a point.	We'll cover your escape!
Oh!	Don't say that word.
Stop saying the word!	Stop saying the word!  The word we cannot hear!  The word #
So?	So, there are rules.  Things you do and things you don't do.
And she sent no word down?	They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?
What are you doing?!	I'm getting dressed.
She'll drop you.  When she's done with you, she'll drop you.	Get out.  Out!
What's your name?	Mary Taylor, sir.
It's the Queen's decision.	I beg your pardon?  Mama#?
I wish to see my mother.	She's busy.
Do you?	Yes.  I do.
They don't see it.	See what?
I promised to protect her from people like you.	For once in my life, I am not the issue.
Mr Brown.	Ma'am.
Mr Brown.	Yes, ma'am.
What are those?	What?
They're ready now.	I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.
What is it, John?  John?	I heard something.
Must they always follow us?	I ordered it.  It's for your own safety.
John?	Yes, ma'am?
Ma'am?	Yes?
I stay here because I am happy.  Is that such a terrible crime?	No, ma'am.
This is my good John Brown.	Yes.
What did he want?	To know when he'll be king.
We're going to lose.	You can't know that for sure.
A fine choice, sir.	Excellent!
I'm sorry, ma'am?	Cold is good!
It's Mr Brown, ma'am.	What is he doing there?
How long has he been this sick?	A few days, ma'am.
Read it.	Again?
Who told them that?	I have no idea.
There is one other matter.	What is it?
Nick, Alex, how are we today?	How'd you know it was us?
Sick?	Everybody's sick, huh?  It's fifteen after.  We always meet here, you know that.
Liar.  Did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right?	I came from the city on the left.
So where is he?	Guess he took off#  You have his keys, right?
Hello?	Hey, kid.
Nick#	Have you played the game yet?  It's incredible!  I was just#
I have to talk to you.	We are talking#
Alex, you don't know how long I've waited for this.	Funny.
Can you turn off the game?	I'm in the middle of it#
Happy?	No.  Look, I know you're not going to believe me, but listen anyway#  I think the game's alive somehow.
Something's happened to them.	It's the middle of the night.  They're asleep.  Phone didn't wake them.
Because I didn't know where else to go.	It's two o'clock in the morning.  Go home. Go to sleep.  We'll figure something out in the morning.
It's not this weird.  It'll make sense. Everything gets weird this late anyway, right?	Sure.
We have to find out what's happened to them. I think they're gone#	No way.
Then leave her.	We can't#
Where do we go?	My house.  I want to try something.
That's what I thought.	What?
Anywhere.  We have to stop it from getting out.	It's already out.
You mean we learn the rules#	And beat it at it's own game.
What Alex is trying to say is that it "seems" like it's alive.	No I'm not#
Jesus Christ!	I can't believe you made it!
Alex#	You didn't hear me?
You're not coming, Alex.	Yes I am#
You don't get it, do you?	What?
You feel it?  It's different this time.	We're actually inside, aren't we?
Okay.  Give us a kiss?	One.  In case#
Our time's up.	What?!  There's nothing here!
We can't reach that!	We don't have a choice!
Christ#no time#	There never is.
Go for it.	Hold my keys, then.
So how did you do it, Alex?	Well, it's a long story#
How did you get here?  Did you play the game?!	Yes#
Then we'll go home?	Then we'll go home.
Which way?	That way.
It's the wrong way!	In this world, wrong is right!
It's here!!!	Oh God#oh god#
What did he do to you?	Is that your question?
Mom?  You're alive#	Of course I am.
I love you, Alex.  I never wanted to leave. You know that, don't you?	Yes#but#how did you#
Is#is that where we are?  Did I die?	Not yet, honey#
So what do you think?	Sign me up.
Cool.	Can you say anything but "cool"?
So start at the beginning#	Give her a chance, will you?
Ray did # and then they closed the set#. everybody's gone. You'd better get down here Adam!	No.
Someone's shut off my money!	I know.  Where are you Adam?
So what's the problem?	There is no problem.
You'd better fix this, Ray!!!	I'll speak to someone.
Beautiful night.	Yeah.
Well, just stop for a little second and think about it. Will ya do that for me?	Okay, I'm thinking.
It will work out.	Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?
I guess I've come to quite a place.	Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.
Your Aunt called me.	I was afraid of that.
Get going. You don't want to be late.	Right. See ya.
There was an accident. I came here.	I understand. I saw the dress. I#I'm sorry.   Are you all right?
A car # a car accident.	Are you okay?
Hi.	Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?
No, no, I'm fine.	Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play the scene. Is there anything you'd like to say Bob# something to Betty before they begin?
You're still here?	I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.
I can call them# I can call my dad.	But you won't.
Stop# just stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened# they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before#	Before what?
Well # we'll leave her a note.	I'll go with you. She's still got some of my stuff.
No.	But, this could be serious.
What's wrong?	I don't know who I am.
Well#  what do you think about then? I mean#  well what do you think about?	What do you mean?
I don't know.	You don't remember anything else?
There's nothing?	Not that I can see.
No. Just the coffee.	We'll take our check.
Strange to be calling yourself.	Maybe it's not me.
What's wrong with that?	I'm not sure about this.
"You're still here?"	"I came back. I thought that's what you wanted."
"Really?"	"My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left#"
"Before I kill you."	"Then they'd put you in jail."
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours. Don't drink all the coke. 	Good luck!
Don't stop!	What is it? What do you see?!
I don't think#	C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.
Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.	No, no, no, I told you. They're fine. They're all real happy.
You're so easy.	Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.
What's  the matter now?	Nothing# I don't like being out in the open like this.
Why did you want to go to breakfast if you're not hungry?	I just wanted to come here.
You feel it?	Yeah.
Not here#no thanks.	Not a coke or anything?
You must come in first place to move on !	Jesus, my legs are asleep. I'll never be able to win this shit.
Is that it ?	Yeah, I'd say that's it.
Where are we ?	No time. Get him up.
Why don't you tell us what the fuck is going on ?	Why should I ?
Now where do we go ?	I don't know.
Come on, it works.	Give me a fucking#..
What are you doing ?	I'm leaving.
Hey ! Hey ! I'm talking to you !	What ?
So you're telling me you were set up ? I knew something was wrong.	I'm not listening.
So why this ?	Excuse me ?
Just remember, hold your breath as long as you can. Then go right over to that corner. The door will open and go in and up.	Okay.
You okay ?	Fine#
Do you know where you're going ?	Yes.
What about you ?	There's one more person here for me to visit.
What are you DOING here ?	I work here, remember ?
NO. Don't. You'll get a shock from hell if you touch that seat.	Who are you anyway ? What the hell is this ?
Is it over ?	Not quite#.
It's fine thanks.	Why don't you tell us a little about yourself ?
That's not to tough.	Look#
Is it over ?	Almost. Look, you two get out of here.
Don't.	What ?
Why don't you just stop fucking around and just die !	I'm sick of playing. I've got a better idea.
You think I'm that easy, Bitch ?	For once in your life, shut the fuck up.
Is it as good as I hope it is ?	Better, sir.
One moment dear# 	Sir ?
No. I was just curious if what I heard about you is true ?	What did you hear ?
What is Bruce doing ?	I don't know#..
What's next ?	I have a turn for the worse for the team !
Look he figured it out !	I can see your small business ! Look at it it's so small.
Look ! Look !	Shit, I forgot about them. Well, I guess the boss man wasn't as tough as I thought.
Was that the Old Man ?	Yes. I think he's feeling sick or something.
There ! There ! Did you see ! They're still alive !	I can see that but where ?
Thank you very much.	Goddamn it Bruce, you've cost me about thirty dollars so far.
Okay, I have five that says THIS is it for them.	I think I'll see hat action.
What the # ?	What happened ?
Listen, I was thinking, you know. Would you go, it's I think you're#	Do you want to go out with me ?
Hello.	Hi. I brought some wine.
What an incredible view !	Thank you.
Are you okay ?	Yes, Excuse me for a second.
Not now, Mom.	Wake up, we're in trouble.
Hey, you ! What the hell is going on ?	What the hell kind of cop are you ?
I think we should follow him#	I just need to sit and think for a second.
The roof is coming down#. hey, you#. Which door gets us out of here ??	Which one, this door is locked !
How's your foot ?	"How's your foot" ? This guy tried to kill us and he put us in this place, and you want to know how his foot is ?
What now ?	I want to go to sleep for about a month.
He was right behind me !	Who was that guy anyway ?
Good morning.	Good morning.
Do you still teach?	No, no, no, I gave it up ten years ago#actually it gave me up.
People said she looked like me.	I was drinking a little in those days.  I'm drinking a little these days too.
THANK YOU.	Don't mention it.
Give us a break. All you have to do is make a phone call.	I thought I told you to lose this guy.
So charge him with something#who's gonna know?	Me, I'll know!
You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?	Of course.
Bye Dad, I'll miss you.	Thanks, I needed that.
Maybe he's wet?	Maybe he's hungry.
I was hoping I'd get to meet you.	You mean, you knew about me?
Bye.  She looks a little like me when I was a little girl.	Does she?
I'm glad you're here.	You are?
Would you like#eh#to have these movies?	More than anything in the world.
Hi.	Come on in!
What's the matter?	He likes you.
Hello.	Hi.
This is really very nice of you.	It's no problem, I had a mother once myself.
Thanks#.	No THANKS!
Getting off please.	Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me.
Don't forget, the girls change their names if they got married.	I'd never do that.
I don't think anybody should change their names, that way you can always find them when you need them.	What if you don't wanna be found?
Do you think your friend's up in Heaven now, looking down on you and watching you all the time?	Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.
Hey relax, I'm not gonna break it.	Give it to me!
What are you doing? You can't go in there!	Oh no?!?!?!
It's dangerous!!	Leave me alone!!
You mean,  this ring?	Jerk! You IDIOT!!!
What's he smoking?	What do you think?
Right.	And you'd be my cousin?
Maybe not#but maybe it does. If no one told me about this, I mean#maybe they're trying to hide something.	Like what?
What's that?	Ten bucks.
Lock the door.	Bye.
Hi!	Oh, Hi, how's the investigation going?
Wait, are you saying that I don't appreciate?	I'm saying he asked me out for coffee, like a real date, when was the last time you did that?
I think this place is just fine.	You know how I feel about you.
I'm just tired.	All right, well get to bed early and don't let anybody in. Bye.
So what's wrong?	Nothing, nothing at all.
Good morning.	Well maybe for you.
Oh no, I, I#eh#I couldn't.	You couldn't?
Why not now?	What do you mean?
Did it hurt a lot?	You have no idea.
Hey, you didn't pay me!	How do I know you were gonna show us one?
Danny?	WHAT?
Can't you see it?	No.
Excuse me, what about the job?	Pardon?
Hi.	Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
I just had a terrible thought Harry.	What's that?
Would you like to come in and see my house? Just for a minute.	Okay, sure.
Home sweet home.	It's nice.
Yeah.	Are you mad at me?
Dance with me?	Here?
Rock?	See, you're not that out of touch.  You're good.
Do you want to?	Want to what?
Watch you don't knock out a fish.	Perfect.
Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her only friend in the world is dead.	I know that, but what do you want from me?
Of course not.	Then who's it for?
Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?	That's a lot of money for a little girl.
Dad?	I love this guy! 
When?	Soon honey, soon.
He's gone sweetheart. He's gone!	Get away, get away!!
Did I kill my mother?	What??
I found this.	I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?
Oh yes, oh that's great.	I'm very nervous.
I paid the money.	For this class?
Cause she's dying.	Do you think she is?
Did you read ALL these books?	Uh huh.
Are you going out somewhere?	No.
I won, I won!!!	Oh great!!
NO!	Yes!!
How old are you?	I'm eleven and a half.
It's okay sweetheart.	I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again.
Goodnight.	Goodnight.
I knew he wouldn't come.	I can't, I have to go home.
No, I'm going home.	Why? It's not dinner time yet.
Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.	Hey, we can become blood brothers.
Is that your Dad?	Yes.
Here.	Don't DO that!!
Can we go yet?	Go???
THIS!! 	HEY YOU!!!!  I'm gonna get you!!!  I'll get you!!!!
Got it!	My mood ring! It fell off! I gotta find it!
Run faster they're after us!!	I am running faster!!
Jump in the water!!	But I have my clothes on!
Get up!?	I'm tired of running away. Besides, we past this place two times already. We're not getting nowhere.
So now you'll have a mother.	I don't like her.
Like this?	Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.
Just do it.	Okay, okay.
Yeah, it's in the contract.	Well, then, I'll take it up with her.
Long trip.  Pretty nice of you to come.	Well, I'm close to her.  I wanted to meet the one that got away.
Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.	# weeks.
He can't do that to me!	We're about to find out.
I give.	I can't even say it.
I suppose it's too late to start over.	It's too late to start over.
You're going to say it, aren't you?	Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.
I did what I came to do.	Good girl.
I'll think about it.  I'm okay.	Oh, you're more than okay.
Excuse me?	I can be quick.  I can even be funny.
But I can't be dry.	Can you watch the road?
That's why Michael and I were the wrong fit.  Right from the start.	He said that, too.
So# one almost has to#	Exactly.
He'll see right through it.	Only.  If he wants to.
Who?  The jerk who's running your life?	This must be# very, very, hard on him.
When are you gonna come clean with your folks?	Don't you see#
Well, you're a little early#	I need to make some calls. Could I use# your office?
Well, sure.	But they're so down to earth, such wonderful people#
Best everything, Joe.  But I'm going to dance with you.	Dance?  You don't dance!  You learn to dance??
Wow and wow.  You have a date, after this?	Never can tell.
You miss her, huh?	No.  I've got you.
Don't you throw up on boat?	If you like.
I've been thinking a lot the last couple days.  About us, actually.	Have you.
You've sort of been# y'know, the woman in my life.	You've been the man in mine.
I can hardly wait for your wedding.	Me either.
Takes me back.	Well.
Will she like it?	Yes.
Listen up, huh? Even if you blow this deal, how big could it be?	You're right.  Easy come, easy go.
Michael? What ha#	Mike.  I can't believe I'm doing this to you on the night before your wedding.  But I think you need and deserve to know#
What happened?	It's over.
Michael#	No, it's for the best, it really is.  We were so wrong for each other.
Should we take a walk?  Or maybe some food sent up, or something#	I just want to be alone.  Is that okay?
This is her family and her fault.	And your point?
Does that make it right#	Love doesn't have to be right. It just has to be love.
Thank God you were here.	Oh, yeah.
What's up?	Shhh.
Uh.  I saw that moving#	DON'T SPEAK!
I'm so glad you didn't jump on that train, before#	I came here, looking for her.
I never forgot that.	It's two weeks.
He needs someone incredible, someone really close, who he can trust#	Like family, huh?
It would only be, maybe, six months? Or three or four? It would mean so much to him#	To him.
You got the money?	Right here.
Don't worry, I'll take care or it	You're so good.
Oh, honey, I didn't mean to scare you.	How did you come in here?
Well, I guess you caught me at a weak moment.	You'll have to speak up.
You going today?	Thank you-- Yes, I am.
Well, Bye, Bye now. We have to go.	Bye, Bye.
I appreciate your concern, but she has to rest, so you can go on home.	Oh, sure.
How is she?	A little slow, but she'll be fine.
You want anything?  A drink?	Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.
What's he running for?	President.
Okay.	Okay.
Bastard	Stop it!
President?	When is it?
You're kidding.	How come?
Where are you going?	To the bathroom.
Listen, we're suppose to sing on TV day after tomorrow. At the park#	National?
You bet.	I'll just be in here.
Mr. Green?	Yes, ma'am. How are you today?
You want me to wait?	No. Mr. Green, I don't know how to tell you this -- your wire passed away -- I thought they'd called you at home.
Yes, sir.	Can I help you?
Listen, do you know anything about cars?	A little. What do you need?
Uh huh.	She's been in the hospital two weeks yesterday.
Well, I could use one, especially if I'm pregnant.	What did you say?
Have you seen a woman about so high?	No.
Mom?	I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
Okay. I'll be talking to you.	Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you.
I'd really like to see you.	Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you.
Hello.	Hi.
Hello.	Wow!
Stay.	I can't.
When did you think it would happen?	I'm not sure.
How old are you?	Older.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.	That's what you said before.
All I need is fifteen minutes a night.	Fifteen minutes?

You don't know how pleased he'll be.	What!
Sorry I'm late.	You're not.
How's your stomach?	Pretty good. Sure was surprised to hear from you. You talk to Bill?
You know Bill is really mad at you.	Oh?
We just got a gold record.	Do they have a show to give it to you?
Come on back to bed.	Yeah, you bet. You're really terrific. You know what I mean?
Hi.	Hello.

You sure do it loud.	Is that good?
More or less.	More or less#
Thank you. Grace, there is one other thing#	What#
Mickey!	Don't stop!
Looked like an interview to me.	I said we'd give you an interview. I never said we wouldn't kill you.
Say something.	What?
How is it?	Not good.
Okay now, before we get started here, there's a few things we have to get clear about.	All right, Mickey.
Sorry about that.	Don't worry about it.
I could go for a Coke.	Could I get a Coke for Mickey?
You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?	Sure.
Mickey, can I talk to you alone?	No.
C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.	So, what now?
I can't go. I'm too fucked up.	I'm not saying it's not gonna hurt, but--
Yes.	Yes.
What the hell happened to you?	You should see the other bitch. What time you got?
Yeah, we met. They're good men.	They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?
Jack, could you stay up here for a while?	Yeah, sure.
You met the kids I have working for me? Great bunch, aren't they?	Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.
Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?	Lose 'em.
Where' you goin'?	Out.
Want to keep your job, boy?	What d'you think?
I said: Cut it out!	Don't start no trouble, boy!
I know.	You' new here, man!  See you, boys.
Yeah.	Where was that?
Thanks.	Would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
That's two bucks, Joe.	Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
Thank you, Ma'am. That's fine.	You must be new in town.
Haven't seen you around, have I?	No. I'm new in town.
Oh yeah?	You work around town?
Hell!	What is it?
Ain't your fault.	That's the way he is.
How old is your boy?	Four.
Hi.	I thought you wasn't comin'.
How did it go?	What?
What d'you mean?	Just what I said. Don't look so scared.
Thank you.	How about it?
I can see why.	Well, what d'you think?
What about him?	He could live with us.
Is that so?	Yeah, that's so.
What about them?	Am I as good as they?
You know how to box?	Uh-huh. Why?
Like so. There you go. Okay, hit me!	I don't want to hurt you.
Ain't that something?!  That's just fine, baby.	We'll be all right.
Yeah. But just how're we goin' to make out? I got to get me a job.	You will.
Hi.	Don't ask, baby - huh!  How much money you got with you?
Don't do that!	Watch out!
You heard me!	I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
Ain't you goin' to say something?	There's nothing to say.
Where're you going to go?	When I get set, I'll send for you.
Just get her drunk.	How 'bout the key?
How about a drink?	Okay.
I asked you somethin', boy!	I heard you.
Couldn't get the words out before.	Better get him to a hospital.
How you doin', boy?	Okay.
Want me to hold the light for you?	No, thanks.
Seems a little loose!	She'll do.
Jesus, I told you to watch it!	Sorry.
That's the trouble with you boys! Don't listen when a man tells you something.	She don't look no worse to me.
Come back some other time, will you?	Yeah, sure. Good luck.
Come on, Pop.	Nothing you can do. Been like this for days.
Want to come up the house? You can stay there till you get on your feet. There's no point paying a hotel.	No thanks, Lee.
Hello.	How are you?
It's hard to know how to talk to the white folks these days.	Guess it's never been easy.
I know just how you feel, son. But believe me, you're going about it the wrong way.	Don't look like there's a right way.
So I been told.	It's for your own good.
Come on, Will.	What's the matter?! You mad at me?
He's your son.	Okay, boy, beat it.
Now you stay put!	I ain't drunk, honey.
Let's go.	Anything you say, baby.
Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?	No. I only needed the code from you.
Take this off.	He wants to kill you, you know# Perhaps I won't allow it.
Alright. Let's talk business.	Why not?
You ran without us.	I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
Tell me the words.	The words?
I saw your girl yesterday.	I don't have a girl.
What you're telling me is that I'm dead. Right?	Right#

You've been calling her name.	What?
Holy shit#	Hey# you're not supposed to be up.
How long have I been out?	Almost two days.
That's not going to help.	The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.
I'm going in.	You're not ready yet. They said two days.
#Feels like you.	Case#

Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.	Yeah, I know.
Go away. I have enough work here to last me all night.	Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
Hi. You're here for the sex talk?	Well. I like a man who gets to the point.

"Surprise!" you were doing a story on me?!	No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
Please. Please don't walk away.	I just can't look at you the same way.
Yes.	What?
Rob, what do you want to be when you grow up?	Well, a ball player.
Are you having fun?	Yeah. Definitely.
By name.	Lock.
He has to know#	Everybody knows about--
Not at all!	We can handle it.
He sure is big, Jack#	And heavy#
Where're we taking him?	Where?
Yes.	For this.
Yes.	Didn't I tell you?  I'm always right, you know, my dear# Aren't I?
You're mine, you know.  I made you.	I know.
I do the best I can to make it comfortable for us here.	I know.
Coming#	Good.  I'm hungry.
Taste it.	But why?  It's your lunch. There isn't much there in the first place.
But I have to go out. Something's happening out there.	Whatever it is, it's none of your concern.
Uh-huh.	He stayed a long time.
                                          # You're no fun.	                      Shut up and listen#!
Where are you going?	Just out for a while.
Help me with this thing!	It's not the gas, Dad!
I don't know.  COuldn't get the right price, I suppose.	And you don't know anything about a murder across the street and a crazy girl who lived here - who saw the whole thing?
Wanna join your little friend?	Where's Jesse?
I love you, Jesse.  Come back to me.	He's dead, you bitch.
Jesus Christ, you scared the shit out of me!	I'm sorry#
What?	It's happening again.
Aren't you afraid somebody could steal your car like that?	Look at this car.  Are you kidding?
Hi!  You didn't have to wait.	That's okay, I wanted to.
You okay?	Yeah, yeah, sure.
I figured you might like some help.	Yeah?
Are you sure?	World History.  But, I'll see you in the morning, right?
No. Never.  You think that's what it is?	I don't know.
What's all this.	Research.  Hi.  C'mon, let's go for a ride.
Here.	What's this?
So, you feeling anything?	What do you mean?
What is it - What's wrong?	Whoa!
It's gone now.	Oh, Jesse#
Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?	I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.
You should eat something - you'll feel better.	I'm not hungry.
I think I better go.  I'm just not into it tonight.  I'm sorry.	Why won't you talk to me?
You're not being fair to me.  I'm worried about you and I want to help you get through this thing.	What are you gonna do?  How are you gonna help?  I'm losing my mind.  I don't want to have you watch me fall apart.
Jesse, God - what happened?	I killed him!  I killed him!
Who, Jesse?	he's just waiting to take me.  When I sleep.
You created him - you can destroy him. He lives off your fear.  Fight him, Jesse!	I can't!
Hi.	Hi.
So, school going alright?	Okay, I guess.
Maybe we should call a doctor.	No.  I'm okay.
I'm not taking drugs, Dad.  Can I go to bed now?	Sure#go ahead.
Jesse, please, let's talk about this!	I'm okay.  Just leave me alone.
Morning.	How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
There's a Jesse on the phone.	Okay#thanks.
What's that?	We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow night.
We're going up to bed now.	Thanks, Mom.
Are you crazy?  You'll wake the whole neighborhood!	Hi Mom.
And you don't want to keep him waiting.	That's right.  I don't.
Honey, you'll wake the whole neighborhood!	Mom?
What?	I had such an awful dream.
Can we talk?  Just for a minute?	Can't it wait till morning?
Girl, what are you doing?	Watching TV.
If you get caught, I never saw you. Deal?	Deal.  Thanks.
You didn't think we'd let you go alone?	No fuckin' way.  We're a team.
What's happening?	He's close#
I'm glad things have worked out for you.	I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.
It was great seeing you again.  I'm glad you dropped by.	Do you still#see each other?
You pulled me in somehow, didn't you?	I -- I think so!
That man in my dreams.  He's real isn't he?	He's real.
I haven't been able to do that since I was a little girl.	You did it the other night.
What's that?	I don't know.
Are you okay?	I think so.
Hi, sweet stuff.  Good news.	Can't be good news coming from you.
You need me, I'll be here all night.	Thanks, Max.
You got five minutes.	Thank you.
Well, if it isn't my little girl# come to visit her Daddy.	It's been a long time.
You're late.	Didn't get much sleep.
This is nice.	Never been here before?
To who?	Doesn't matter.
We can try again.	Everybody take five.
What are we going to do?	There's nothing we can do.  It's out of our hands.
We've got work to do.	What are you talking about?
What was that?	What?
Somebody else is out here.	No.  We're alone.
Science#I suppose.	A sad choice.
Why is he after us?	Yeah?  What did we ever do?
We're here.	Where#here?
I'm in.	Me too.
No!	Night, night, Honey.
No, thanks.  I'll just look around.	Fine.
Oh Jesus.	Here, let me help.

Hello.  Hi.  Hi.	Hi.
Hi.	Hello.
Are you busy tonight?	Yes.
So who left who?	She left me.
I'm sorry.	No, that's fine.  I love that you tried# time was I'd have done the same.
I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that.	No, you were brilliant
Here we are.  Do you want to come up?	There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.	You've got to go.
Hi.  Can I come in?	Come in.
You've got big feet.	Yes.  Always have had.
Wow.	What?
Can I stay a bit longer?	Stay forever.
What?	Don't ask.
How are you doing?	How do you think I'm doing?
Now stop.  Stop.  I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea.	I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home.
This is certainly# ah#	I only found out you were here yesterday.
Hi.	Hello.
I thought I'd give it to you.	Thank you.  Shall I#
Yes#	Who is it?
Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job.	I'm sorry.  Is this a problem?
Excuse me.	Yes.
That's right.	And this is William.
Quickly, quickly -- talk very quickly what are you doing here with Anna Scott?	Anna Scott?
But she said she wanted to go out with you?	Yes -- sort of#
Bloody hell, this is fun.	Is Miss Scott staying here?
By the way -- it's you.	Me?
I was called and I came.  What's up?	William has just turned down Anna Scott.
What happened?	It was good.
Ah -- no.  It's fine.	What's your name?
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.	Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
You didn't know she had a boyfriend?	No -- did you?
Well?	She's perfect, perfect.
Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I don't know anything about this.	Is it someone we know?
Oh God no.	So not over her, in fact.
Hello.	May I help you, sir?
No, sir.	Right.  Right.  Fair enough.  Thanks.
Can I help you?	Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott#
Cool, huh?	Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.	Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
Hey.	Hi#
Oh my God#  Hello.	Hello.  I wonder if I could have a little word.
I wouldn't go outside.	Why not?
Which floor?	Three.
Are you sure you#?	Yes.
Excuse me.	Yes.
Get up, Billy.	No! No! No!
Yes, ma'am#	Will you come with me, please.
I'm not finished yet.	Go on#
Say it again.	Thank you.
In there.	Wow! They're so quiet.
Wait a minute#	It's okay, Rose. You can go with him.

Big king, too bad#	Just wait till you hear#
Shhh. Wait a minute. You guys are gonna screw up my plans. So just gone on back to bed like nothin' happened.	No! I wanna go!
Gimme the ball!	No. Me! Me!
I wanna see it#	Me too! Me too!
I wanna go home!	Yeah, it's cold!
My turn.	No.
Jesus God#	What is it?
How are you feeling?	Just fine, Doc# In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here.
Time out!	Time out!
Yeah, buddy?	Are you a doctor?
You think it's funny, huh?	Yeah, you don't know how to get outta this place!
You want me to show ya! You want me to show ya how!	Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!
Bullshit. You ain't got no way out!	Oh, yeah?
Somebody's coming!	Shhh!  This way!
Got a cigarette?	Sure#
Hey, how ya doin'?	Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these.
Please follow me.	You an' me, Chief.
He's a patient, Rose#	Oh, yeah#
Who is he?	He's in charge.
Hi.	Hi.
Yeah!	Big man!
Yes, sir, I sure am gonna enjoy my stay here.	I'm sure you will.
We got your black ass now, Washington, wanna bet another twenty?	No way#
What happened?	What's that?
Well, Miss# I would say# I would say, yes. Yes, he's crazy.	I thought so.
She was your sister.	No, she wasn't my sister.
Great.  Because, like I said, until you find it, we can't let you on the plane.	You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?	Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.
No#  it's just very important that I find him, okay?	Why?
So, what's the story with your friend?	My friend has lost her fucking mind#
No, really.  What's she doing?	Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
My hair's kind of a mess, isn't it?	Your hair# is perfect.
Good.	Let's find a telephone.
Don't be afraid.  You can tell me.	You're sure#
Who's dying?	Your great aunt.
There is one other thing you should know about me.	Nothing you could say would change the way I feel.
A very large pig.	Ask her if she knows where he is?
No.	Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?
Larry!  What are you doing here?  Mom sent you.	No.
I'll bring it back as soon as I can.	But Faith--
You#	Hi there#
Congratulations.	Thanks.
It's an amazing place, don't you think?	Amazing.
I'm sure he'll be sorry to hear that.  Who should I tell him called?	My name's 
WAIT!!  Where are you?	I'm at the airport.  Why?
That's not the point.	You said whatever it was you would understand.
How could you do this to me?	I'm in love with you.
Why can't you just tell me?	If it's any of your business, yes.
Don't you see?..  We're not the ones who are meant to be.  You're the man of somebody else's dreams.	Because I don't have the right name?!
Why not?	Because.  I know where he is.
Why?	Because-- I want you to be happy.
Uh, I'd rather not say.	Tell me.
He's out by the pool right now.	Right now?
Do you want me to do it?	NO.
Hi, Peter.	Hi.
So.  You found him.	You found him.  I don't know how to thank you.
Oh, thanks.  Well, have a good time.	You too.
Hey--	What?
What?#	What are you doing here?
You okay?	Yeah.
I'm sorry.	I feel like the world's biggest idiot.
Promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye.	No.  Course not.
Hi.	Hi.  Are you# busy?
It seems like ever since I found out about this guy, this name, I've been kind of crazy.  Like I was on drugs or something.	I know the feeling.
Yes.  I am.	In that case# no#
Is something the matter?	GET OUT!!
Alright.  The truth is# I thought we had something here.	I can't believe you did that!
Really?#	Yes.
I was hoping for the real thing.	I brought you that, too.
Hello.	Beautiful place#
Been here long?	Just since yesterday.
I was wondering#  Do you have dinner plans?	Tonight?
Sure.	You would?  Really?
I'll look forward to it.	Okay.  Good.  See you then, then.
Wait.	Yes?
Well, to-- new friends.	And more#
Faith, this is my mother.	Oh, hello.
So, what are we waiting for?	What?
I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it#  Is Larry here?	Yeah.  He's around somewhere.
I wish you didn't have to go so early.	Yeah, well, Larry and his friends are hungry.  And I did say I'd try to pick something up.
No.	Is he married?
But what?	Oh, I don't know.  I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be.  You know, like in the movies.
Have you seen him with someone?	No#  I can just tell.
You okay?	Sure.  I'm fine.  I don't know why I never did this before.  I mean, what's the big deal?
I can't believe we came all this way and he's gone.	You gave it your best shot.  You tried.
What are you doing?	He fell out.
Ah ha!#	What'd you find?
We're saved!	What is it?
Your brother?	What was I gonna do?  Tell him the truth?
Anna, I'm Faith.  You don't know how happy I am to meet you.  You see, I'm trying to find someone, and--	Her brother.
What did you say to her?	I don't know.  I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?	Because I'm the one who's single.
Faith--	What?
That was really sweet#	I meant about my idea.
I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.	I know, but#
No.  No, you go ahead.	You sure you'll be okay?
Peter found him?	Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
Maybe I can change him.	I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.
He's a jerk.	Yes.  He is.
So#	So.  I guess I've got a wedding to go to.
Well# I ought to be getting home anyway.  The kids'll be back from camp soon.  The house is probably a mess.	And Larry?#
I'm fine.  Have you seen Peter?	He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.
No, you don't understand.  It's been wonderful meeting you.  But# I have a husband.  I have two kids at camp.  I have a life I have to go back to.	You don't have to go if you don't want to#
This is the last one before the wedding, right?	Right.
I came after the woman I love.	He missed me.
I have to talk to her.	She's not here.
That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?	Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?
Oh, it's you.  It's only Peter.	Thanks.
Right now?	He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.
You got a real friend here, kid. Don't forget it.	Why should he forget it?
You said they was only going to talk to him.	That was the idea.
Come on, kid. I'll buy you a drink.	In a minute.
Working hard?	It's a living.
River Street? I thought we was going to the Garden.	I've got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.
What happened?  What happened?	Tommy, what happened?
I'd better go in.	I only live up there and across the roof.
I changed my mind. I feel real mean tonight.	Good. So do I.
Listen, you like beer?	I don't know.
Jimmy#	He's going to have to grow up too.
Where you goin'?	Let me by.
You can!	I can? Okay.  Okay#
Never will be much too soon.	Take it easy.
Where you going? I'll walk along with you.	Sure# .
Is Johnny in?	No.
Count this.	Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
You got some nerve.	What do you mean?
You know what I mean. Leave her alone.	I was only talkin' to her.
Well we certainly can't stay here. C'mon.	Where?
Look!	Be careful!--They'll see you.
I love you Bob. I really do. Forgive me?	There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.
The time#is short.	For what!?!
They are live ones?	Yes, Master.
Have we in some way made you angry, Master?	You know better than that.
I want to speak with you, please.	Who is it?
Lie face down on the floor.	What?!
The FBI didn't tell you I was with them?	They didn't tell me anything, they asked questions.
You didn't visit him in prison.	He didn't want me to.
Ask him his name.	Who are you?
You're good.	Thank you.
We may as well leave her, we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what's the difference where?	She's coming with us.
I'm just saying she wasn't scared.	Cause she had her hand on her gun the whole time, waiting to make her move.
What?!	You better come see this.
Outside of that.	Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us.
Now that's a really big house.	Jesus, look at that wall.  Place almost looks like a prison.
They put a gun on you, you'll go back.	They put a gun on you, you still have a choice, don't you?
And she saw you?	Yes, she did.
You know they gonna set us up.	I get that feeling, yeah.
They found the safe.	You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
Come on.	Shit.
We made it, didn't we?	All you gotta do is get in.
I'm going back inside.	I'll go with you.
Put it down or I'll shoot.	You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
You can live or die, it's up to you.	Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot me?  Nice girl like you?  I don't think so.
Quite a mess.	Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
Other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together.  You gonna tell me why you're comin' to me instead of the FBI?	I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.
Hello?	We're a few minutes away.  Just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand?
Soon as we leave here.  Stop home and pick up what we need and go do it.	Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.
You know how to use one a these?	I've seen 'em used on TV.
Good luck, Richard.	Someone down here?
You don't seem all that scared.	Of course I am.
I never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick.	Really.
Get your hands up and turn around. Now.	Shit#
You know who this is?	Yes.
Oh, God#	I called your room from downstairs.
You really wear that suit.	That's not what you were about to say.
What were you gonna do with me?	I don't know.  I hadn't worked that part out yet.  All I knew was that I liked you, and I didn't want to leave you there, never see you again.
You know I saw you on the street.	Where?
You coming back?	I'm just going to the bathroom.
I want you to know something.  I wasn't looking for just a fuck, if that's what you're thinking.	Why are you mad?
You getting serious on me now?	I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know what's gonna happen.
I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot you.	You just did, for Christ sake.
Whose blood you got all over you?	These guys, man, they're crazy.  Shit.
I thought you guys were busted.	Why?  Just because you left us standing on the side of the road?
Some people are going out of here. What if I told you where and when?	How many?
Thanks for your help.	Any time.
Tell me something.  What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up?	I don't know.  I never used a gun.
I still haven't made up my mind yet.	What's to think about?
What do you want from me, Jack?  Name it.  You want money?	You gonna write me a check?
Do we have a gun in the car?	I remember you now.  Shit.
You there?	Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here. Question is, why aren't you here?
Thing I'm worried about is you.	Me?
That was some shit, huh?	Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
Hi, Ray.	You look great.  Your dad taking good care of you?
How's it going?	Great.  We got one of 'em.
You like to sit down?	Thanks.
It's beautiful.	It's a --
Thanks, Dad.	Happy birthday, kid.  You want another Coke?
You were talking in your sleep.	What'd I say?
He doesn't even look like that.	No?
Hello?  Yeah, she is.  Just a minute.  For you.	Hello?
You gonna go get him?	It's possible.  Why?
You here all by yourself?	That's right, just me.
#the fuck is this#	Are they dead?
What is it with Red?  I've never seen him this way.	He's been like that all day.  Hey Danny, you coming?
Now listen, it's hands off Billy.  I mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours.	He was that good?
I wish she could forget him.	You don't forget love, Honey.  Not ever.
They ready, Earl?	They'll all fly, but -- oh, shit#
Who the fuck taught you to fly?	He did.
How could you do this?	The Colonel helped me work it out.
Didn't you say you told her not to come?	Yeah.
You'd always go sit in a plane whenever you were upset.	Upset?  Why should I be upset?
Sorry.	Why be sorry?  That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it.
Get me into a plane!	Come on!
You hear my okay?	Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.
Land of the free.	Home of the brave.
Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna make it.	What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral?
Fun today.  Like old times.	Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
Danny#	I can't make it.
So beautiful!	Hang on.
I heard what you did.	We can explain, Colonel.
Hello, Lieutenant.  Good to see you.	You too, Lieutenant.
Oh, this is Betty.	Nice to meet you, Betty.
Danny's not coming?	No, he#got some news today.  He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.
Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good, is it.  Or it wouldn't be so hard to say.	The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it.  But I've got to because it's true.  I love you.  That must surprise you.
There's one thing I have to say.  I'm going away.	We're all going away.
It's been#so different, being so sure you were dead.	I'm so sorry for what you must've gone through, but I'm back.
What else can we do?	There's nothing you can do here, they'll die or they won't, we just --
I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change.	Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
The only one?	Well, besides Charlie, of course.
They're waiting. Come on.	I can't. It's all too much.
Where is it?	Were taking you back to the nurse.
We're going to take you home.	That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember the way.
I'll call you Later.	Yes. Let's stay in touch.
He is kind of cute, isn't he?	Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
What's the matter?	It's that jerk Walter.
But you love me don't you?	Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
How do you feel?	Pretty strange.
Want me to drive you home later?	Would you?
Looking good out there.	Thanks.
I'm sorry Charlie.	Save it.
I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.	That's real big of you.
Does this mean you like me again?	It means I care about you and what happens to you.
Let me got! Where are you taking me?	Right here. Now sit down.
Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore.	How could you possibly know what I've been going through?
I love you.	I know.
It couldn't be me.  I hardly knew him.	I'll just set it right here.
Hello, Charlie.	Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
Did you study for the test?	Test?
It's Charlie!	What a treat.
I thought I knew everything about him.	Can we split now?
Young lady, you're drunk!	Just a little. I've had a tough day.
Damn that Charlie I	It's not Charlie. It's me.
For me?	Open it.
Jack, I was just trying to help.	We'll make it, we'll be fine.
Mom!	The nurse called and said you'd be coming home.
I have a note.	How do you feel?
My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast.	Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young.
What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up?	Oh. I forgot.
Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him?	What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.
Would you get that, dear?	Sure, Mom.  Hello.
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?	For what?
What are you doing?	I'm just happy to see you.
Okay, you're not dead, but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible.	What if it's beyond science? What it it's God?
Richard! They don't have any! They never heard of them! Isn't that wonderful?	What are you talking about?
Hi, Richard.	What are you doing?
What's the matter?	It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
You want some advice, friend? You get in your car, you pick up your family# and you get the hell out of that town.	Well# uh# thanks#
What's a lunch cost these days? You want ten?	Sure.
You nervous? New town, new school. I know it must be pretty hard for you#	I'll be fine, Dad.
What?	You alright?
Hey! Where're you off to?	I'm going out, Dad!
All set?	All set.
So where're we going?	Anywhere but here.
It's getting pretty late. We better go.	Yeah#
Maybe he wasn't dead when we buried him.	He was dead. You know he was.
You think my Dad'll figure out why he's not getting better?	You think he'd believe it if he did?
It's weird#	What do you mean?
What was that all about? You think he's trying to scare us?	I don't know but I'm not taking any chances#
You ever think about running away?	All the time.
How long have you been here?	Couple minutes. I saw the last shot. That was pretty cool.
I know, Mom.	You know everything, don't you?
Jesus.	I don't know what to do, Bob.
What in God's name# ?	Bob#
Do you really think so, Andy?	Yes, Bob, I do.  Excuse me? Am I being fired?
Thanks, you guys.	Yeah. Thanks, guys.
You're leaving the hospital? You're going into the office looking like that? Are you insane?	One hour!
What's wrong with you?	Close the law book.
I'm ready#	Ready for what, baby?
Thanks for coming in.	Of course.
I know that, Charles.	More than your friend. Family.
Client of yours?	Funny.
New baby?	One week old.
Who'd you get?	What?
I'm a law suit.	Not bad.
Are you a good lawyer?	I'm an excellent lawyer.
Thanks for coming by.	You bet. We'll see you later.
Do you need a break?	No.
Hello?	Hi, Mom. It's me.
Andy! This is a nice surprise. How are you, hon?	I'm fine.
He was losing weight. He looked kind of tired sometimes. But he was working so hard# Still, I felt something was wrong.  And I can't believe they're saying they didn't notice anything.	Objection.
We're going to draw blood.	Why are we going to do that?
Andy. Before we begin, I'd just like to say: everyone in this room is your friend.	You're in trouble.
Good school. What year?	Second.
Don't you know this is exactly the kind of bullshit that makes people hate you guys?	Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try?  Asshole.
You load the film# ? No, on this side# or this side? Don't move the baby!	Give me the camera, Joe.
Joe?	Yeah# ?
I'll see you in an hour, max.	Night, honey.
Yeah. But we took care of him.	How did you do that?
You taught him a lesson.	Yes, we did.
Let's continue.	You had one guy "like that?"
I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to#	# But now, we're standing up for ourselves#
Tell me that was you.	Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
Oh, Lord#.	It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just#.
Bring the light!	What're they doing? What're we --
Back to the ship, huh?	Get out of our way.
How many you see?	One or two.
As fast as you can.	You sure you can keep --
Just come with me!	Got a better idea. Come with me.
They're already dead. Get on board.	You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
You'd die for them?	I would try for them.
What do my eyes see?	It's starting#.
Christ, you don't know what's out there!	I know what's in here!
Hey.	Hey, who?
And him?	Big Evil?
No, no, I wanted to get away.	So I noticed. Never seen a "captain" quite so ready to leave her ship.
So now you know.	Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than I thought.
Didn't bite.	What?
Sorry. Thought I heard something.	Like what?
You said we were going to trust him now. You said there was a deal.	That's what I said.
We aren't completely stupid.	Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in the fucking --
One is all?	For now.
They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them.	And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
Oh, no. No, no, no#.	Rain.
Well#we must keep her close, then. Here, she'll be safe if we put her between --	There is no "safe."
We got you#it's okay, it's okay#we got you now#.	The child heard you before any of us could even#.
You'd cut me loose, Boss?	Only if we both get outta this alive. And there may be a way.
Are you fuckin' kidding me?	Not afraid of the dark, are you?
Fuck me. You said "clear."	Said "looks clear."
What's her name, anyway?	What do you care?
Take it.	What, it's broken?
Yes. I have to agree. From all you've found so far, his position's as good as yours.	What are you doing there?
Do you have to work tonight?	No.
That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.	What's so special about him?
Where there's one there's another. And another. And another.	Let's find them all.
Which one was wearing the strange clothes?	Him.
Gone.	We're here to stay.
If only we could get a fix.	What would you learn? I've told you where you are and when you are.
Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?	Don't bother
Shouldn't we be moving on?	I'm for that.
I told you not to bring the other one.	He wouldn't leave her.
Who put them up?	The Hunt Club.
Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case.	Why special?
Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling better?	Listen, listen -- I can speak --
You! # You knew about this?	No, I swear -- I never saw this man before.
Are you going to take her with you?	Yes.
Taylor, please -- don't treat him that way.	Why not?
Would you like to come along?	We can't.
I SHIT on all o' you.	KILL YOU MOTHERFUCKER!!!
So what's the problem?	Says he can't walk.
Uh# Bob. Like to speak to you. Take a minute.	Yeah, what is it?
Come on man!	No!
Hey Taylor, you okay man?	Yeah. How 'bout you?
First time?	Yeah.
Feel good?	Yeah. No pain in my neck now. Feels good.
#But what'd she do?	What didn't she do. She fucked the living shit outta me, that's what she did!
I'll go with you.	No# I move faster alone. 
Okay - got light duty, three days.	Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
Must be somebody?	#there's nobody.
Same as an hour ago. Remember? I'm the steady type.	I'm afraid there's nothing I can do about it, Mr. Mitchell.
You could tell me your name. And where you're going.	How far does this train go?
I think I'd like to dance.	Why certainly, baby.
Please be a little more careful how you talk, Mr. Mitchell.	How careful should I be?
I think you're drunk.	Just drunk enough.
They might think I was running away from something.	Possibly, Miss.
You can have the table yourself, if you'd rather. I'm only killing time.	No, please.
Dance?	No thank you.
They'll know whether he killed himself.	I don't.
Go ahead#if you want to. It doesn't matter.	I'd rather wait until it does matter.
You tried to run away.	There wasn't any plane.
Bad?	Bad enough.
What time is it?	Quarter after one. Why?
Cold?	Is this the best you can do?
Want to dance?	Dance? Here?
It still doesn't matter if I kiss you?	Nothing matters.
That's the second round I've lost tonight.  That fellow hurt me.	So have I.
Well?	You leave it.
I decided I didn't want a drink#I'm beginning to wonder.	Wonder what?
In a way.	If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
Please answer my question.	You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
What this?	Yes.
I'll find out, you know. Perhaps not today--perhaps not tomorrow. But in the end, I'll find out.	The police always do, don't they?
You won't tell me who you are? You won't even give me a chance to help you?	Nobody can help me. You, least of all.
This isn't a very good place to talk.	I don't want to talk.
I expected nothing else.	I might be able to save you.  If I knew enough.
You've got a couple of hours, maybe.	To do what?
He could have killed me a dozen times.  You'd never have known.	We know everything.
There's two hundred. I'll meet you in an hour--where we met last night	Why not here?
You make friends quickly, don't you, Clark?	Sometimes.
I'm sorry. This thing has just knocked me silly.  How long do we have to wait for this police character?	Until he comes. He's a nice guy. You've met him.
What?	A private joke.
Would it have helped if I'd knocked him down?	Hardly. Who's the girl?
Thank you.	Yes, I've seen it before.
Could be.	I rather thought so. And before that, had you ever seen the gun?
How about a cup of coffee?	No thanks. I had some. How would you like to take a walk for, say, half and hour?
In case you want to have us followed.	I don't.
Thanks.  Lovely view you have, haven't you?	I never notice the view after the first week.
I had a father who knew how to steal.	What?
What's the matter, baby. Don't you like me anymore?	Lay off, can't you?
What are you doing here?	I don't think you locked your door.
Got a moment, Inspector?	I've got a year.  Or a second. I'm not sure which.
You in charge here?	So it seems Sergeant.
# I supposed you knew her, too, Inspector.	I've met her.
Not too hard, is it?	Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
May you what?	Oh nothing.
I never saw it before.	Positive?
What about me?	Not quiet yet.
No.	I hear she's a very pretty girl.
Get out of here!	What are my orders, sir?
I seem to remember that you like to help yourself.	That's not very kind.
What's this?	What does it look like?
She is beautiful. And young.  No thank you.	I say YES!
I do worry about Susan.  Have you known her long?  She hasn't mentioned you.	Actually, we've only just met. But we're quiet good friends.
Thank you.	We'll see you next week, and if--
Hello.  Anyone for a walk?  Tom isn't, I can tell you.	Well, we were just#
Shall we go?	Yes.
Give them here.  This tells you how the Women's Peace Camp came to be set up.  All local women at first, then we had support from women and men all over the country.	Very good.
How's Mary?	She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.
James# I can't begin to tell you how pleased we all are.  Congratulations, and I really mean it.	Thank you.
So it's all worked out perfectly#	That's her.
Can I give you a lift?	No, it's all right.  I can get a cab.  Night night.
Damn.  They're early.	Who?
Again?	Yes, if you like.  Call me at work.
Why not stay?	I have to be up early. 
You don't trust me.	I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television.
Do you think she's invited you up for her sake or for mine?	I haven't really thought about it.
Look, will you come on a walk with me tomorrow?	I might.
Might?	Yes.  Might.  Remember, you're here to talk to my mother.
We don't seem to get much time to talk.	I know.  I'm sorry.
Now, top secret file.	Come on.  Hand over.
Uh-huh.  Tell me what you think of this first.	It's shit.
That's enough of that.	We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
Still in love?	I'm not sure.
Susan and I are very old friends, James.	Fuck off.
Hello.	Hello.
Hello, Jimmy.	Dad.
I've got to be going.  I've got a meeting tonight.	The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
What have you got there?	You'd look naked without one.
We'll see what we can do.	Promise?
Don't close the door.  Don't turn out the hall light.	I won't.  Goodnight.
Don't you want to walk, Tom?	No.
Gonna be some people at my house tonight.  Maybe you can make it.	Where?
I gotta be fucking crazy.	Yeah, but are you crazy enough?
Ever done this before?	Once.
We gonna jump or jerk off?	My man!
Don't screw around man, pull it!	You do it# you first!
You're a fucking dead man--	Whoa, whoa!!  Think it through!  I'm the only one knows where they are. Just let me talk for a second.
I'm not armed.	But you're not alone.
Go on, Johnny.  Pull it.  But you gotta drop the gun, first!  Right?! You use your other hand what you gonna hold on with?	Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!
Three seconds# two# one#	SHIT!!
You sure he isn't out back?  You mind if I go take a look?	Look, I don't know anything about your dog, okay--
You know less than nothing.  If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't.	Yes, sir.
How was the beach?	Fine.
I think you gotta hit them straight on!	Got it#
No, but there are four guys back there you might check out.	Thanks, buddy.
The hell are they?!	They took a left at the next light!
Nothing?	Nothing.
I know where they're going.	Figured you did.
Stop here.  Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it?	Sure.
Who's the girl?	Catch of the day.
You had enough?	Yeah.  I just want to sit out here for a minute.
Look at you.	What?
Those are cold.	Warm them up.
I# I gotta go.	Johnny# what's going on?  I don't get it# did I do something?
Hey!  Uh, how do I get back in?	Carefully, tough guy.  Very carefully.
What the hell do you think you're doing?	We're going to need everyone.
I'll see you there.	Right behind you.
You saw what?	I saw it.
You lift off in three hours.  There's one other thing.	What's that, General?
Your uncle will like this.	He's not really my uncle.
It's# it's not like that.	I see.  Well.  Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then.
You don't know anything about me.	I'd like to find out.  You don't know anything about me either. That's why people have lunch.
Congratulations, sir.	What?
Who are you going after next, sir?	Who indeed#
Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?	What's that?
Nice car.  Yours?	No.
Mind if I turn on some heat?	If you can figure it out, be my guest.
Three hundred.	Fine.
Get in.  This side.	What?
Let's talk some more first.	Right.  So!  In town on business?
What do you like?	If I want you to turn me on I'll pay you three hundred.  Just lay back and let me drive.
Good morning.	You didn't wake me.  I'll be out of here in a minute.
Did you sleep well?	Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
Do you ever# enjoy it?	I like guys if that's what you're asking.  Not that I trust'm.
All right.  How much for the week?	What?
It'd cost you.	Of course.  How much?
Hello?	I thought I told you not to answer the phone.
You're upset, huh?	Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.
I still don't understand why you only bought one dress.	I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
Okay.	Good.
I thought maybe you'd like dinner.	Thank you.  I would.  Nice.
What about dinner?	Dinner can wait.
You always been rich?	No.
You still mad at'm?	He died a long time ago.
Do I look okay?	Hmm# let's see# no, there's something missing.
I've never been on a plane before.	I'm glad you like it.  Now be quiet, I've really got to read these.
If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you.	I more than liked it.
One more night and you're finally rid of me.	Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.
What else?  You gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town?	It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
What did you do to him?	What do you mean?
Aw, don't# no#	Stay with me tonight.  Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to.
What's up, where you going?	Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.
Love this car!  Is it new?	Yes!  And you don't even know where you're going!
Did I wake you?	I'm up.
I don't think there's any sense in --	Let him answer.
What!?	Have a good day, gentlemen.
You broke my nose.	I think I broke my hand.  You're fired.
Yes, I'm glad you're clean but I've been calling and calling.	Was that you?
You sure you won't come with me?	And leave all this?  Not in a million.
Couple a hours.	Yeah.  Well# I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
Yeah, what?	Rent.  You're late.
I'm just going to my room.	You're a guest here?
May I help you?	I'm just looking, thanks.
You have beautiful things.  How much is this?	I don't think it would fit you.
What is with you?	Excuse me?
Yes?	Do you remember me?
He will come for me.	Of course.
Every ship but the four you sent.	Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four.
I killed him myself.	Then why is there fear behind your eyes?
Does it bother you to hear?	Nothing you can say will upset me.
Farm Boy. Fill these with water --  --please.	As you wish.
I fear I'll never see you again.	Of course you will.
Can you move at all?	Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
But it did. I was there. This old man said, "Man and wife."	Did you say, "I do"?
I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss.	I believe you -- So what happens now?
You're quick.	And a good thing too.
Why should that make such a difference?	Well #  # you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.
Faster!	I thought I was going faster.
Give her to me.  Catch up with us quickly.	What do I do?
Hello.	It's you.
You don't look so good.  You don't smell so good either.	Perhaps not. I feel fine.
Will this do?	Where did you get that?
I brought you a special present.	What is it?
A book?	That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.
Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned. But that's not the same thing.	Because I can stop now if you want.
Now I think you ought to go to sleep.	Okay.
Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.	As you wish#
Could this be a trap?	I always think everything could be a trap -- Which is why I'm still alive.
Your guess is as good as mine --	I'll beat you both apart. I'll take you both together.
Now?	Not yet.
Now?	Light him.
No --	-- offer me money --
-- yes --	-- power too -- promise me that --
-- all that I have and more please --	-- offer me everything I ask for --
He's dead. He can't talk.	Look who knows so much. Well, it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead. There's a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Please open his mouth.
You don't know any way you'll trust me?	Nothing comes to mind.
We'll wait until you're ready.	Again. Thank you.
You are wonderful!	Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so.
Because I know something you don't know.	And what is that?
You're amazing!	I ought to be after twenty years.
There's something I ought to tell you.	Tell me.
What's so funny?	I'll tell you in a minute. First, let's drink -- me from my glass, and you from yours.
-- get back, witch --	I'm not a witch, I'm your wife. But after what you just said, I'm not even sure I want to be that anymore.
You feeling any better?	A little bit.
Help!	All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.
Yes, what?	What you were saying.  Keep talking.
Assume away!	Well, it's very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need.
Will you get a hold on yourself.	Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that better?	It's a little better, but you still look angry.
Where would you like to eat?	Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What do you think, Max?
Everybody's a big shot.  Well, Leo, are you having a good time?	I don't know.  I think so.  I feel very strange.
You can't feel it when it's in your hand, when it's in your pocket.	Max, what is it?  What are you doing?  What's happening?
It won't run a week!	Run a week?  Are you kidding?  This play has got to close in the first act.
Maybe it's not true!	No way out.  No way out.
Max, I#	What is it?
Do you need us?	Of course I need you.  It's dark in there.
We make love?	No!  No!  We don't make love.  Go to work.
Of course, the check, I had it with me all the time.	I don't know what's happening to me. I must be getting old.
We have reason to believe she came this way# might have stopped in this area#  Did she stop here?	No. No one has stopped here in weeks#
Let's all talk about Mary.	Who are you, friend?
What's your interest?	Money.
Somebody better tell me what's going on and tell me fast! I can take so much and then#	Your girl friend stole forty thousand dollars.
Why?	Must've needed it.
I'm in no mood for trouble!	What?
Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!	Now. Your sister is missing how long?
Yes.	She ain't missing so much as she's run away.
She stole some money.	A lot?
Mary had been there, one night, and had left.	With the forty thousand dollars?
Did he say anything about my sister?	Just what he told your detective.
Yes?	May I talk to you?
Is something wrong?	I want to know if my sister is here.
What should I know?	To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
What thing?	Huh?
Probably on his way back right now.	Sam, I'm going.
Stay here.	Why can't I go out there with you?
He didn't come back here?	Sam.
No, thank you. It's my problem, too.	I don't know where to start#  Except at the beginning.
I've only been here five. Right now it feels like ten, but#	All right! Then call! At least, call!
I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.	Of course we will.
I wonder so many things about her now.  Why she never told me about you#  Funny, when you think there's an answer to everything, you think you know all the answers.	We were going to get married. Are going to get married!
You going to wait here for me?	I'm going with you. But we'd better decide what we're going to say and do when we walk in#
Sorry.	Hospital clean.
You can't go up there.	Why not?
It's regular. Okay?	I could stand something regular.
Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. It's Friday anyway# and hot.	What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
You have something most girls never have.	I have?
You're very# kind.	It's all for you. I'm not hungry. Please go ahead.
You eat like a bird.	You'd know, of course.
Wait a minute!	Now what?
May I see your license?	Why?
Went out before service.	Have you two had breakfast?
I'll take you to#	Better sign in first, hasn't we?
I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I?	Yes.
My mother is not dead!	I didn't think so.
Yes.	From what?
Did you wish to see someone?	I understand my husband is-- your assistant. May I see him please?
What made you steal? Are you hungry?	No--I don't want to give any money. Everybody wants money--I'm not going to give any money.
What are you going to do?	I'm going to call the police.
You are right. But before I can get him back here, you will have to help me.	How? What can I do?
What is it now?	I'm losing my blood!
Your father?	Yes!
Did you hear?	Yes, the child #
The child!	Yes.
There's no child here, and no dogs either.	No?
You wouldn't have said that before you met her.	I'd call it stupid at any time.
We'll be coming to the opening.	At any time. You will always be welcome.
But I think these things are beautiful.	They are.  My boy, I think you are right. Everyone is tired out today and now that we have seen my doors open in a new country, I am beginning to realize that I am a little tired myself. You can call that fellow in from the front. I think we'll close for the night.
Which one is me? The horse?	Get out of here.
I am right! I know I'm right!	Well, no one would ever suspect it. You don't sound right.
You didn't happen to be going to Worth's place, did you?	No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there.
Please. I'm sorry. I'll see it through. What do you want me to do?	I told you what to do. Drive around the corner out of sight of the house. I want to get a closer look at the place.
Why?	You go in for dangerous things.
What is it? What happened?	Don't ask any questions. Come on!
I'd know him anywhere.	Don't lose sight of him. This is the most important thing in my life.
Two: what if I didn't miss?	You did.
What was her name?	Excuse me???
Could we go somewhere?	I'm heading out of town.
What?	I could go out of town.
Could you?	Where to?
I didn't want to leave things the way we did.  Not this time.	Wait.  I want to tell you something.
Why?	So I can move on.  You too.
Yes?	Is Rose here?
Lots of things. Buddy, mostly.	Buddy. Well, now, that's a nice name, I like it. I am real pleased to meet you.  Hey, look, do you think you got a cold drink of ice water somewhere?
Just for a second. Please, Rose, what's the harm?	Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
You better quit that.	But Rose#
Buddy, you wouldn't tell nobody, would you?	Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.
I hate to turn on this light, you Daddy's awake downstairs, but I have to take the chance.  Buddy, please don't tell on me.	I said I wouldn't.
Rose, you must know who the fellow is.	Well, he might be that man who followed me home from the store the other day. But I don't know who he is, Buddy, I really don't.
I gotta find out what they're saying. You lie back and rest, Rose, and I'll give you a report on it.	I don't want to know#
Hi, Buddy.  How's my sweetheart who never told on me when I was bad?	Okay.
You were up late last night, Brother.	Well, a little.
Son, was Rose in your room last night?	No. Why should Rose be in my room?
I never saw anything like it. How did she pick him up so fast?	I don't know.
Is that Doctor still up there, Brother.	Yeah, he's still up there.
Open that door, damn you!	Daddy, what's the matter?
I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose come in?	No, she hasn't.  I think I hear a car.
There goes Mother.	Yeah.
I think she's gonna kiss him.	At least.
Now I can't see. What are they doing?	Boy! Wow!
What's goin' on?	Rose says she's goin' to have a baby and she sure looks it, but I don't think so.
Why is it taking so long?	Here comes Daddy.
Why Rose? Why Rose, Daddy?	Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful day.	Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
Well, she's back.	What time is it?
Now you listen to me, Rose --	Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
Excuse me, sir, are you calling my wife a liar?	Honey, please#
How is she?	Fine.
It's twenty after one.	I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.
All right, all right. Now calm down, Rose, the children will hear you. Calm down, let's talk# about this thing, let's discuss it.	Don't make me# me# me# get up!
Rose, what are you doing up?	Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
Nothin'. I got myself up, that's all.	Got yourself up?
You were up late last night, too, Rose.	Yes, sir. I had to go to the bathroom.
I got an awful bad cold.	That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?
And who, Rose, may I ask, is that?	Well, it's Billy.
Well, Rose, going out to look for a job today?	What's the use, there ain't none.
What baby? What baby? What baby are you speaking about?	Mine.
Yes, I am.	No, you're not.
Took your time gettin' here.	She has other things to do, Dave.
I'm not goin' in there, I don't like the looks of it!	Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
Never again, never again#	I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry#
Rose has learned her lesson, haven't you, Rose?	Yes, ma'am.
You see, Rose? Now that's the kind of dress you ought to wear.	Yeah, it's kinda nice.
Rose, you don't have to.	I don't mind.
Let me tell him.  Let him decide.	You're not gonna see him again.
And# ?	What and?  That's what I got.
What do you want?  I'm clean.  I been clean a long time.	Really?  Is that a fact# ?
Hey now# what the fuck# ?	Again.
I can work this.	No you can't.
This is too fast.  This is way too fast!	Relax.
When you planning to cut back on that?	What?
They# they shot me.	They shot us all, kid.
How you doing back there?	Feeling great.
You know, the more weight back there, the faster the car goes.	Bullshit.
What the# ?!  What was that for?	Follow me.
You live like a pig.	Can't you say something nice once?
Whoa, whoa# it's gonna be alright.	# where# where's a jerk like me ever gonna find another girl to love him# huh?#
Feels like there's a bullet still in my chest.	There probably is.
He tried to kill us.	We've got the tape to prove it.
Yeah# great.	You know# you could say thank you.
Alright?	Absolutely.
We got him.	Slow down.
If they crash, maybe he'll run.  You can shoot him in the leg or something.	Let's hope.
You# SUCK!  You almost got us all killed!	You think this is so easy?
Let's get this thing done.	All for one#
You get him?	Dead.
Been waiting long?	Just got here.
Get his attention.	Your wish is my command.
You see that?	Yeah.
Hey, are you awake?	Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm not gonna see her again.
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.	It'll work. It'll work.
Shall we try and go around?	It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
What's going on?	I don't know.
I'm sorry.	Hold me.
I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.	He wasn't. I can feel it.
Yes.	All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way.
Good luck.	You, too.
Here we go again.	All right, hang on.
We're coming!	Come on! Come on!
I'm going in.	Here goes nothing.
He's my father.	Your father?
You cannot hide forever, Luke.	I will not fight you.
Told you, did he?	Yes.
You!	I'm afraid so, Brad.  But wasn't it nice?
I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here with a purpose.	I told you, my car broke down.
Yes.	Everyone knows Betty's a wonderful little cook.
Yes Brad.	I've got something to say.
You'd better sit here and keep warm while I go for help.	But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
I'm coming with you.	There's no point both of us getting wet.
Yes, the rain has been very heavy.	Yes.
Right!	We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.
Good God.	Yes.
You did right.	A decision had to be made.
Promise you won't tell Brad.	Cross my heart and hope to die.
What a guy	Makes you cry
What guy	Makes you cry
On the day I went away.	Goodbye
Feeling	Like I'm outside in the rain
I think you had better both come inside.	You're too kind.
Creature of the night.	Creature of the night.
I thought you liked them.  They liked you.	They didn't like me.  They never liked me.
Looks quiet, y'know.	I think it's closed.
But you never had a chance to prove yourself.	Absolutely.
Would ya like a glass of water?	#No thanks.
What's the matter? Ya don't like the room?	It's fine.
Y'know how I said that stuff on television didn't bother me?	Yes.
Wanna hear a dirty joke?	#Yes --
#Can't do it.	#What?
You busted?!	What?!
#That boy damn near broke my arm.	Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear?
My side.	Get that doctor.
I don't like ya face.	Don't like yours neither.
What's ya name again?	Bob.
A hundred an' thirty.	That's it, I'm broke.
Buddy's got a thing against ya, Rock. Some people just hate for no reason, y'know.	Yeah.
Y'know I won't be able to work for ya no more.	Hey -- if a good man can make a better life, let him make it.
#Screw you.	What'd you say?
Did these guys teach you to talk dirty? Huh?	Hey --
Listen, I hope ya don't --	I won't.
How old are ya?	#What?
Did ya get the message, kid?	Message -- What message?
Listen, Rock, you're a very lucky guy.	Yeah.
Really think so?	Ya got heart.
Don't you care what the people will say?	#I'm doin' it for a friend.
How am I doin'?	Real good.
Ya nose is broke.	Damn! How's it look?
Wanna keep goin'?	Would you keep goin'?
Hey, Rock -- What happened?	'Bout what?
No more, ya wanna lose an eye? No more.	Open my eyes -- Please, open my eyes!
Ya sister knows I'm comin'?	Yeah, sure -- She's very excited.
#Maybe I better forget it.	Try again, c'mon, try again.
Ya really like her?	Sure I like her.
They must've taken it off me.	They?
You?	That's right, me.
Hold on a second.	Eddie, come on.
You got the will in there, don't ya?	No, I don't.
What the hell are you doin'?	I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
Does this help?	Yeah, that's better.
I'll get it.	Get away from there.
Wrong number?	No, it's not.
If I don't make it back here by ten#	Yeah?
Nurse.	Sir. Ah, sir. Death the end of all
It's under your seat.	What?
We kept it#	Is that right?
While Sam and I take out the back two cars#	Leaving#
I drive -- and my name is Larry.  Larry from the States.	And who are you?
So what's the deal?	The deal?  The deal is we leave for Nice at first light.
And you believed me?  But it wasn't my people who did it.	How do we know that?
Problem my ass!  I think you're lying to me, and if you are you're a dead man!	Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
What in bloody hell is going on?	They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.
Lose them!	You lose them!
About time!	Not yet#
Sam.  I'm a weapons guy.	You were a soldier, were you?
I better be getting that.	Duty calls?
Where's the case?	There's a problem#
Go ahead, shoot# Shoot and kill the bitch, I don't care.  And yet you don't shoot.  Interesting. Put down your weapon and walk away.	Don't do it, Sam!
Do you have it?	Not so fast.  Who's that?
Where's my information?	In here#
We'll die if we stay here!	You'll die if you leave here.
If you're lying to me you poor excuse for a human being, I'm gonna blow your brains all over this car.	I swear, it has to come here!  It has to#
This better be the real thing or you're a dead man!	It is, I'm telling you it is!!
Is it done?	It's done.
What are you doing?	Don't cross me#
He's tough, your American friend.	Yes, Sam's tough alright.
Some, thanks.  Enough to move on, for now.	You should really let a doctor look at that.
So what is it you want to know?	I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
You shoot alright.	Gets the job done.
Yeah, well#  My way works too.	My way is better.
What are you gonna do, call him up and ask him to give us back our shit?	Did he bring that with him?
What're you talking about, man?  I don't understand.	What a surprise#
Sorry I'm late#	What makes you think we're here to meet you?
Perhaps the police?	I know cops -- and you're no cop.
Cigarette?	No thanks.
Where to?	To see a man about a thing.
Pretty much what you'd expect.	That's what I thought.
What'd you say to him?	I asked if we could give him anything else.
Help yourself.  Since when do you smoke?	I have, I don't know, maybe a cigarette a week.
Lovely, isn't it?	They'd have to keep something like this under lock and key in New York, and it would still get fucked up.
What's going on?	I just wanted to see something.
How did you know?	Know what?
It was at that.	A lot of people died.
You're a cop#you're a fucking cop#I should kill you.	But you can't.
Alright, it's done.	You see the bullet?
You know him?	I know of him.
You sure your friend got the right place?	If Tony says this is it, then it's it.
Tell me, Sam: why do you do this?	Do what?
What the fuck happened?	I don't know#
Give me a cigarette.	Right now?
I'm not here very much.	Business keeps you on the road?
I know I don't need to say this to you, but I need to say it to you.  This is my job, I have to do it.	So I do it.
Time to quit.	Just like that?
You have to stop doing that!	I'll work on it#
Let's get him out of here#	Finish the job#
Why didn't you kill her?	Why didn't you kill him?
My man, how you doing?	I'm alright.  And you?
Do you have the tape?	I might know where you could get a copy.
Can you get it?	The Russian would be easier.
What the hell happened here?	Looks like some kind of drug deal or something, they're not from around here --  one of them's still alive.
Ready to roll, partner?	Sure thing, and --
Ten thousand right here.	There must be over a million dollars in here.
What are we going to do?	What do you mean what are we going to do?
Call it in I guess.  Why?	Why?  Are you kidding me?
No.  We can't.	Look around you partner!  You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
It won't work.	Why?
All right hold on!  Lemme think#  Shit, did you touch the car?	Maybe.  Who cares?
I've got one condition.	What's that?
Shhh!	What are you gonna do?
I don't know!  Son of a bitch! Who the hell are you?	He saw everything!
I don't know#	You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one#
We're dead.  We're dead, We are dead#  What are we going to do?!	I don't know#
I could kill that no good son of a bitch!	All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!
He's going to be trouble.	He's a partner now, Earl, like it or not.
You said that last time!	Well I mean it this time.  Come on.  Let's get this over with!
How long is it going to take?!	I don't know!  Shit, give me a break!
Here it is.	There it is#now what about the others?
Even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up!	You killed him#
Jesus Christ Earl#what are we doing?#	We're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!
Oh Jesus#	He killed her#he killed her#
It's too late#	It's NOT too late!
I was beginning to think you weren't going to show.  That can't be all of it.	No.  It's not.
You don't expect us to believe that do you?	You better believe it if you know what's good for you!
How are ya?	Hello.
Well, we have one lead and that's what I'm looking into next.	What's that?
Ah hell, he'd do the same for me.	Has he?
Get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours#	I might have to look into that#
Hi.	Hi.
What's wrong?	Nothing.
Like hell it's over.  You told me he wasn't doing this anymore.	He's not, he's#
Let's not get into this again. I know him.  If you said something, he'd take it out on me.	And I'd take it out on him.
How are we going to do all this?	I'm going to quit.  That's what has to happen first.  Then we're going to tell him.
Why does that bother you?	I'm not sure why.  It's just, I've never been anywhere else#
Do you wanna tell me what that was all about?	Yeah.  I want to tell you everything.
Yeah, I've seen him.	What did he buy?
I have a better plan.  You want to hear it?	What?
And what's that?	How about you give us what you have and leave.
I don't know.	This just might be our ticket!
I guess we can get started.	I wanted to ask you some questions about last night.
Uh, no#	Don't you think I would have told you that!
Maybe.  Maybe not.	What are you getting at?
Hello.	Hi.
Anything I can help you with?	Well I just uh, you know#
Aw, now that gonna take time to clear!	Take it or leave it.
Do you even have a girlfriend, Jesse?	Sort of.
Nice of you to join us.  I did say three o'clock, didn't I?	Well I'm here now.
What's this?	I don't know#
Suppose I'm not exciting enough for you.	I didn't say that.  You did.
Don't you want to hear about my day?	Yeah let's hear about your day.
Whatever#	Look I worked all day, I'm tired as hell and I want to sit and eat in peace!  Is that asking too much?
We're out of here.	Right behind you.
I'm not asking.	Well you're not getting, either.
Don't hurt me.	We gotta, Jesse.  It's tough, but you didn't leave us any choice.  We gotta know where the tapes are.
Hi ma.	Hi.
I didn't know you were coming.	I was in the neighborhood.
This whole place?	Yeah.  Figured you could have it.
Don't you want it?	Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.
You want to hear the good news first, or the bad news?	Give me the bad news.
But nowhere near three million dollars worth.  I would say maybe twenty thousand.	There was more than that.
He didn't make it into work, and he's not home.	I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!
Yeah.	What do you think?  Heart attack?
This isn't right#	I'm not getting an answer.
I'm busy at the moment.	I said get on your feet!
Let's go.  I've got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me.	I don't think so#
Would you like me to tell you how your father died?	Lee, you okay?
Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?	C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You won, now just put the gun down.
Oh, you American?	That's right.
Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that one.	Oh yes, she's very nice.
You lied to me.	I'm sorry.
Hello.	How you doin'?
What are you doing?	She said I could pick any girl I want.
Goddamn you got a small ass.	Don't look at my ass!
Carter?	Who died?
So are you getting on the plane or not?!	What?
It sounds impossible --	You said --
You want to figure out why they killed your Daddy, get on the plane.	Why LA?
She's just standing around -- not doing much.	Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
Slow down, baby.	What did you say?
Pick it up!	It's your turn!
Wait!  There's people down there!	There's people up here!
I wouldn't do that!!!	It's a bomb.
Are you okay?	What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody.  How could you fall for that shit?  I knew she was dirty.
As long as you're asking#I think you have a pretty good voice.	I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
Let's go.	Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out.
Carter#here comes the rich white man.	Wait here.  I'll handle this.
Lee, what the hell are you doing?	Dancing?
Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth?	I did!
Lee, wait a second.  It's not worth it, man.  He's making you do this.	It's worth it to me.
We made it, man.	No problem.
They owe us, man.  That's the least they can do.	This money is evidence.
I know who you are, Inspector Lee.	Then you know I'm not walking away from this case.
Put your arms around me.	Excuse me?
What's going on?	I need your help.
You move well.	Just trying to make it look real.
I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?	No.  But I'll help you.
Are you okay?	I'm fine.
I didn't know which side you were on.	Now you know.
If you reach for that gun, I'm going to kill you.	Don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
Who the hell is that?	That is#Chief Inspector Lee.  The detective in charge of our investigation.
What is your name?	That's cool.  We're gettin' to know each other. This is a good thing. I'm Carter.
You have one of these?	No.
You speak English!	A little.
-- what the hell is that?	What?
You talk too fast.	Come on!
Let's go.  Everybody take off?	Took off. Yes. They took off.
You like it?	Yeah, it's good.
Now, that's American music.	Yes, I know this song.
That's not how it goes.	Yes, I think so.
What?!	It's him.
Which one?	Going into the restaurant.
Like that.	I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women.
No, wait.  I don't have it.  You have it.	Oh yes.
I'm sorry, Lee.	Be sorry for Soon Young. She has no chance now.
What are you doing here?	Well, I ain't goin' to China.  And neither are you.
Oh no.	What?
Not anymore.	Where'd you get it?
Way he put it, I was the only one he thought could handle it. But you know what the worst thing is?	No#what?
How'd what go?	With the FBI. What do you think I'm talking about?
Oh my god#what happened to you?	It's called a dress.
Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.	What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
You OK?	We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?
How about a lift home?	Absolutely. I'll even let you ride in the front seat.
My daughter.	She's fine.
Yes.	You have what I asked for?
Come on. Let's get you some dry clothes.	Carter, can I have a moment?
When were you going to tell me you were not going with us?	I still have work to do here.
Yes.	Let me take you back inside, okay?
What do you expect me to say to this?	How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?
You look awful.	Thank you.
I'll get the dress.	He's here!# He's here!
I love his eyes.  I just believe they're listening to you.	His hair# any color.
Is that what I did to you?  Is that what happened?  Did I just not see you?	No.  No, you didn't.
Look, he's running after her.	Look, he's in pretty good shape.
Look -- I'll be in there later today. I'll come by and tell you all about it.	You're coming here?
Of course we are.  Of course.	Then you'll be my best man.
I have no idea what I'm doing.	Your job is# the ring.  Do you have the ring?!
I think you'd look good in red.	No, she's talking about your hair.
Weird dreams?  You're going to tell me about them?	Yes.
You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?	You can turn that finger around.
Always a mood killer.	Still sweet.
I don't know.	You don't know.
Even with everything that's happened I've still never been married and I still deserve a beautiful dress.	Agreed.
I'll have the same.	Of course.
I don't know, give me a minute.  Are you all right with this?	Excuse me?
About a minute#?	A little longer for me.
I love you.  I love you.	I love you, too.
To who?  Are you asking me?	Me?
Yes, you!	Well, you do have the dress.
Used?	They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
I'm going to kill myself.	Why?
What?	Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
There's no why, Annie.  I'm just not up for it.  I never said I was.	Is there somebody else?
They loved you.  I told you they would love you and they did.	I love you.
Happy New Year, darling.	Happy New Year.
Couldn't you just do a phone interview?	Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
Walter.	It was my mother's.
Beautiful view, isn't it?	Walter, there's something I have to tell you --
Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve you.	I think that's what I'm saying.
Oh!	What?
You should write something about this.	About what?
What was that about up there?	What was what?
Men never get this movie.	I know.
Hello.	Turn on your radio!
I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.	You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
Did you talk to him?	I couldn't do it.  How did I get here?
You told a lie and got on a plane.	That's not what I mean.  I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him.  I am.
You were standing in the middle of the street?	You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
It's a sign --	It's a sign I've watched this movie too many times.  I'm so stupid.  From the minute I listen to that stupid program on the radio, I've been a complete jerk.
You don't know who she was, Annie --	I saw her.  She looked just like this --
You're going to miss the train.	No, I'm not. 
I need to know about him because# he's involved with my sister#	Okay.
Honey, he wasn't right for you.	I know.
Are you Annie?	Yes.
It's probably just the flowers --	We'll move them --
So you'll get married in a new dress.	It's a sign.
Sure you do.	Sure you do --
You touch her for the first time, and suddenly# you're home.  It's almost like#	Magic.
Hello.	Hello.
It's you.	It's me?
I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'm not mad at you.	I think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this. Maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better.
Do you think there's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife? Maybe even more?	It's hard to imagine.
What are you going to do, Sam?	I don't know.  When I met my wife, it was so clear.  I just knew.
You don't like the one he was now?	He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
No.	Why not?
Is he home right now?	Yeah.
Write her.	You think so?
This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life.	I don't get it.
Dad --	What is it?
Dad?  About last night?	It's never happening again. Right?
Not.	My feelings exactly.
Fine.  Fine.	So I can go.
How did they get our phone number?	You have to give them your phone number or they won't let you go on the air.
If you get a new wife, I guess you'll have sex with her, huh?	What do you think?
I# uh# have a date with someone Friday night.	Good.
Why is she bringing that bag?	She's going to cook something for us?
Did you call that radio station again?	No.
What if I couldn't get to you?	I was scared of what you were gonna do.
Maybe we'll get a dog when we get back.	Okay.
Sure.  I'd really like that. Thank you so much.	Well#
Hi.	Hi.  Sam?
You saw her in the airport and then here?	I tried to talk to her#  It was like I knew her.  Weird.
Hi.	Hi.
You look good.	You look good yourself.
I thought you were never going to call me.	You did?
He's ten.	He's good at it.
Take a drink. Calm down!	I say we gotta take action. Now.
Where you going?	Got to talk to the brothers.
This water's cold again.	I'm sorry. The fire's gone out.
Stop it! The children are watching. Stop it!	Never# never# never!
What's the matter?	It's nothing. Just a little catch #
What were they saying? About you? In there?	They say I am no good to you.
Let them take it!	Over my dead body.
You all right?	Sure.
Must've been some experience for you, huh?	Yes.
How do you feel?	I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
But if you go back they'll lock you up again.	No, no # the Sheriff had enough of us. We drove him crazy.
We've got to have a talk, you and me.	All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
Tell me.	We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.
This is what we've been waiting for.	What are you saying?
Why didn't you support her? You're the worst of the lot.	But honey #
What are you doing here?  Something wrong with Mama?	I thought maybe you forgot#
No, I don't mind.  That's how come I told you about it.	I was talking to my wife.
Bobby?	Shhh.
What is it?	Nothing, I'm trying to remember#
I wanna do a small buy first.  Ten thousand.  We'll see how it goes.	Why? The guys is ready to deal now.
Yeah.	Everything go?
Look#I'd like to help you out # but I really don't want to get involved.	I understand. Thanks anyway.
What about the guy on the very bottom?	Leave me out of this.
What?	Nothing.
Why don't you call the cops?	Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
Then make sure he gets put away for longer.	How?
Oh. Hi.	What happened to your eye?
Is that how you play?	I try.
: What are you up to?	Nothing.
You think you're the only one down here with a sad story?	No. But I'm the only one with my sad story.  And that's how it's gonna stay.
Who is it?	It's me.
Why not?	I just can't. Okay?
No. I want to know what the hell is going on.	I can't tell you.
No, you're wrong, I tried to tell myself the same thing but I could have gotten up. I could have done something.	They would have killed you too.
Really, I don't want to.	I want to do this for you.  I want to do something good for a change.
Will you do that?  Then I want you to get out of the room.	Why?
You're good, princess. I'll give you that.	Danny, it's not what you think.
Oh shit	What?
Who is it?	It's Tom.
What time is it?	Twelve
Where to?	I know a guy.
Nice day	I hadn't noticed.  I've seen you around.  What's your name?
A quarter?  Danny that ain't even worth #	A quarter of a million, Jimmy.
You know, Jimmy, you might as well put a sign on the back of this thing asking the cops to pull you over.	You mean, like to throw 'em off?
You want a hit?	No. I'm good.
Can I ask you something?	Sure, Jimmy.
Danny?	Yes, Jimmy.
Okay	Wait till I tell you what it is.
Why?	You're my best friend, man. I'd do anything for you.
Jimmy, look, there's something I have to tell you.	Hey, check it out#
But#I've seen you.	When? When did you ever see me use?
I don't know# a little. I wish you would have let me in on it from the beginning.	I'm sorry. I couldn't.
Then why don't I see any pictures Of me up there?	That was my idea.
You don't understand.	Understand what?
I'm sorry.  Would you like a taste?	No, I'm good.
Can we talk price?	Make me an offer.
You're serious?	Anything for a dear friend.
Maybe you're the one who isn't taking me seriously.	Why do you say that?
You want to do this some other time?	Pull your pants down.
Come on, guys #	Big Bill.
Shoot him.	Okay! Okay!
Now get talkin'	I didn't fucking do anything! I swear to God!
CAN I PULL MY FUCKING DICK OUT?!	Yeah.
I ought to just call this whole thing off right now.	Don't do that. Please.  Or I'll kill you.  Please, Danny.
I've got a hot one.	You go, boy.
I was getting to it.	Tell me what?
What the hell are you doing here?	Question is, what are you doing here?
What? Is it bad?	I'm afraid so, Danny.
Danny?	My name is Tom.
Please # don't do this #	Answer the fucking question!
We know what's going on.	I still don't know what you're talking about.
Jimmy?	Who the hell is Jimmy?
What's that smell?	That would be me.
You think that's a good idea?	What do you mean?
You thinking what I'm thinking?	Yeah.  This could be the one we're looking for.
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.	Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
Good luck, John.	Thank you, sir.
Yes, sir.	Of course, sir.
He ain't Wade.	Nope, he ain't Wade.
Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.	I'd love to hear it.
Watching.	Gives Wade the second shot.
Not yet.	Keep trying.
Sir, I'm sorry about what happened, I#	It was nothing.
I wasn't made for this.	You think the rest of us were?
What is it?	A machine gun.
Good luck, Captain.	Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
I wonder where they're going.	Same place we are.
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.	You don't count.
Captain, what about our deal?	I changed my mind.
CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO THAT, SHE'D BE VERY UPSET!	I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER.
Worked, didn't it?	You tryin' to get yourself killed?
Uh, Captain#	PUSH!
I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.	Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.
Makes you feel small, doesn't it?	It doesn't take this.
How about#?	How about you shut up and take your position?
You alright?	Let's just find someplace.
Sir, I've got an idea, let's go around.	We can't leave it here.
Up.  We're moving out.	I thought you said we had an hour, sir?
I've given this a lot of thought, sir.  The best thing that could happen is, we find Ryan and he's dead.	Why's that?
Looks like they've been having a hell of a party, here, Captain.	ON THE BRIDGE!  WE'RE COMING IN.
I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.  HERE WE COME.  Cover me.	What if our guys open up, sir?
Thank you, sir.	Yeah, yeah.  I want you right next to me, no matter where I go, you understand?
Yes, sir.	Alright, come with me.
I'd like to go, sir.	No, private, I want you to stay here, keep your head down, don't do anything brave or stupid.
Damn fool.  Sir.	Captain, he's fast!
So, where are you from?	Get lost.
You think he really believed it?	Who knows?  It worked.
Hi.	Is it a gift for your wife?  Are you getting a set together? 
Thanks, I like yours too.	Listen, I don't know your name, but what are you doing for lunch?
I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.	Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
Keep it.	You're sure?
Why do you eat that stuff?  There's no food in your food.  Not too loud, the red line's there for a reason.	How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?
No, no, don't go in there.	Forget it, forget it, it's mine, it's mine!
Then what's love?	I'm gonna call her.
Look at those eyes.	Lloyd, give it up.
Wait for me for when I get round to the front. 	Okay, I got it.
You are such a great person Lloyd.  I'm a good person, but you are a great person.	Hang in there, man.
Did you sleep with her?	I admit nothing.
Alright.	Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.
What does it say?	Read it.
No, you're not a guy.	I am.
I told him to be himself.	He's got that nervous talking thing.  I told him not to speak.
Wait a minute.	You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe#
Visit her at the home.	I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.
Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years# I might cut that part out.	Why?  It's fine.  It's nice.
God, that's# this is ridiculous.	Now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that I kept. Now it's yours.  Go ahead, open it.
What?	I just had a phone call.
God, I'll have to go on a plane.	We'll worry about that later.  Now come on, tell me that you're special.
Morning honey.	Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
Goodnight.	Goodnight.
Morning.	Dad, I'm sorry.
Lloyd?	Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
Did he ever get rough with you?	Dad, no.  But I didn't want any problems, so I decided not to sleep with him.
Dad, maybe I shouldn't go with all that's happening to you.	You're going.
Do you love him?	I like him a lot.
If I pick it up, we'll only get back together.	Well then don't pick it up. You know what's best.
What happened to you?	Dad, did you do it?  Did you take that money?
Hello.	Hi.
Actually, I think that I#	Y'know, you're not in England yet, you know that of course, and by the way, I want to just tell you that I lived in England for a few months,
Whoa.	Would you hold this for me?
So we can finally talk?	Yeah.
Have a good sleep.	Bye.
Alright, this is some of the things they wrote me; "Glad I finally met you", "You always seemed nice", "Wish I could have known you more"#	Mine say stuff like "Lloyd, see you around maybe"
It's just you and your dad, right?	Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.
Yeah.	Or, or I could always wear this one.
Nice one.	Yeah?
After work?	I usually have a break after the dinner service, if you want to stop by.
Stop by later.	Okay, bye, I will.
Yes.	What did you say?
Let's get outta here.  You want to?	Yeah.
I think that we should spend some time apart.	What's wrong?
Okay, what did we just decide?	We decided#
What do you want?	I'm sorry.
How's it going?	Nobody thought we'd do this.  Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
Okay, I'll give here the message.	Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?
Thanks Lloyd.	How do you pay for one of those?
She wouldn't get out of the car.  I brought her all the way here, she said she was going to come here, and she wouldn't get out of the car.  But I thought that is was important, that she come to see you, because I know that if you go somewhere and you don't deal with your family stuff, then you're just gonna, she's gonna, um#	Are you going to England with her Lloyd?
My car.	Your car?
Lloyd, everybody in that party put something down on their record except you.	How many people really know what they want though?  I mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? But inside, they don't really know, so, I don't know.  But I know that I don't know.
Oh boy.	Hey.
Oh, I was just going to#	A very responsible young man you're out with tonight.
I love you man	I love you too.
What's your name?	Sir, the list is correct.
Luck.	War.
Should I stay?	It's a beautiful city.
Should I stay?	It's up to you.
We started without you.	Good.
I go to work the other day, there's nobody there.  Nobody tells me about this, I have to find out, I have to go in, everybody's gone -	They're not gone, they're here.
I tried to call you, I'm running a little late, this is taking longer than I thought.  Have a drink.	What's going on?
You want these people.	These people, my people, I want my people.
If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually.  But how?	I just told you.
What's that?	You don't recognize it?  Maybe that's because it's not what I asked for.
I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work.	You're welcome, I'm sure you're doing a great job.
How you feeling, all right?	Yeah.
What's wrong with it?	How should I know?  It's broken. See what you can do.
Good.  How's it going?	Things are great, things are great.
What are you doing?	I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
Thank you.	I need a drink.
I don't know anybody who'd be interested in that.	They should be.
I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's till hot.  We're doing well?	Yes.
Don't ever do that to me again.	Do what?
This, I don't know, maybe you can trade it for something.	Thank you.
You think I don't know what you're doing? You're so quiet all the time?  I know.	Are you losing money?
I'll talk to him.	I think it's too late.
Four hundred, four fifty -	More.
I know what you're saying, but I don't see the difference.	You don't?  I do.  I see a difference.
I'll talk to you later.	No, no, what, what is it?
What's he done that's so bad - take money? That's a crime?  Come on, what are we here for, to fight a war?  We're here to make money, all of us.	There's taking money and there's taking money, you know that.  He's taking money.
That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there.	I won't.
Shit.	What is it?
Outside.	That's smart.
Don't do that. Hang up#call#	What? I can't hear you#
Yes.	Who is this?
Oh, I'm sorry. My bad.  I thought you were someone else.	That's okay.
Hello? Ted?	No, it's me.
Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?	I live here.
I just thought if I saw you face to face, maybe it would help.	Did it?
What are you going to do?	Finish what my son started.
Lemme take you home.	I'll get my jacket.
This is exactly what I don't want.	I think it's out of your control.
Not good. How you doin?	Not good.
You broke my heart.	What are we looking for?
This is all too familiar.	Over here.
Maybe they never got here. He could have taken her anywhere.	C'mon. Let's go.
Let's go.	No, wait here.
Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll find you later, okay.	Whatever.
Who is this?	I'll give you one guess.
Who are you?	That's not the way we play the game.
What do you want?	You're pretty when you're angry.
Where are you?	I'm everywhere.
What do you want from me?	It's what you want from me.
What do you mean?	You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.
What?	Oh my God.
Someone trying to kill me. I need the police.	Are you in danger now?
I got a surprise for you.	What?
"If I should stay. I would only be in your way. So I'll go. And yet, I know, I'll think of you each step of the way#	Don't do this.
You're going to get it. You know what happens.	But I love you. And I want the whole world to know it.
Knock yourself out.	Hello?  Hello?
Time to change numbers again?	Nah#I think it'll die off. It's opening weekend. Let's see how it goes.
That was good.	Yeah, right.
I've been waiting for you, baby.	Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?
And white.	Easy black boy.
Take it off.	But#
You ass.	I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.
I'll be right back.	Where you going?
Jesus.  Hello?	Hello.
Well what number are you trying to reach?	I don't know.
Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?	More of a game really.
You're not playing by the rules Ben. Don't you want her to live?	I swear to God if you lay one hand on her!
Where are you?	Closer than you think.
Are you sure?	Absolutely.
Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.	The killer called her.
Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened? I got a call on my cell from home. They told me that someone was attacked.	And what made you think it was Sidney?
I can see nothing's changed.	No.
Yeah?	Help me Sid! The killer's got me!
I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys later.	Do you want us to come with you?
Would you excuse me for a moment?	Sure.
Who's phone?	Oh shit it's my cell!
God damn it you two! Run! Hurry! He's dead!	No! He's not dead! He's still breathing! Look!
Answer the question. You knew Sidney's mom?	Who?
What'd he say?	Oh, you know, the usual small talk, "What's new, how ya been, how do you want to die?"
You're dead!	I don't want them, I want you!  It's simple. You show yourself, they survive, you run, they die!
Where?	She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
I didn't kill anybody.	No one's saying you did.
You ready to party hard tonight?	You know it.
Dude. What are you doing here?	I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
Ready?	Yeah#
It's on the table.	No, it's not.
I thought she was dead.	She looked dead. Still does.
Billy? What the#	I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
Close call.	What are you doing here?
You know what my dad will do to you?	I'm going# I'm going.
Oh Billy# Please# God#	I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay#
Jesus, SHIT!	Hey, hey, it's just me.
No# I don't# it's just# Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.	The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
You heard me.	Are you serious?
Who did you call?	What?
I thought you were#	I'm alright. Gotta# get# help.
NO! Don't believe him.	It's okay. Give me the gun.
It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!	Fuck you.
Jesus# fuck, that hurt.	Stop it!
Hello?	Are you alone in the house?
Yes.	Who is this?
What?	I want to talk to you for a second.
Hello.	Why don't you want to talk to me?
I don't know.	You have to have a favorite.
Why do you want to know my name?	Because I want to know who I'm looking at.
What did you say?	I want to now who I'm talking to.
I have to go now.	Wait# I thought we were gonna go out.
Yes?	I told you not to hang up on me.
Is this some kind of a joke?	More of a game, really.
I'm two seconds from calling the police.	They'd never make it in time.
Look, enough is enough. You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else.	Or else what?
My boyfriend will be here any second and he'll be pissed when I tell him#	I thought you didn't have a boyfriend.
I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll be here any second and your ass better be gone.	Sure#
Where are you?	Guess.
Please don't hurt him.	That all depends on you.
I wanna play a game.	No#
What kind of game?	Turn off the light.
Please don't do this#	Come on. It'll be fun.
I don't know#	Come on, yes you do.
What's his name?	I can't think.
I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.	No it's not. It was Jason.
#leave me alone# please#	Answer the question and I will.
What door am I at?	What?
Don't make me# I can't# I won't.	Your call.
And why is that? Has something happened?	You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
If you'll excuse me, ma'am.	Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
What are you doing here?	Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
What is she doing here?	She's with me. I just wanted to check on things.
You gonna be able to come down to the station and talk to us a bit?	#yeah#
Any word on my Dad?	Not yet, but we're looking. If you need anything#
You girls ready.	Yeah.
Have they found my father?	Afraid not.
Where is she?	Call the police.
Where is she?	I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her.
How's the book?	It'll be out later this year.
I'll look for it.	I'll send you a copy.
I'm not here to fight.	Just stay back.
Please. You owe me.	I owe you shit.
She was never attacked. I think she made it all up.	Why would she lie about it?
So where are you?	Right here.
Can you see me right now?	Uh-huh.
Hello?	Hello Sidney.
Are you okay?	Can you knock?
Stop. Right there.	Don't shoot. It's me.
Come on, Sid. Give me the gun.	No, Sid.
Why are they doing this?	Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
Remember, there's safety in numbers.	Yeah, okay# whatever.
Do you believe this shit?	What happened?
Practice ran late. I'm on my way.	It's past seven.
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.	Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
Take a message.	It's alright. I'll get it.
Just relax. You're at school now. No one can get you here.	But if it wasn't Billy it could be anybody. He could be here at school right now.
This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.	I want you to meet me here right after class, okay?
Shit, what is he doing here?	I bet he's pissed.
This could be good. What do you think, Sid?	I don't know#
Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you?	Oh, god#
Hunt? Why would they ask if you like to hunt?	I don't know, they just did.
That's not necessary.  You're in.	Thank you.
You don't.  It goes to court now.	He wouldn't just turn himself in.  It doesn't make any sense.
What do you think?	I'm in.
Have you heard?	No, I haven't heard.
Come on.  What are you going to do with yourself out there?	I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
They're hoping you stop and say goodbye before you go, but I told them not to expect it.	It would be too hard.
I guess# decide for yourself.  I don't know what it says.  I'm going to go.	I'll see you.
And# and# and he said# he asked me if I was married.  And, I could see he had a gun in his hand.	Where was the girl?
Jesus Christ, man, don't shoot me!	Turn around.  Hands on your head!
This guy paid me five hundred bucks to bring it out here.  He wanted it here at exactly seven o'clock.	Put it down.  Put it on the ground.
I don't believe it.	Hello.
What do you mean?	I mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself?
What's so exciting?	It's not too far away now.
What time is it?	Why?
Give me the gun.	Her pretty head.
You didn't know.	NO!
I wish I could have been a normal man like you.  I wish I could have a simple life.	What the fuck is going on here?!
You've made a good life for yourself#	Shut up!
Here he comes.	What the fuck is going on?
Who said this was murder?	No one yet.
You've seen my files, right?  Seen the things I've done?	No.
Is that clear?	Okay# sure#  It's just that, with my old partner, you know#
It's too soon for him.	Can we talk about this in private?
It's my wife.	What?
You go to movies at least?	I read.  Remember reading?
This is the one thing.	I know.
Nothing.	It's got to be.
What?	Bear with me.
Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding?!	Just wait!
He just may be nuts enough.	It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop.
Does this make it with you?	Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
How much money do you have?	I don't know# like fifty.
Well, that was money well spent.	Let's go.
Are you alright?	I'm fine.
Wait# just wait.	It was him.
Think about it#	What the fuck is wrong with you?
What are you talking about?	We had him.
We could use about fifty more men here.	I'm trying, alright?  Just tell me what we've got.
You knew I'd say yes.	No, actually, I wasn't sure at all.
As soon as this is over, I'm gone.	Big surprise.
Stay with him.	Wait!
Throw your gun down now!	What are you talking about?  What happened?
Throw your weapon, detective!  Now!	What did you say?
Tell me it's not true.	I can't let you do this#
Put your gun down!!	Don't do this# please#
I need you to look at each one carefully# very carefully.  Look for anything that seems strange or out of place.  Anything at all.	I don't know why# why now?
Anything# anything missing or different.	I don't see anything.
It's nice to meet you.  My husband has told me a lot about you# except your first name.	Oh# um, William.
It smells good.	What?  Oh, yes.  I mean, thank you.  Please, sit down.
Don't worry.  I don't wear it at the dinner table.	No matter how often I see guns, I still can't get used to them.
How long have you lived here?	Too long.  What do you think so far?
I don't know, with this case.	If you can, please call me.  Please.  I have to go now# goodnight.
I mean, you known this city.  You've been here for so long.	It's a hard place.
I feel strange being here with you# without David knowing.	I'm sorry, I only#
Did their son see it happen?	I don't know.
How's California?	How should I know?
Let's get along#	Why don't you finish the job?
It's all right#Charlie, let's move outside.	I ain't wearing no gun.
Is this in the line of duty, sergeant?	No sir#pleasure.
You all right, sergeant?	Dunno#Seems so.
You got any more orders, Captain?	Just keep goin'#
Martin! Ride me as far as the well!	Grab hold!#
I don't care what they've done to you#what happened#	They have done#nothing#They are my people#
Don't forget to come back with my thousand dollars.	Ain't yours yet.
What you goin' to do?	Get some sleep#Tomorrow's another day#
Go on! Get out of here while you can#	Over there!
They'll be back#	We won't be here#Come on!
What's that got to do with us?	What's goin' on?
She's not a little girl any more.	You've seen her!#She's alive?
Oh, all right! Well#Martin says#	From the beginning#
Why else?	Come on, say it.  You know#
Stop that!	You'll never get away from me!
What kind of a horrible thing is that?	It still worked in town.
Is everything alright?  Aren't you feeling well?	I just had a really strange experience.
I have a funny feeling.  Do you think we'll get over all that's happened?	We just have to make a new beginning.
Now, what did I do to deserve this?	Come on, at least try one.  It took me two hours to make these.
So, did you sleep good?	Yeah# I have to go to town.
It's just a feeling.  Don't you sense it, too?	What? What am I supposed to sense?
What?	Look at this!  The dog!  She's dead!
Oh, Ellen.  My sweet Ellen# Of course I knew.	We loved each other once.  Have you forgotten that?
How did you get me out of there?	I wouldn't have made it by myself.
For God's sake, what happened to me?	You don't remember?
Oh, Ellen!  I've been wondering when you'd come.  Why don't you step in.	Thank you.
Hello.  Can I help you?	Does this dog here belong to you?
I guess it's too lonely for most folks.  It's time for me to get going. It's been a pleasure meeting you.	Wait, won't you join me for a cup of coffee?
Do yourself a favor:  Don't ask.	I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house.  I need to know what happened in there.
You didn't tell her!	We should leave the past alone.
Thank you, my lady!	Lady?
Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome.	Who is that?
I have a wonderful new play!	Put his feet in.
Where is the play?	Oh, it's coming, it's coming.
Is it going well?	Very well.
Do you know it?	Every word.
Cut round him for now.	What? Who?
We are lost.	No, it will turn out well.
Another little problem.	What do we do now?
"Out."	"Of love?"
Be good to her, my lord!	I will.
Your Majesty.	Stand up straight, girl.
My lady!	Who is there?
Oh my lady, my love!	If they find you here they will kill you.
Can you love a fool?	Can you love a player?
I would not have thought it. There is something better than a play.	There is.
Oh, do not go	I must. I must
You cannot! Not for the Queen herself!	What will you have me do? Marry you instead?
You look sad, my lady! Let me take you riding.	It is not my riding day, my lord.
Take off your hat.	My hat?
Yes, sir.	Do you understand me?
I am very sorry, sir, I have not seen Act Two.	Of course you have not! I have not written it!
Is there a man?	A man, my lord?
What do you think?	About what?
He made it clear.	Why, thank you, David.
No.	Think about it.
He's still here.	He couldn't get his car started.
Finished.	But not quite.
Don't you worry about that.	Is this necessary?
That was good.	Can we talk about something?
What's the problem?	I want to talk now.
How much did you pay?	I don't know.
What is this?	Security.
What? Yes, that's fine.	You're sure? There's lots more.
You looking for me?	Looking for you? Yes.
Who?	Your friends.
Well, is it?	What?
That's it, then.	That's all?
Right.	Tell you what. If you do remember seeing any of these guys, maybe you could give me a phone, on this number, any time you like.
That's right.	What?
What?	Nothing. We thought you were someone else.
Did you know --	Just serve.
I'm not usually drunk.	Not usually this drunk.
I wonder how he did it?	Did what?
Alex.	What? What's wrong?
No, Alex. It's, it's --	What?
Who's going to do it?	I thought we all were.
Hello. Hello.	Who was it?
Will you calm down.	Yeah, you're making us all nervous.
Is this the same stuff you made last week?	No, no, it's different.
Leave him alone.	He can't stay up there.
Boy, am I glad to see you.	What are you doing here?
Later. But first -- him.	David?
Expecting anyone?	No.
Aren't you going to answer it?	Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.
You'll wait in the hall?	I'll wait there.
Are you all right?	Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I be?
It makes us feel a whole lot better.	That's what I thought he said.
It's about me and David.	The perfect couple, I should say.
Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.	Let him go. Let him take it all.
Interesting.	I see.
So, uh#	What?
It's OK. There's no problem.	You mean I can have the room?
Can you afford this place?	Yeah.
Two?	Who said there were four?
I see.	I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
No, I've never seen them.	You're sure of that.
Why do you want a room here?	Do you smoke?
Is this what they always look like?	Yes.
I've never seen a dead body before.	Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
Are you all right?	Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
Do you know many of these people?	Yes. They're my friends.
Two hundred.	Two hundred pounds?
Expecting anyone?	What?
I thought you'd gone to work.	With a face like this?
I'm sorry.	I should hope so.
We already know. All about it.	It was on the television.
So let's go.	You and me?
Yes.	And you need your sleep.
But I bet you didn't say you were going to split on him.	It wasn't like that.
What do we do here, David?	Sorry?
Hello.	What happened to that guy?
What guy that died?	That one, last week.
It's nice.	Would you like to see the rest?
Shall I answer it?	No, just leave it. He knows I must be at home. I'm working nights this week.
Working nights?	I'm a doctor.
Take all the time you like, doctor.	I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
Your watch.	Is it real?
Anyway, you remember Harold?	Yeah, baby, how's it going?
Don't you think there's too much gold?	It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on#
I thought you were in a good mood.	I am# except I've gotta do somebody at their house.
We cannot go into this later.	That's okay too.
-- is that right?	-- yes, we're all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in, believe it or not.
Whoever she is, she doesn't give up, does she?	No.
What're you looking for?	My keys.
Thanks a lot.	Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
You're late, George.	I gotta talk to you.
I don't care about that girl, I don't care if she's dead.	Calm down, baby.
-- I like myself far too much, far too much.	I don't want to place you in any position --
I can see that.	You're looking great, baby.
I don't know. I'm beginning to feel guilty.	What about?
Is she all right?	I don't know. Just a minute#
-- Anyway.	I hope she's all right.
Hi.	Hello, George.
But aren't you#	Right now, I just don't care.
Oh, no.	# what?#
Want me to?	Let it ring.
Well, is she your girlfriend?	No.
Shit.	Hello.
You here to see my mother?	Yeah.
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.	Why do you wanna know so bad?
Nothing, I guess# have you ever made it with a guy?	Have you ever made it with a girl?
Well, are you?	Am I what?
I'd like to do your hair sometime.	Why?
Yeah, it is.	I never get my hair done.
I am not!	Look#  Do you wanna fuck me?
Right now?	Yeah.
George!	Yeah.
What!	Somebody's going to have to wash Mrs. Young. Mary's not here.
So how's Norman?	Great. Who's been doing your hair?
Jesus#	-- Yeah# your car down here?
-- Well no. It never came up.	You going to tell him?
Shut up, it's all right.  Do you want a drink?	No, thanks.
Where do you want to do this?	Probably the bathroom.
Well, what do you think?	I'd cut it#
Okay# but I want you to know one thing.  I've got to look great tonight, I mean I have to look great, okay?	Okay.
No.	Why not?
Why not?	# he tried to# uh# make it with me.
George#	I just have to do one little thing.
Now, baby# if I told you about her# then you couldn't count on me not telling anymore# could you?	You did, didn't you?
Baby#	You did, I know you did.
George#	Yeah, baby#
No! Don't! Please!	I don't want to# I swear#
Sit down.	What are you talking about?
-- Just get me out of here, baby. I can't stand it. It's killing me.	-- we can't now.
-- you are.	Fuckin' A --
-- gee#	-- what?
That sounds like me.	I am you, you little bastard.
-- where'd you go?	-- oh I thought you were --
What's wrong?	-- do you want ice?
-- we're kidding ourselves.	-- we are?
-- Jesus --	-- well you better go after her.
-- good afternoon --	-- you've got to leave.
I've got to leave?	-- yes, honey, you've got to get out of here.
Where are you going?	Please, we'll have to talk later --
You're going to kill me.	No --
Yeah!	Wash her.
-- White ladies?	-- Oh my yes.
-- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George# you know better#	-- oh -- sweetheart#
Nothing, my sister's back from Vegas.	That's too bad.
Hi, George.	Hey, baby, what's happening?
Call me!	I don't have your number, stop by the shop.
I've had these dumb dreams lately.	What?
I don't know. I can't remember. It was just in my dream.	No shit?
Nobody's gonna get you. Now get inside.	George, I don't --
George --	Keep moving --
How are you, baby?	Fine. How are you?
Honey?	Yeah, baby.
Will we live together?	We live together now.
Maybe you don't even like children.	Of course I like children.
George.	Hey, baby, what's happening?
Yeah, baby#	How did it go at the bank?
Great.	Could I talk to you for a second?
Yeah.	I said I wasn't sure if I could go.
What do you want?	Your advice!
When?	When I get off work.
What business meeting?	Look at the way I live.
I know, honey.	Maybe I should get a dog# no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
I've got to get her out of here.	-- go ahead.
I don't want to fight, George.	I don't want to fight either. Look# uh -- I love you.
How come you took your own car?	I didn't want him meeting me here.
You did fuck him, didn't you?	I'm very tired, George.
Didn't you, baby?	Let go of me.
That was him.	Yes.
Yes.	Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
-- and take this with you.	Where did this come from?
Obviously.	How many?
Baby, please don't# I love you.	I don't want to be a fool!# I want to look them in the eye and say, I know!
# well I'm glad you told me.	Jesus.
What? What? What? What? What?	# honest. At least you're honest with me.
I wish you'd go now.	That's all you've got to say?
What're you here for?	-- A wash and set.
It's an unusual trade.	Yes it is.
It's good you want to do something, George.	Thank you.
George, could you -- excuse us for a minute?	Sure.
When?	When?
I wish my son knew what he wanted to do.	Oh yeah?
Sorry, honey, I#	That's okay, that's okay, just shut the door.
# she's very upset#	What about, tonight?
Well -- I could try. Do you wash your hair every day?	Isn't that bad for it?
You live like a pig.	Yeah.  How long have you been here?
I wanna hear about it.	Oh Jesus Christ.
I wanna hear about it, George.	Hey, have 'em put me away, or whatever you're gonna do, okay?# I'm too tired to lie, I'm too tired to tell the truth# I'm too tired for anything.
Want a drink?	No thanks.
You don't have a clean glass in the house.	I know.
Hell of a way to treat a business partner, that's all I can say.	Who?
You really think so?	Yes I do.
What took you so long?	Wasn't sure it was you.
You're home.	Yeah.
I called to tell you I was sending one over but the line was busy, you're always on the phone.	I am?
Shut the door, shut the door!	Oh, I'm sorry.
I'd like a drink.	Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.
Here.	Aren't you going to have one?
Well, he is.	So what's your point?
Five times a day?	-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
Oh. thank you.	Sure.
This other couple that we're here with, do you know them very well?	Well# sure#
George? Was he alone?	I don't think so.
What's wrong?	We can't really leave that poor man here alone.
-- still -- at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon.	I'm telling you he won't know the difference.
-- I'll get in the back --	-- oh no, honey, I'll do that#
No!	John#
No of course not.	-- we're going to be here all night.
Everything okay, son?	Terrific. Now all I have to do is find my car keys.
Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.	Well# that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink.
Dad?	Yes?
How's it going, Doc?	Okay.
Are you having a good time?	Yes, Dad.
No.  I'm just a little tired.	Then why don't you go to sleep?
Yes I do.  I love it.  Don't you?	I guess so.
Dad?	What?
Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you?	No, Dad.
I love you, Danny.  I love you more than anything else in the whole world, and I'd never do anything to hurt you, never# You know that, don't you, huh?	Yes, Dad.
Do you like ice cream, Doc?	Yeah.
Why don't you want to talk about it?	I'm not supposed to.
Yes.	How does he tell you things?
I don't know.	Now think real hard, Doc.  Think.
Maybe he showed me something.	Try to think what it was.
Yeah, I guess so.	What about Tony?  He's looking forward to the hotel, I bet.
We'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel, okay?	Okay, Mom.
Yeah.	Danny, come on over here.
Okay Danny, you win.  Let's take the rest of this walking, huh?	Okay#oh!
It's so pretty.	Yeah.
Mom?	Yes?
Well all right.  But really don't make a sound.	I won't, Mom.
Make sure you come right back, 'cause I'm going to make lunch soon. Okay?	Okay, Mom.
Mommy#	Danny, come here!
Mommy!	Oh!
Oh,	if you were to open your mouth now, could I see Tony?
Shall we go into the living room?	Yes.
Please#	Thank you.
Won't keep you a moment, sir.	Fine.
haven't I seen you somewhere before?	Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
I'd be glad to do that, sir.  Oh why don't you call me back in about eh twenty minutes?	Thank you very much.  I'll do that.
No, we don't mind.	Good.
Bill, how do you do?	Pleased to meet you.
Nothing that I can't handle though, Lloyd.  Thanks.	Women!  Can't live with 'em.  Can't live without 'em!
It's good to see you.	It's good to be back, Lloyd.
No charge?	Your money's no good here.
Hi, babe.	Hi, hon.  How's it going?
Boy, we must be really high up. The air feels so different.	Uh#huh.
Perfect for a child.	Yeah.
Good Morning, hon.  Your breakfast is ready.	What time is it?
Eleven thirty - Jesus!	I guess we've been staying up too late.
Any ideas yet?	Lots of ideas.  No good ones.
It's really nice up here, isn't it?	I love it.  I really do.  I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.
and it will then take me time to get back to where I was, understand?	Yes.
I had# I had the most terrible nightmare I ever had.  It's the most horrible dream I ever had.	It's okay.  It's okay, now.  Really.
Did you find anything?	No, nothing at all.
He's still asleep.	Good.
Somebody did that to him.	I think he did it to himself.
Get him out of here?	Yes.
Jack!	How do you like it?
I#	I can't really remember.
Well I# I think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.	You think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
As soon as possible.	Jack#
Of course I am.	Of course you are.
Stay away from me!	Why?
Don't hurt me!  Don't hurt me!	I'm not going to hurt you.
Stay away from me!	I'm not going to hurt you.
Have any trouble finding us?	Oh, no problem at all.  I made the trip in three and a half hours.
JAck, just make yourself at home. Would you like some coffee?	Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn't mind.  Thanks.
Only in a very general way.	Well#
Well, obviously some people can be	put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
Good morning Jack.  I hope you haven't been waiting too long.	No problem.  In fact we had time to grab a bite to eat.
Right there.	Oh fine.  Well in view of all the ground that we to cover today, I suggest we go and have a quick look at your apartment and then get started straight away.
Hi.	Hi.
What time does the plane leave?	Eight thirty.
Can I tell you kids something?	Sure, Uncle Al.
Yes. Go away.	Let me help you up.
Marty? You okay? You've just been sitting here all morning.	Where's Mom?
Please, Uncle Al.	Will you?
Are you all right, Marty?	All except my legs# I don't think I can walk.
I used to see her every day, and she never knew what was going to happen to her, and neither did I! I mean I know how stupid that sounds, but#	Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel.
You all right, Marty?	Yeah.
You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man.	It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
What if I say no?	Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy.  Go on, now.
So have I, actually# I wish it could always be like this.	See me around to my car, Marty, and make sure I stay out of trouble at least that long.
But how?	BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
What do you want?  This is a private area!  Get lost!	You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
No# it's fine.	Yes?
Right here.  Let the others go -- they have nothing to do with this.	Joey -- do it.
Oh, girls.	Yes, Betty?
What is it, Mary?	That man -- who is he?
Hurry, Sister!	Get moving.  I'm right behind you.
Mary Clarence, are you with us?	Um, I don't really know this one#
It'll be hell.	Tell me about it.
JUST SING!	Sing!
Come on, we're late.	What?  What time is it?
What?	I# I brought you something.
Well, then there's only one thing to do.	What?
Mary Clarence!	Now you.
I'm getting experience.	You watch yourself!
Those people are wonderful!  Why don't we ever see them in church?	Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.
Mary Clarence!	Keep moving!
Goddamn it!	Mary Clarence!
Oh my Lord!	Experience!
Are you leaving us?	Oh no.  We'll always be together.
Run!  Take off!	Again?
But what do they want?  Where are we going?	She's got nothing to do with this.  Let her go.
It has come to pass.	What?
Is this all the food I get?	Yes.  Until breakfast.
This shall be your cell, Mary Clarence.	My what?
So# hi there.	I don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
Mary Clarence, perhaps you are correct.	I am?
You sent for me?	You have a phone call.
Eddie, you've got to get me out of here.	Not again.  You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are.
What'd she say?	You blew it -- big time.  She doesn't want you back.
I can't go with you.	What?
Then one day they find you.	They open a window.
We're looking for Mike.	You found him -- but we're not open yet.
I'm sorry -- I don't know what gets into him.	Who are you guys?
But you didn't tell me!	We didn't tell you what?
And if she runs?	Take care of it.
It's done?	Not# totally.
I can't believe this.  Okay, I want both you guys to go back there, and both of you shoot her at the same time.	Yeah#
Right.	So, take it off.
Get her!	Which one!
There she is!	Which one?
Joey?	Where is she?
She's gettin' away!	Forget her!  We got the one we need! Step on it!
You didn't shoot!	Neither did you!
We sound terrible   We need Mary Clarence.	We're losing it.
I'd rather sing than do anything!	It's better than ice cream.
Ice cream!	Mary Clarence -- you shouldn't have. Where did you get this?
Mary Clarence!  Sister!	It's no use.  She just isn't here.
Not a note.	Impossible.
I mean, won't she talk? She seemed kind of upset.	She did.  Bring her back.  Now.  For a talk.
Where?	Find 'em!
Maybe you should take this.	A fine idea.
# found the body this morning.  You do believe now, don't you?	Believe?
Where are we going?	Up.
What is it?	Listen.
We are leaving.	What happened?
What is it?	Stay back.
There are no other doors.  This is as far as she could have gone.	It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
Why# why are you like this?	You do not know all that has happened.  You cannot understand.
What now?	I doubt that's the end.
How are you?	Tired.
The things I said to you before# I was wrong to say them.	No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.
Blood.	What did you say?
What are you doing?	Just# keep where you are.
Where are we going?	I do not know.  Away.
The church.	He moves too fast.
What was that?	His horse.
I know you saw me.	What# ?
You cannot kill what is already dead.	Let her go!
There was not much blood, was there?	I didn't see none.
Go home.	May I see my mother?
Yeah, they's good all right.	You got any money?
Hey Jerry, how it's goin'. Good to see you. Been a long time.	Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?
How 'bout you, Jerry.	How are you, Bill?
I'll see you, Bill.	Okay, stop back by. Don't worry about your boy here, he's doin' good.
Did you decide, sir?	What you got that's good to eat?
Well, I wouldn't let it get to you.	I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
You know what, by God?	What?
Leave.	Don't tell me what to do.
You got that shit right.	What exactly do you mean by that? I don't understand.
Hey Frank. You shouldn't be coming over here. My parents really don't want you to.	I wanted to bring you some flowers. They're pretty good ones.
I wanted for you to meet Karl, too. He's my new friend. But I feel like I've always known him. I thought you should meet him.	Why? Hi, Karl.
Can you go there with us now? Me and Karl. We could just hang out. Karl has some cool books.	Frank, I just like you as a friend. Only at the secret place. Okay? I can't go there now. I'll see you later.
Wait a minute. You want to go with me? You can meet my mama.	I don't want to worry your mama with company.
Hey Karl, you off work?	Yeah.
Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?	Naw, I don't want to. Me and Karl got things we need to do.
How come Karl won't eat here with us?	I don't know. He just said he'd eat out there.
You all right, Mama?	I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
Karl, what in the world are you doing here?	I want to come back and stay here.
Karl, you up?	Yes sir.
Are you sure you're okay staying with that woman and boy?	Yes sir.
Yes sir.	So, you're really going to stay here?
Frank, don't talk that way. Who's that strange lookin' man behind you? Did he follow you in here?	Can I help you, sir?
He just got out of the state hospital.	I know.
Will that be cash or charge?	Better make it charge. 
Jesus, what happened to you?	It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.
I finished my story. I thought you might want to take a look at it.	I'd love to.
And what about for you?	Huh?
Looks like someone forgot a camera.	Yeah, I did.
Yeah. There she is. She's in quite a few from that year. She must have been on her way to work.	It's Ellen. Look at her. Look at my sweet darling.
Two, right?	Uh, better make it one.
So. Are we ready?	Ready. Any time you are.
What do you mean?	I mean, it's a good story.
I told her she was going to meet her father.	You what?
Jesus Christ. This is all I need.	You told me you wanted to meet him. Well,here he is.
So you're just going to give up and go home?	I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.
What's this?	Why don't you open it and find out?
It's for you.	For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?
You going to sit here all day?	I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
That's funny. His name is the same as yours.	Well, you and Junior have the same name, too, don't you?
Yeah? Who is it?	It's me, honey. It's Mom.
Well?	Well what?
I'll tell you why they're not going anywhere.	Yeah? And why is that?
Hey, Jimmy. You got the time?	Huh?
Mostly what.	You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but I might be able to help.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry# I was trying to reach for one of the books up there #  And then, I don't know, the sky fell on top of me.	It just won't do, will it? I go two and a half years without being able to write a word, and then, when I finally get started on something, when it looks as though I might actually be coming to life again, you show up and start breaking everything in my house. It just won't do, will it?
I don't know.	Is it yours?
So you're saying it wasn't like that at all.	Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you.
Hi, kid.	Wow. They sure did a job on you.
If it doesn't make any difference, why not just say it?	I was going to tell him # but in my own time. In my own time# .
I don't know.	You don't.
And when he came home.  Did he write you about this?  Or phone, perhaps.	Just showed up at my door, big as life and twice as mean.  Wanted to talk to my son.
My mom.  Would be the problem.	Why?  We're only talking.
There can't be any wrong in this, Ha#	I lie to my parents every day. And every night.
Your line of work.  You must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth.	Like you couldn't believe.
I did.  Boy.	Three kids.  What's she going to do?
You said three minutes.	Won't take two.
It's the way it happened, I know it is.	No, you don't.
That's when he fell.	Fell.
Cigarette?	I'll take two.  One for later.
You want me to say that.	I want you.  To tell the truth.
#He used to say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."	I#see.  I'm not sure I quite get your#point#
I beg your pardon.	All right, girls - from the top again.
Say, Joe - tonight's the night, isn't it?	I'll say.
Yeah - where were you?	With you.
We didn't see anything -  - did we?	No - nothing.  Besides, it's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off -
Where are we running, Joe?	As far away as possible.
Men?	Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
Steady, boy.  Just keep telling yourself you're a girl.	I'm a girl.  I'm a girl.  I'm a girl -
Hi, Jerry.  Everything under control?	Have I got things to tell you!
Telephone call?  Who's got time for that?	We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
All right - so what do we do now?	First thing we got to do is get out of these clothes.
Good night, Sugar.	Good night, honey.
I'm a girl, I'm a girl, I'm a girl -	What did you say?
You all right?	I'm fine.
I tell you - this is the only way to travel.	You better put on the lights. I can't see what I'm doing.
Not you, Sugar.	I'm just going to get some ice.
Here you are, Sugar.	A bunch of us girls are going for a swim. Want to come along?
We don't have to run.	Oh yes, we do!
Oh, come on - you can do better than that.	I met one of them.
What do you mean, maybe?  I saw the way he looked at you.  He'll be there for sure.	I hope so.
Did he get fresh?	Of course not.  As a matter of fact, it was just the other way around.  You see he needs help.
Where did you girls play before?	Oh - here and there - and around.
I was it.	What's the big idea?
What's wrong with us?	You're the wrong shape.  Goodbye.
Just a moment, miss -  May I?	Help yourself.
Please.  It won't happen again.	No, thank you.  I'll walk.
Anything today?	Oh, it's you!  You got a lot of nerve -
Put it here.	Sugar, you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble.
What's happened?	Search me.  I mean - I'll see.
Okay, Sugar - all clear.  You better go back to bed.	I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
Thanks, honey.	Good night, Sugar.
I wish they'd put us in the same room.	So do I.  But don't worry - we'll be seeing a lot of each other.
The most wonderful thing happened -	What?
Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.	I am?
Been waiting long?	It's not how long you wait - it's who you're waiting for.
See?  Nothing.	Nothing at all?
Is that anything?	Thanks just the same.
Would you do me a favor?	What is it?
Well - ?	I'm not quite sure.  Try it again.
I never knew it could be like this.	Thank you.
Good night.	Good morning.
Oh, no.  I'm off that stuff - for good.	Did you have a nice time?
Sugar!  What do you think you're doing?	I told you - I'm not very bright.
Good evening, sir.	I come to the old lady's funeral.
I should get going.	Are you sure youe okay?
Hey.	Hey.
It was such a long time ago.	Still--
Where Nick sleeping?	Why, with you.
Huh?	I not as square as my daughter thinks.
I be happy to. Youe welcome.	Oh, don be that way.
What going on with you two?	I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now she getting married.
I thought you said you were crap.	I had to say something to get you here.
You heading to the train station?	I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
What his problem?	What?
Hey.	Oh, hello.
Hey, man.	Sorry, can you give us a moment?
Seeing you again#.	Yeah?
That was a long time ago.	It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
What color are my shoes?	You have feet?
What did he say exactly? I mean, you don think he wants me back?	I don know.
No, count it, anyway.	Why?
What?	It cute.
Have you ever done anything like this before?	A weekend?
Sorry. I a little nervous. I never thought something like this would happen to me.	This happened to you?
Yes.	What?!
Don stop asking questions, okay?	Okay.
It hard to explain.	Show me.
Is this for last night?	Of course not. How#how could it be? Nothing happened.
Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. It all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do. You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, youe not walking away!	Oh, cut the crap!
I sorry I was such a bitch. I really appreciate your doing this.	It my job.
Yeah. You?	Yeah.
Hi.	Hi.
I should go.	What?! No, no. You can--
Like fifteen.	Dad made me go over and apologize the next day.
Oh, no. He told you.	You knew?
Yeah.	Then for once in your life, do something for yourself.
You keep looking around, David. Don't you go to school?	Sometime, but not like this.
You got a pretty house, Miss Johnson!	I try#
And you say all them people is dead now?	That's right--
Here it is, right here.	That's where we come from first?
Here's one by a man that's very much alive.	What's his name?
Well, how did you like the class, David?	It was the best thing I ever been to, Miss Johnson!
What are you looking at, out there? There's nothing to see.	My daddy likes to look into the dark, even when there ain't nothin to see -- it's what you hear he say.
How was your sister after you pulled her out of the water?	She was dirty and wet#
Clarence, would you tell us a story that was not true, after telling us it was?	No, Miss Johnson#
I see you found what you was lookin' for.	I did look, Charlie, but I--
David Lee#	Yes, sir#
Son, that was some trip you went on#	Where was you, Daddy?
Goodnight, Daddy#	Goodnight to you, son#
Daddy, you home now# that's all I want -- I don't want nothin' else#	Come here, son#
Where's everybody?	They gone to the field#
I'm real proud of how you helped your mama to keep this place goin', David Lee.	Thank you, Daddy#
You hurt, Daddy!?	No, no, I'm all right, son# This damn leg just won't act right no more!
From Miss Johnson --	Well, ain't you gon' open and read it for us?
I love you, son! Don't ever think I don't love you!  We gon' get to be friends?	Yes, Daddy! Yes!
You know somethin', Daddy?	What's that, son?
David Lee, it's time for you to get to bed!	Goodnight.
Who is they?	Children, come here#
Don't take my Daddy! Please don't take my Daddy!	David, come back here!
What is it, David Lee?	Listen, Mama#
Poor creature#	He'll be all right, Mama. I'll make him all right.
Can I go day after tomorrow?	Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
I cut it on some glass and we got lost, Mama.	Did you find your father?
What's wrong with him, David?	It's the heat.
Be good and be smart, little boy.	Yes, ma'm#
Would you like to have a cool drink, David?	No, thank you -- I gotta go do some work in the field today.
Come, I'll take you home.	I'll walk#
This done happen before. It ain't nothin' -- I just have to wait a minute or two.	Is there something I can do to help you?
There, you see?	I see, all right -- It's time for us to get out of this field.
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?!	I said -
Dude!	What? Fuck you guys, I wanna get out of here.
Come on, you guys# We have to THINK!	About what?
What?	I saw him last night!
Dude, that movie was fucking sweet!	You bet your fucking ass it was!
Goodnight, honey.	Mom# When is the war gonna be over?
Mom#	Yes, hon?
May I?	What?
No# The General is right.	MOM!!!
It's so very cold#	We can't leave without you!
This is terrible! This can't be happening!!	We HAVE to see this movie, dude!
That was sweet!	Where do they come up with this stuff?!
How can they do this?	It isn't fair!
What? What don't I get?  What don't I get?	I don't know, dude.
This is sweet!!	Totally!
Dude, do you know what you're doing?	No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.
Wow, a lot of people showed up.	Yeah, so what do we say?
And Bill?	Yes?
It's from your mother.	My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say?
You'd fuck your uncle!	YOU'D fuck your uncle!
Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!!	Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
You know I do.	I know.
What if I just left?	Where're you gonna go, bitch? Besides, you know that if you left me, I'd hunt you down and kill you, right? I'm gonna go grab a drink.
Hey, I'm missing the party!	No! It can't be!
Now do what I say and keep your fucking mouth shut!	THAT'S IT!  I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!!
Will you two please stop it!  I don't want to spend my final hours listening to you bitch!	I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
I think we're moving.	Well isn't that great.  Something to write home about.
Jesus, come on!	They're not going to make it!
Evening.	It can't be.
Well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy the rest of the trip.	I'm sure I will.
What did you say to me?	It's a little late for you to be up.
All too well, captain.	Well shut it off at once!
No, I just ran it!  Why are you running it again?	Well it's a good thing that I did.
You're certain of that?	Trust me.  Even checked 'em with my own eyes.
I think I can handle it.	Well, maybe I will.  You sure you don't want anything?
Bridge!  Can anyone hear me?!	Yeah yeah yeah, give me a minute here.
Now do you want the good news first or the bad news?	You better start making sense!
Mac, can you hear me?  Come in?	Taylor, you surprise me.
Idiot#	Good help is hard to find#
Well that's your call.  Doesn't make a damn bit of difference to me.  Just as long as I get my cut.	Oh you'll get it, believe me.  So I'll see you in a few.
Is that clear?	That's clear.
Look at this#Jesus.	Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.
What's the use#we're gonna die#	Don't say that!  It ain't over till it's over!
We're going to die.	Will you shut up already?
It's getting hard to breathe#	Just don't move around too much.
Oh right, right you're on that research grant.	That's right.
What are we going to do?	I don't know.
We don't.	Well maybe there's a way out of here.
OK#it's open.	Seen one like it before?
And suppose you couldn't hold out?	Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?
Everyone just stay put.	Wait.
I can't let you do that.	Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
Are you ready?	Ready as I'll ever be.
Yeah.  We did it.	So we did.
You're ready for the real thing?	At this point I'm ready for anything.
Taylor?	Yeah?
Do you want some advice?	Sure.
I'm not going with you.	What?  What are you talking about?
And what are you going to do?!	I'm going to try and buy you some time.  I can get to the bridge from here.
What the hell are you doing?	We have room!  Let's go!
So close#	And so far.
Will you marry me?	Marry you?
Well now what are we gonna do!	How am I supposed to know?
It's getting too cold in here.  I can't stand this anymore!	Baby, take it easy.
Look.  We're talking about life and death here.  I don't know why we're even having this conversation.	Well what would you know about it? You don't have anything to lose.
I haven't quite made up my mind yet.	I'll tell you what you're gonna do.  You're gonna stay put like Taylor said.
Ok Mac#  I'll talk to you on this. I want to find a way to get to the bridge, then I want you to come back.	Certainly.  Anything I can do to be of service.
I'm looking for a man.	What kind of man?
Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.	You afraid we're gonna steal it?
Where'd you get this ball?	It's mine.
Who are you? Who sent you here?	I'm your son. You're a hard father to find.
What the fuck is this?	What's it look like to you?
Theo, I want you to get out of this town.	I'm getting to like it here.
So, eh, you never saw me. Right?	I never saw you.
My poor baby!	You see what you did?  Take your ball and get out.
Hello?	Hello, mom?
Don't tell me, John.	Cool!
I have someone for you to play with Junior.	Someone wants to play with me?
So you're Buzz's boy. I've been expecting you. You hurt my feelings when you didn't come and see me sooner.	You know who I am?
You're just like you mother! Always jealous!	That's why Mom ran away, because you had to control everything!
Do those two work for your dad or mine?	Mine, and they never tip.
I came here to have a word with your dad.	What do you want with my dad?
Mind if I cut in?	No, not at all.
Do you talk with your mom?	It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
What are you going to do about your brother?	You're here.
It wouldn't bother you if Buzz was in danger, would it?	Nope, I couldn't care less.
You told Junior that we did it.	It?
How do you get this thing down?	Tell me what happened Theo.
You wanted me to kill him, didn't you?	If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.
Where are you going?	I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.
Very professional.	I am a professional man.
There's heat coming the door.	Back away then.
Hold on --	What is it?
They told me about sixty hours.	Two and a half days?
Back at the door -- I asked you to back away.	Yeah.  I heard you.
Nobody move.	But she's --
Where is it?	Why can't I -- ?  What the hell is going on here?
Don't do it, Norman!	Do you see it?
Don't do it!	Now!
Norman, please!  Don't!	Pull it, damn it!
Thank you, Colonel.	Captain.
Come with me.  The team's already waiting.	What team?
Good.  Security's been our biggest worry.  Now that you're here we can shut this thing down tight.	From what?  What's with all the security?
How deep is he?	A thousand feet.
What is it, Norman?	Take a look.
Maybe we shouldn't.	What?
Harry's missing.	What do you mean, he's missing?
You can't just leave Harry down here, sir.	I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
What the hell?  It shut us down.	Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
I see it.	Pull it.
Get him out of there.  I thought I told you people --	Harry?  Can you copy?
Any sign of Harry?	Nothing, sir.
Nothing, sir.	What the hell is going on here?
Yes, sir.	Well, where the fuck is he?
Ted?  Captain?	Yes, Harry.
So how do we get it open?	Ted seems to have some ideas.
Gimme a report, I want --	Ladies and Gentlemen#
Ted, get her away from the door.	What are you going to do -- shoot her?
Look at this.	What is it?
What's wrong?	What do you make of this?
How can he be missing?	Sir, about leaving --
You're next, Norman.	No.  Go ahead.  Really.  Ladies first.
Norman!	Get this thing off me.
Norman.	What are they?
You said something to him, didn't you?	What?
You fixed my suit?	You don't trust me?
Still clear?	Still clear.
Looks like some sort of code.	Why would Harry go back to using a code?
I'm sorry.	For what?
What is it, Norman?	Where are you?
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.	Your watch.
What's wrong, Norman?	I'm feeling better.
It's getting cold.	You think I'd really drink that?
It's your choice.  Because it's not safe for you to be awake.  To be walking around.  To be thinking about things.	It's not safe for you to be either.
Then where's it coming from?	From you, Norman.  From your mind. You're doing it.
What is that?  What are you doing?	What?
Would it work?	Yes.  And I think we already know it will.
I don't get it.	It doesn't make any sense.
He doesn't wait for an answer.	Who says it's a he?
It's empty.  Why would someone build a ship like this?	You'd have to ask them.
When he woke up, he said we were out of food.  He told me to get some from the ship.	I never said that.
Just in time, too.	In time for what?
Why are you looking at me like that?	Like what?  I'm not --
How are you feeling, Norman?	What?
Go ahead.  Ladies first.	No, why don't --
C'mon.	Wait a second, I --
C'mon, Norman.	Look, would you --
Nice work, Norman.	Whatever I can do to help.
Our answer.	To what?
This answers one of our questions.	Which one?  Let me get the list out.
I can't.  If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong.	Am I?
Norman?	What is it, Harry?
# you there?  Norman?	Harry?
We just figured, you know, the three of us -- we need to# work together through this.	The three of us.
What is it?	You know what it is, Harry.
Did I kill her?	I don't think so.
Fine.	Help me lift her.
We're never gonna make it.	Shut up and open the door.
I can't reach her.	Hold on.
Push her, c'mon.	I'm trying.  Shit.  Here -- catch her.
Missed.	Are you trying, damn it?  Just --
Hold on.	Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
Get her out of the seat, I need room to sit.  Harry?	I'm trying.  There.
You know how to work this thing?	No idea.
She told me what you said, Norman.	What is it, Harry?
English?	That's right.
What'd you say?	"We are friends".
Good idea, Ted.	Thank you.
Norman Johnson.	Does this mean what I think it means?
How are the others?	The others, sir?
That whole time -- I couldn't stop thinking of what Harry was saying earlier#	What was that, sir?
By the way sir, I've read your report.  I think it's brilliant.	What report?
Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.	Who's going to pay me then?
Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.	Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing.	But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
That is not a human decision, not your or mine.	What do you mean?
What's wrong?  What's happening?	Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.
I can't see!  How can I fight?	Try to feel it.  Use the Force#
I found it# It's just not there.	What are you saying?
You can't!  We've come this far.  We must find them#	Why?
This isn't going to work.	Why didn't you say so before.
Is he afraid of the water?	No, he smells something# but we haven't time to worry about it now.
Get to the ship!	Come back here# Where are you going?
I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five# I thought I'd help.	Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.
What is it?  What's going on?  Where are we?	You're safe.  We've come to get you out of here# Just relax.
And you?	I# I don't know.  I guess I never thought about it# I just want to help.  I want to be in on the attack. I want my own ship.
Our love will grow, dear, year by year#	Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !
I don't believe it !	I got Games & Theory.
Are you alright ?	I'm getting better.
So what are you doing later ?	Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
I'm all ears.	Don't you have to finish the game ?
Where are you going ?	A funeral.
Good for you.	Your turn#
You can't walk me home.	Why not ?
Isn't it great to be in love ?	How do I know if this is love ?
Everyone's looking# we shouldn't#	Who cares ?
I wonder where Carl is. You don't suppose#?	Naw, I made it, Carl made it.
He was in the group with me. I guess he didn't#	Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse.
You're late.	My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.
You talk to Carl ?	He left this morning. He couldn't say where.
I'm gonna miss you.	I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
Do you mean it ?	I said it. Isn't that enough ? Don't forget to write !
Well, look at this. The three of us back together again.	How are you, Carl ?
Which way ?	Up. We gotta be near A Company by now.
Leave me, Lieutenant ! That's an order !	No way, ma'am !
Cover me.	You got it.
C'mon#	Nah, I don't do that anymore#
Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can.	We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
Oh, my, what's that ?	Looks like rain.
Well, it's just good to hear from you. What's up, son ?	It's not really working out for me here, dad. I was thinking# I was hoping it would be alright if I came home.
Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?	Uh, no.
Hello# Oh, Johnny#!	Hi, mom.
Don't get any ideas. She's my girl.	You can never be sure.
Let's go.	Move out.
Can you walk ?	Not a problem.
How bad are you, pal ?	Been better, buddy.
Don't be a hero#	This is my farm. Now c'mon, give me what you got and get out of here#
All dead except one, sir.	Kill the bitch.
Our data is being prepared.	Answer!
I'm taking over the Center seat. I'm sorry, Will.	You are what#?
Computer off!	It's taken control of the computer#!
Jim# he wants it.	You got the Enterprise, it's what you wanted. This is what I want.  But, Jim#  # I'm the right choice for this mission.
Was he difficult?	No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry#
What should you have known?	No meaning# No hope#  And, Jim, no answers#! Jim, it's looking for answers itself!
Mom's expecting you for dinner tonight.	I'll be there.
I want to rent this one.	Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.
I quit.	You quit.
You like my play.	Yes.
No, of course, you don't want to talk about it.	It's about a man who gets a second chance.
I#	No, of course, you want to get out of town.
You get what you pay for.	That's true.  You grow up here?
#who#?	Well, I guess I'll#get down to the station.  It was lovely meeting#
What I need to say#	Yes#
Tonight, tonight, I#I have play practice#	#oh#oh.  Well.  That's very important.
Hello.	I thought you had Play Practice.
You like kids?	Never saw the point of 'em.
Great.  Who is it#?	"Room Service!"
Hi.	You going to ask me in?
Thank you.	Read the card.
Don't you think you should put them in water?	Why?
Start?  This isn't a good time.	Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?
You can do it.	Because I'd met someone else.
Ah.  Ah.  Ah#	I hurt you?
Hi.	Hi.
Going home, yeah.  I told them what you said#	What?
I didn't say anything special, I was just talking out loud.	#how else can you talk?
Would you like to see it?  I've got the key back at my store#	I'd love to.
Press still works.	It does?
Good morning.	Sleep well?
What is it all about?	I saw#
What are you going to do?	I'm going to tell the truth.
I'll wait for you#I'm proud of you. I'll be waiting.	If I go to jail#?
And I might have something important to tell you#	What is it, a surprise?
What, what what are you doing here?	Yes, that's right.
Hi!	We had a date.
A jacket for five dollars#I can buy this town for fifty bucks.	You told me that about the last town.
How big is this horse?	Fifteen hands.
Then she wasn't in the car.  Say it.	She wasn't in the#
Stay ready.  Stay by yourself in your room.	What'll I do for fun?
Bobby, don't say anything.	Nothing happened.
Then I hope you wouldn't tell anyone that I gave you this.	I wouldn't tell anyone anything that happened between me and somebody who was my friend.
Nice town that you've got here.	You want to see it better, we could go out on the roof.
Are you all right#?	I#
Her#	I swear that that woman in my room#
What else?	Page#three.  Now:  "It's a nice evening."  I'm not gonna say that# "It's a nice#"
If your memory was as long as your dick, you'd be in good shape.  How long since you almost went to jail for this shit?	How could she turn on me like that?  I thought she liked me.
You do#?	I just don't know what order they come in#
I'm very sorry to#	Well.  What seems to be the#?
I've got scene twelve#  Shouldn't you be in school#?	It's night.
Aren't you ever in school?	There's other things to be learned.
No.	Then what is the#?
Get him on the phone.	He's on the Island, he'll be back on#
You have no right to#	Cool it, Babe, you started this#
Look.	I feel so close to you#
You have to hide.	Who is that#?
Fuck flowers, we aren't talking about flowers, we're talking about a human being.	I#I#
#I know#I know#	#and, and, and did she#?  And she did the seven shows#
No, are you kidding me, Bob, not at all.	Marty#
Kiss my ass.	Well.
What?	Who got their heads cut?
Where you off to?	I, uh#I'm leaving.
Arrest him.	What is the#?
Hi.	I'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.
What's in the case?	Eight hundred thousand dollars in cash.
It's about a man who gets a second chance.	Then, you write that.  And then this is our second chance.  That's why we're here#
I want to make a good film.	I know you do.
What's the#	Where have you been#?
I can't.	Why?
Why?	I hurt my finger.
Let's speak English.  You've got to help the side.	You want me to lie.
You can't write it?	I can write it.  I can't type it.
How do they know that, you told them?	No.
Stop#	That's what I said.
Do something.	You tell me what to do, I'll do it.
You hear that?	Yes, I hear it.
We have to lose the window.	#we can't lose the wind#
Ben!  What's wrong?	I killed her!
I didn't say that.  Why would I say that?	Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.
Oh God oh God Oh God oh God oh God Oh#	#why do you think?
So why are you asking me?	I like talking about it.  At least, to you.
But we do have a choice.  To make it better.  Instead of worse.	Like how?
Wow.  Who's that for?	Well.  It's for you.
#I mean, she knows all the music, and pop stars, and clothes and stuff. She's like still a kid, herself.	Like a big sister.
Actually.  She's kind of cool, when you get to know her.	I bet.
And don't tell her I told you.	Secret's safe with me.
He wouldn't know.  I saw her in the shower!	And#?
You wouldn't kiss him, huh?	Not with my mouth open.
He's not even there.  You don't see him, you don't hear him, you're just too much of a woman to bother with little boys.	This is a joke, right?
I don't want to say goodbye.	Don't. Take me with you.
Keep Ben's for awhile, okay?  Until he's old enough to not open them all at once.	Until he's old enough to read.
Are you afraid for me?  Where I'm going.	Yes.
I don't have to listen to you!  You're not my mother.	Thank God for that!
What I meant and perhaps I didn't say it well was you have a great mom.  You don't need another one.  But when you're at this house --	This is my daddy's house --
Lunch time Sleeping Beauty.  Where's Ben?  Is he in the bathroom?	I don't know#I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
Help me here#	Uh.  He thinks his nose is too big.  But it's not.
I hate her.  I really hate her.	There you are!
Put down that goddamn camera!	You owe me a quarter.
You know, this horse smells really bad.	There's worse things.
Are you real mad?	How could I be?  We learned some magic#
IS THAT YOU?	IT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND, BIG GUY, OPEN UP.
Ben!  Oh my Ben!  Are you alright?	I knew where I was all the time.
That I do.  Always will.	Mom#?
So you're okay.	I'm still sick, but I'm better.
Okay.  These are good.	I helped.
So what do you think we're gonna talk about?	You dying.
People beat it, don't they?  All the time.	Every day.  More and more.
That's necessary, huh?	Let's take our best shot.
Why would his worry?  Or my children's worry.  Or anyone's worry.  Help the sit#	Sooner than later.  You really need to.
You can't do that, I won't let you!	No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to keep, not a job that's hard to lose, can't be both.
Are you here?	I'm here.
I'm afraid she's going to walk.	And I'm supposed to care.
It's going to be hard for the kids when I tell them#I'd like you to be there.	To make it easier for them or you?
I know.  I wouldn't know what to say.  If it were you.	We're going to win this.
What happens next?	I live or I die.
#in.	I'm sorry.  Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but#
You feeling all right?	Not great.  Plus, I've got things on my mind.  You know.
Did I hear the word#	Luke.  Can't live like that.
You bet you are.	How the hell would you know?
They came out of my body!	See, I know that.
She hasn't mentioned this.	She was afraid you'd make a big deal out of it.
Can I look at the pictures?	It's a mess, right now.  That's my project when I get back.
My advice to you?  Don't die.	Feeling the pressure?
Now we're going to have a fight, you and I.	Are we.
You've turned her into you.  And I may not get another chance.  To turn her back.	That's what it is.  And that's all it is.
I love Luke, I love the children. But there is more to life than even love#	No, there isn't.
The way you cook.  If you could make love, I'd marry you.	We have to talk.
You don't trust me to be alone with them.	I trust you of course I do but --
Look.  I know they hate me.	They don't hate you --
Oh my God.  Are you serious?	I think so#What do you think?
It's forever you know.	Okay#Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
She's not gonna die.	I know that.
Just like to make sure.  That your past.  And my future.  Are real different.	Well, they will be.
Can we go sit somewhere?	Let me put it this way.  Hell, no.
'#I don't know if I can make it.' That's what I said.  But I didn't leave.	No, she threw you out.  What a difficult woman.
Where you goin'?	I'm gonna get me a drink.
Out! Leave the table!	What?
Hey.	Hey. What's up?
Sometimes I feel like my parents don't love me.	Well then, when you get older you can do something about it.
This is definitely better.	You think so? You don't think that this might not be a little dry?
Sure!#	Of course, honey. Come in bed with us. Come on.
Was anyone in my room today?	Is everything OK?
What are you going to do?	I dunno.
We did the same thing last year also.	How was the class?
Hey, you want to hear my short story now?	Huh?
What do you want?	Don't be so upset. It's OK#
Fuck!	I'm going in there.
So? How was school today?	The same.
Get the hell outta here!	Man, it's just, like, conversation.
OK.	Tired of this shit#
I don't think there's any hope, either. I was just trying to make you feel better.	Thanks.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all.	Well, now you have.
Yeah, um, then#are you alone?	Uh huh.
You're not.	Good.  'Cause I#um#I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was#
It's over there.	Thanks.
It's a really nice place you have. Is the rent high?	Take off your top.
No, not really.	Any books you like to read for fun?
Yeah#So you're um#you're married?	Yeah.
You want some?	No, thanks.
What is most important to you?	I dunno. I'd like to be good at something. It doesn't have to be TV. I mean, it could be movies#Anything. I'd be willing to direct.
Is he with the girl?	I don't know--look!  They can get in now, man!  We got no one left to guard it!
I'll lead.	Why? Are we going dancing?
What now?	We're outta here--
--be prepared.	We don't have time!
Let's move it we got company!	What happened!
Forget about it.	I wasn't angry with you I was angry with him.
I'm going first.  Taking the fire. If we go out together we're all dead!	What are you talking about?
How's the arm?	It's nothing to worry about.
That's it!  Up ahead!	Where does it lead?
I suppose#you think I should thank you.	Yes, you should.
Come on, drink up.	I don't want any#
So, what are we looking at White?	What do you mean?
Where the hell could they have gone!	What are you so worked up about jack? Fuck 'em--we don't need 'em.
Can I have a glass of water?	Certainly - how about some breakfast?
Excuse me, Mister President, but you forgot to give me my camera back.	Oh, yes, that's right.
Perhaps you gentlemen would like to check with the source?	You mean you'll tell us his name???
Go back to sleep, baby.	What did you say, sir?
Colonel, you're not drunk, are you, man?	No, sir.
Well, Mister President.	What kind of trouble?
Yes, sir.  One thing, Mister President.	Yes?
Why do you think I ask?	I don't know, sir. We just spoke a few minutes ago.
Let me worry about that, Major. I've still got my red line to the Air Command.	That's right, sir.
Suppose that were the case?	But -- why#that would be an awful thing to do, sir.
I suppose they are, sir.	You're damned right they are.
What shall we drink to, sir?	To peace on earth.
Well, I know they've been going on for years, and they haven't gotten any place.	Not yet, Major.  Not yet.
Major, those are my boys out there dying.	Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
To peace on earth, Major.	Peace on earth.
Then this is it.	What?
No, this looks like the real thing.	Yeah, it sure looks like the real thing, all right.
So am I.	Listen, I think I'm hit bad.
How do you know he's dead?	Hell, he looks dead.
He's dead, all right.	Listen, give me a shot quick!
You sure have to hand it to those guys.	What do you mean?
What do you mean?	Well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.
We are?	Alright. She told him to meet us here. Fuck.
That was really great.	Was it okay?
Uh, home, you know.	Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I didn't get you in trouble.
Yeah, we all want to see him. So when's he coming?	Yeah, when's he coming?
Hey!	Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
Stuck with what guy?	What?
I don't know. Later. I don't know.	Yes!
Don't let 'em fight.	The dude wants it.
A long, long, long, long, while.	Okay, okay.
Go!	# idiot! Open the damn door! Go, go, go, come on!
Fuck it!	You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
Hey! Whoa, you look like shit. You been home yet?	No, no.
Fuck her! Come on, let's go.	Jeff! Let's go!
Yeah.	Come on.
Sure. You make art and you want people to see it.	Wait, what happened to the tree?
Really?	You know, I should, um, make a video of this place. You know, bring the camera in.
Come on man.	Hey, don't tell us about private property. This is America, my friend.
Hey, man.	Hey.
What do you mean? His girlfriend?	Well, that's one way of putting it.
Hey, we're just having a conversation.	This is private property, my friend.
It's safe, come on.	That's it. That's it! I'm calling the police.
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself.	Are you talking to me?
Yeah, we're all above that.	See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it, it's a song about#
No, no, no, no, no, it's new.	Please.
Whoa!	No, no, whoa!
Hey, I'm glad you put truth in your song, man. That's important.	Hey, thanks, man.
Thanks. See man?	You know? I remember coming here with my parents.
You okay, man? You okay?	I didn't want to eat this much, man.
Thanks, man!	I'll be in the car, okay?
Will you stand up for me?	Okay.
Hi.	Hi.
Thinks he is. Well, he is.	He is?
You know, it was the biggest mistake of my life.	Really?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's, you know, it's a bed and hot water.	It does look good.
It's coming along.	Thank you.
Can you tell me what happened?	He's drunk.
You don't need to sit next to me right now.	Who were you talking to?
Oh, no, no, no. This is no big deal, you know? I can come down and, and get you out.	No, no. I'm not, I'm not talking about this. I did a bad thing, Jeff.
Jeff, stay there.	He's got a gun. He's got a gun.
You know, this, what you're doing with your life#	I don't know.
No, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! What is your name?	Look, why do you care, huh?
Please?	Look, look, just get off my property.
This has nothing to do with me! She went up by herself. Yeah I tell them don't go on the roof! They can't go on the roof!  How is she?	I don't know. I think she's breathing.
God, I haven't seen you all day.	You could've come over.
Was that supposed to be me?	No.
No, not, not everything. This. I am the man in your life.	Man?
Yes, you asshole.	About what?
Of course I do!	Name one.
Come on.	No. No, no, no.
Oh, hi. I thought you guys got lost.	Hey, where did you go? We were worried about you.
I've run out of words.	Wait. What, what are you saying?
You really suck, you know that?	Just go.
Sorry.	So how's college?
So you think I should?	What?
Great.	Yeah, maybe later.  Hey! Hey!
Well, I helped start it, but, you know, uh#	Well, not exactly.
So who are you?	What do you mean?
George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?	No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
I gotta take a piss. Do you mind if we pull over really quickly?	Oh, yeah.
Get off my roof!	Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!
Ready?	What are you saying?
I hope you're happy!	This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
Okay, now, you guys all take care, okay? Oh, man, I feel so good. I feel good 'cause I'm hanging out with you guys, man. You know? I mean, I forgot what it was like to just hang out.	Yeah.
Yeah, come on, play it.	Oh, no, man. I can't.
Alright, alright already.	Alright!
Jesus, Jeff.	Hey, man, uh, look, if you don't like my stuff, uh, I won't sing it, okay? I'm sorry, you know?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.	No, no, no, no, no. Uh, hey, man. You know I'm really sorry if I, if I said something wrong. I, I#
Soon.	Yep.
I hate it here. It's so ugly, it's like being dead. You got out of here, you know? I'm ready to go.	Yeah, but sometimes I try to figure out why I left in the first place, you know? I think about people and I wonder what they're doing.
Is that Jeff?	Oh, my god!
You know, my mom has this saying.	Yeah?
What the fuck are you talking about?!	Nobody's fucking anybody!
Okay. You know what? Watch your fucking language, alright? Or I might have to.	Whatever.
You know, man, it's none of your business what I do, okay?	It's none of my business?
I don't, I don't remember. What do I owe you?	Uh, eleven twenty-five.
Seriously? It's a great idea.	Ha! Thank you! See? He did it. He left.
I'm going out later.	No car.
But, we have to make a smart plan!	Of course - of course!  Hands in#
Jack, I think I should get a job.	But we agreed your job is running the baby machine#
"No" you're not sure or "No" I'm not fat?	Uh, "no"# You're not fat.
You sure you wanna go there?	Uh#maybe?
You shouldn't smoke so many of those.	I know, but it keeps down the size of my can.
Give me your coat.	Let it ride for a while.
Sure, this'll go on all night.	I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
You forgot this.	Thanks.
I mean it.  It's no good to me anyway.  Help yourself.	Why should you do that?
Look, Betty, It can't be done. It's out.	You're tough, all right.
Stop crying.  You're getting married.  That's what you've always wanted.	I don't want it now.
Hello, Betty.	I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful?
Goodbye, young fellow.  We'll see what we can do.	I'm not worried.  Everything will be fine.  The old team together. Nothing can stop us.
Just a minute, you!	Yeah?
Are you or aren't you?	I think that's what it says on my driver's license.
What's that?	Just a scene I cut out.
Now what is it?  Where's the fire?	I've lost my car.
It's a quarter past ten.  What time are they supposed to get here?	Who?
Go away.	What kind of a silly thing was that to do?
What on earth, darling? It took you hours.	I ran into some people I knew.
That's a lie!  They still want me!	No, they don't.
Suppose you listen just for a minute -	Madame is waiting.
I made your bed this afternoon.	Thanks.  How did you know I was going to stay, this afternoon?
I'm talking to you.  My clothes and things are up in the room.	Naturally.  I brought them myself.
Some men are here.  They asked for you.	I'm not here.
How is she?	She is upstairs.
We've come for the car.	What car?
So you need three hundred dollars? Of course, I could give you three hundred dollars.  Only I'm not going to.	No?
Bring something to drink.	Yes.  Madame.
It must be the girls. One of the girls.	But which one?
I think I'd better keep it.	Whatever you say.
I don't feel like it right now.	She didn't take it from you, did she?
What's happening?	I'm taking you to the hospital.
Don't leave me.	I have to.
You're alive! She didn't kill you!	Who didn't?
All this talk about love, it's silly.	You don't like me? You hate me?
Of Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone.	What do you feel about me?
There's one sure way to find out how you feel.	What's that?
Is this how?	Terrific.
She said it wouldn't last.	What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?
I don't love you any more.	Just like that?
Away. From you.	But why?
Hi.	Hello. Are you still mad at me?
You think so?	I don't see why not.
Wait. Don't leave me.	You'll be safe here. I'll come back as soon as I have the Power Source.
Before you go#	What?
And you can see how you feel about me, right?	Yes.
Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.	I did.
No!	I never met a man I couldn't have--and you're no different from the rest!
They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?	Yeah.
Guess! Go on.	I don't know. You seem afraid.
You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?	Well#I guess I can't.
Hey, where you going?	I've got things to do.
Where is your cousin Clark, by the way?	He's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
Can I give you a lift?	Oh, no thanks.
Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?	Oh, sure.
I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't let any of this go on. Not for one minute.	I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
What are you making:	It's going to be a tree, I think.
What's a tree?	It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.
You see, a tree is a living thing.	Can you create life?
There isn't any.	This is all your clothes?
I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since#	Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
No thanks. You go on.	You sure?
Nothing's wrong with my skin.	Such a shame. You ought to take better care of yourself.
That was meant for me!	Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.
That ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.	A cheap trick.
I'm free. I can never thank you enough.	For what?
That horrible woman!	Told you. Wouldn't listen to me. Knew it would make you sad.
There is a way.	I knew it!
You're going to take me back?	Going to try. Didn't say I could.
What's that? Never saw anything like that.	Don't stop. Keep moving.
Yeah? What do you want?	Buddy, are we in trouble.
What are you talkin' about?	Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
Man, you don't never pass out, do ya?	Nope.  Never. 
You look wonderful.	You always did.  Can I give you a hand with that?
You#um#you never got married?	Oh#I came close once.
The dog's always doing that.  And the car's always doing that.	Can I help?
He really was!	Uh-huh.
Well#  Not quite like this.	Mom and I do this all the time.
Do you really know Superman?	We get together sometimes.
Say, fella, I understand. I can -- what do the kids say these days -- "dig where you're comin' from."  You want to be rich, right?	Uh#
Hey, boss.	Just the man I wanted to see!
And do nothing. Just sit there.	Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
Yeah? How's it look?	It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
You want to mess with Superman?	Can't wait, pal, can't wait.
Thanks.  Let's go	I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by#	Sister! I'm his sister!
I thought you'd never get here.	Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
Lots of things#	Tell me.
I'll do more than tell you. I'll show you, back at my place. If you'll just do me one little favor first.	Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
I don't know you, lady.	But the other night#
How would you know?	Hey, I know a lot of things!
I can't see anything.	Turn on the light.
I can't! It's out of control!	But how? Where's it getting the power from ???!
Okay? Goodbye.	You've got to pick three more numbers.
Mr. White, the next number, please?	How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
He's coming! He's going to hurt me!	Don't bet on it!
Jimmy, how's the -	Yeah. I'll check.
Are you okay?	She'll be fine.
I don't?	Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.
Clark, everything I was saying -- can't you see I only say it because I really care?	Really?
I don't know, they look pretty happy to me#	That's because you can hardly see through those things.
Where were you?	I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
I'm in love with you. How do you feel?	We'd better talk.
I want to.	Let's go to my place.
Let's go to my place.	Your place?  Maybe I should change,  Maybe you should, too.
You did it. You gave it all up for me. I . . . I don't know what to say.	Say you love me.
Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .	Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
Blood . . . my . . . blood . . .	Let's get you inside . . . .
Don't . . . it's not your fault . . . you didn't know . . .	He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen.
Hi.	Oh, hi.
Sleep well?	Never closed my eyes.
I'll try to remember that . . .	Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
Everything on it?	Everything on it.
You'll miss the battle of the century!	Good. My heart can't take it.
It has everything.	Wrong.
Who is this . . . Superman?	You'll find out, General! And when you do . . .
Free!	Free!
Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.	What about here?
Oh . . . my . . .	Clark. . . !
Superman? Has something happened to him?	Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
Well, I don't understand.	I'm sorry.
Would you mind taking a walk with me?	Absolutely!
Is he for real?	One hundred percent.  And I like him that way.
What's he going to say?	Something . . . wonderful.
What's that?	Our other dinner guest.
Hey! He looks . . . normal.	He's . . .  beautiful. Perfect.
You think he'll find us.	Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
Destroy Superman!	Wait! Not yet! Back!
I'll deal with you later.	Right, good. Tell you what, we'll wait right here. Till you get back.
Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too!	We're running out of smoke.
Me?	Not you.  You.  Tell me again.
Mom#	I know.
Mother#	I know son, I know#
Keep warm now.	I will.
I'd like to.	Well!
I'll bet you have some good ideas.	Hey, you're getting a better class of people in your office these days, Boss.
Are there any more at home like you?	Not really, no.
Hey!	What the  --  !
Stop him, Clark!	He may have a gun!
What now, my love?	Huh?
Can I take you to the airport?	Not unless you can fly.
I'm telling you, I was there.	You were probably so scared you didn't look to see what the trick was.
What'd you call him?	Superman.  Pretty good name for him, isn't it?
Oh, what a chance! If I could just  --  get to him.	You're not the only one.
Listen#thank you.	You too.  I just#I can't get it on for good guys. Y'know?
Couldn't we forget the plane? You could lift me in your big strong arms?	Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
Nuts. He made it.	Tough guy, huh?
Bet he makes it.	You're on.
Shut up.	I didn't say a word.
Ready?	Ready.
Don't let me down.	You?! How about me?
Oh. Why? does he live up here?	Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
Boy!	Gets you where you live, huh?
It's a #baby.	What's your name, boy?
Oh, dear. That isn't what I --	What your mother means, Clark, is that she don't want folks to think you're special.
If one of you can get that  -- I mean, I want the real Superman. Who is he? Where's he from? What's his favorite ball team? What's up?	He is. Usually.
Easy now, miss, I've got you???	You've got me? Who's got you???
With my luck, now it'll rain.	Not a chance. It's too nice a night.
Superman???	Right on the first guess.
Can you actually fly faster than the speed of sound?	Sure.
Is that real enough for you?	It is for me.
Sort of.	Good enough for you. Now then --  --  tell me something I like to hear. As many times as I hear it#
I'm#so sorry.	That's okay.
What happened?	Nothing.  We made it to the hospital.  I didn't have to go as far as I was prepared to.  But I was prepared to go all the way.
My name is#	Mister, I don't want to know your name.
I can help you.	Not unless you can raise the dead.
I'll be back around nine.	Okay.
Are you sure?	Yeah.
Why would he do that?  You didn't have anything to do with the accident.	Because I was driving behind the bus, Mary.  Because I saw it.  I saw it happen#
I used to like it here.  I used to care about what happened.  Now I think I'll sell my house and move the fuck away.	Billy, please.  The children.
Have you been waiting long?	A while.
Does this mean I can't take a shower?	No.  It should be dry by now.
What time's he coming home?	When the game's over, I guess.
Yes.	It's natural.
You're leaving.	I better get back.
Good night, Billy.	Good night.
You've talked to Billy?	I did.
What do you think?	Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
So do you like your new room?	It's interesting.
Is this mine?	Yes.  It's a present.
Is he coming over now?  Right away?	That's what he said.
I don't like thinking about the accident.  I don't even remember it happening.  Besides, it just makes people feel sorry for me, and#	You hate that.
What do you mean?	People who will help our cause.
They're smart.  Been to college. They moved here from the city about a dozen years ago.	What do they do?
Have they ever been busted?	No.
You always think you're prepared for these things.	Tell me about it.
DADDY!!!	Yes.
Why can't you talk to me?	I#I just need to know what state you're in so I know#how to talk to you#how to act#
I can hear you breathing, Daddy.	Yes.  I can hear you breathing too.
So you're just the thing we need.	Excuse me?
Been drinking since high school. Fucked himself up.  Used to be smart enough.	Any criminal record?
Yes.	And where did you sit that morning?
No.	Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?
I was scared.	Why were you scared?
That was great.	Really?
What took so long?	Nothing.
They say I'm lucky because I can't remember the accident.	Don't even try to remember.
The door needs a lock.	Sure.  I'll fix it right away.
He's a lawyer.  He's our lawyer.	You and Mom have a lawyer?
You're going to need special care for a long time to come.  It's not going to be easy.  Not for you, not for any of us.  Because we love you so much.  And it's going to cost money.  More than we can imagine.	What about insurance?  Doesn't insurance pay for these things?
Are you sleeping?	No.
Yes.	How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.
He's somewhere#	Thanks, I see him#
Boys, this gets nobody nowhere - you're over excited, Steve and -	Don't apologize for me, Frank!
I could think of better places to meet her, instead of here.  He lives on the whole top floor.	I doubt that it matters any more.
Sidney is a liar!	Who said Sidney?
No!  NO!  Don't touch me!	Susan!#
Mac!  I don't want this man at my table#	I have a message from your sister.
Uh huh.	When?
Are you listening?	How does it matter who's sister? The main thing, they're through and -
Talk to her, Sidney#	Talk to her yourself#
It's nice, Sidney, that you give me this tip#	- He's got them on him.
Sidney#I#I don't do this sort of thing#	What sort of thing?
That's the third time he's called today.	He wants me to break a leg?
You ought to be used to me by now.	I'm used to you#
If that's for me, tear it up!	Take a top coat.
What's the matter?	Nothing#
I swear, Sidney, I can't help it - sometimes I wonder what I see in you#	That's no way to talk#
Why me#?	Why not you?
You're talking very fast.	Well, I'll tell you what - excuse me for breathing, will ya?  How do you like it?  He comes to my office and -
And I'm sorry for you, too, Sidney. You're going down with the ship.	What ship?
I tried to reach you twice -	What do you do for that hundred a week.  Fall out of bed?
You haven't told him yet#	I'm telling him in the morning after breakfast.
Hello, Steve.  I'm glad you could come.	Why did you call me?
No!  I'm saying that for your sake you have to make a clean break with your brother!	But, please, Steve, please - one step at a time!  I was born only yesterday!#
Please# let# the kids# go#	Shut up!  SHUT UP!!  Motherfucker!  It's all your fault!  IT'S YOUR FAULT!!
My God.	Now listen to me very carefully.
Look, whatever you want me to do, I'll do.  I just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?	No one must follow your work.
No good.	Let me try mine.
I'm right here.  I'm fine.  What's the dog's name?	Max.
Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right?	Right.
Swear.	What?
Everything.	Cool.
Excellent.	Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.
Not even of dying?	No.
I'll deal with the police.	Remember what I said, you can't#
Drive for a minute.	Where you going?!
We don't have much time.	What?
No!	I'm sorry, John.
It must end here# or I am the future.	I order you not to!
Easy money!	Where'd you learn all this stuff?
Out of the way, John!	No!  Don't kill him!
We're better off by ourselves.	But it's the only proof we have to the future# about the war and all that.
Mom?  You okay?	I couldn't# oh, God.  You# came here# to stop me?
It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.	I love you, John.  I always have.
Ready to rock?	Ready.
John, get out of the way!!	SHOOT!!!!
I know.  This is a dream, Sarah.	Oh.  Yeah.  They# make me take this stuff#
I must be destroyed.	Can you get us in there, past security?
Is it safe for them here?	Take your kids.  Go to a hotel.  Right now. Don't pack.  Let's go.
Are you afraid?	Yes.
Where do you stand on all this?	On all what?
What does he mean, too correct?	I don't know.
Don't see me to my door, there's no need.	But I promised your mother.
Okay, let's see. How long were you in the camp for?	Three months.
I made no deal!	I don't buy that.
If it's too hot, open your tie.	I wish to say something.
Do you know what that is?	Of course I know what that is.
Show me.	Show you?
Great catch, kid. The boy runs off.	So. You wanted to see me.
And ask him about his private life.	His private life?
So, you never heard of him.	Nope.
You can't to that#	Wrong.
What do you think?	Great.
Great.	You're a big help.
Do you understand?	Yes.  Don't hurt me.
This is a mistake.  I haven't done anything.	No. But you will.  It's very important that you live.
There's so much#	Tell me.  Just start at the beginning.
I caught one, back there.	Caught one?  You mean you got shot?
We gotta get you to a doctor.	It's okay.  Forget it.
What's he like?	You trust him.  He's got that strength.  You'd die in a second for John.
Sleep.  It'll be light soon.	Okay.  Talk some more.
Thanks a lot.	What's that?
That's where we're going.	Why?
Let's go.  Time to move out.	Fuck you!  Let go of me!
Is this enough?	Yes.  And I don't want to know where you got it.
I don't think I like this.	You're not supposed to.
Here, drink some of this#	Lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  Maybe I should see the #bodies.
That stuff's two hours cold.	I know.
I'm so sorry.	Please, don't do that#
Pardon me# Miss# ?	Oh, no# you.
Excuse me, I need to explain#	Don't explain.  Fuck off.  Goodbye.
What's with him?	I don't know# he fell.
Do you know what to do?	I don't think he's breathing.
Oh, God# !	Don't just stand there, get help!
This is nuts.	What is your problem?
Let's talk to whoever can get this over with#	Hold on#  They want your driver's license number.
You've got to be kidding.	What# is# happening# ?
I was trying to tell you# it's a game.	A game?
See you around.	Where are you going?
Don't even think about it.	Why not?
I'll wait.	It's not like anyone could actually open it.
There goes a thousand dollars.	Your shoes cost a thousand dollars?
A fresh shirt#	If this was my office, I wouldn't keep that closed.
Goodnight.	I don't think I've ever spent this much time with someone who didn't even ask my name.
What are you doing here?	Can we talk?
Didn't think I'd ever see you again.	Come here#
What is it?	Is this you?
Want anything to drink?	You?
Take the picture out.	What's wrong?
What are you doing# ?	Get out.
What did you say?	I didn't say anything.
It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive.	It might be best if we didn't talk.
Who is it?	What do we do?
Who is it?	What do you mean?  I checked them myself.  I made the calls#
What are you doing here?	I'm back from the dead.
What do you think you're doing?	You tell me# I want to know who's behind this.  Who did this to me# how, why# ?
It could have been any asshole with a couple hundred million in the bank.	Call them, tell them to get the boss up here.  Tell them I'll kill you#
They won't#	They will!  You tell them if they don't come now, I will shoot you!
Where'd you get that# ?	# what# ?
What the fuck are you# ?	Where'd you get that gun?
He's got a gun.  Everyone, he's got a real gun up here!  Real situation!  # damn it#	What are you doing?
No!  You take another step, I'll shoot!  They're trying to kill me#	You're wrong.  You're about to make the biggest mistake of your life. Put that gun down.
Don't move, you bitch# !	I have to show you#
I have to get to the airport#	Where are you going in such a hurry?
You look good.	So do you.  And to think I was worried#
For you.	You shouldn't have.
Tell me you'll call.	Okay.
I thought you'd like this.  Best thing I ever did.  If you don't want to do it, DON'T#	I'll call them, okay?
Tell me where we're going.	Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
The phone's dead.	Really?
How did those# ?	You're part of it#
No!  You're one of them.  Of course, it makes perfect sense!	No, it doesn't!  Those keys were put there.  I didn't even know#
What?	This# ?  Oh, this is just# this is the bill.
Really?	Yeah.
They know you# you worked for them. You can get me in.	No, I can't.  I'm sorry and all, but#
Drive in.	What are you gonna do anyway?  You won't get your money back.
Where?	I told you, they hired me over the phone.  I never met anyone.
You know, these fit# perfectly.	They were my husband's.  My late husband# may he rest in peace.
I've been so lonely.	I can't tell you how not interested I am.
Thank you.	Have a nice day.
Is everything alright?	Fine.
What makes you ask?	I'm not sure.
Goodnight.  See you home.	Goodnight.  Where was she?
Pleasure to meet you, I'd like to see my brother, thank you.	Your brother.  Will you come with me?
What the fuck# ?!	Why are you following me?
Anything wrong# ?	Nothing.  Nothing at all.
I wasn't expecting you.	Wanted to wish you luck.  Not that you'll need it.
What's happened#	Follow me.
He hasn't called back.	What about the house?
Couldn't get the last ones.  You?	I did okay.
That could have been worse.	Yeah.
Luke, can I talk to you?	Sure.
Hey!  I heard screaming#	Luke.
Well, this lot is full!	He must have left.  Didn't like the looks of the place or something.
I didn't do it.	You could have.
Was sure she'd be in here.	Where in the hell can she be.
Are you working with her?	Mary, I'll meet you outside.
Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did it?	I don't know.
Someone is playing with you.	Why?
Come on.	No --
You know what he's really upset about?	What?
Maybe they're Mary's.	Mary came with me.
Is she asleep?	Yes.  But I promised I wouldn't let her alone the whole night.
What do you want?	Oh!  You scared me.
Why?	Why'd she kill herself?
I love this house.  I really love this house.	You're okay.
You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you?	Yes.  I've missed it.
If this was some sort of joke, I'm going to kill him.	You know it wasn't a joke, Theo.
Is it over?	No, it's getting worse.
Theo# Did you?	Maybe you did it yourself.
You want to move to New York, you want to move in with me?	I don't know, you know#
Are you sure?	I think so.
They're all in here.  All the ones he killed.  They're just children! We have to help them!	Come on!  Why are we waiting?
What'd you come back for, babe?	Just had to be sure.
Oh, Theo.  You know I don't have an apartment.	Then let's go get you one.
What's the matter?	Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
We think someone is here.	We think?
No.	Why not?
Hey.	Come over here.
How they goin', kid?	Not bad.
Same as last time -- the rest after.	Where do we go?
Where do you think he is, Mike.	We'll find him.
You broke last time.	Let him break - he likes to break.
Oh really?  Where you from?	England.  Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.
Man knows what he likes.	Lookin' good.
I didn't expect anyone.	No reason.
Who done it, then?	Huh?
I go to work, try to keep my life together, put all that shit behind me, man.  What d'you want from me.	I only asked.
What, tryin' to catch him with another bird?	That's what I thought, man.  But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else.
You should talk to Elaine.  That was her best friend.	She didn't write to me, did she.
No.  Not at all.  Do we?	Not me, man.
What are we standing on?	Faith.
Steady on.	You steady on, man.  What the fuck else did you do back there.
Why didn't you just kill him, you had the chance.	That would be too easy.
I've been wondering something.	Again?
What d'you say, Elaine?	Not much -- you?
Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time?	No, but I know what he means.
Why did you come here?	Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
Sort a few things out.	Been busy, have you.
Here, aren't you gonna let me in.	Try calling me again.
When did you get in?	Yesterday.  Afternoon.
Yeah, that's right.	I can never decide what I like better. Leaving home, or coming back.
Been away a lot.	Where else?
How much.	Five thousand.
She's nice lookin'.	So what.
How'd you get in here.	Walked.
He's expecting you?	I doubt it.
Hello there.	What are you doing here?
What kind of trouble are you in?	No trouble.
Pleasure.	Have we met?  There's something I can't quite --
What.	Tell me.
Hello, Ed.	Ann. Will you come in?
Oh, I know. Don't worry, Ed. I came to tell you#	Yes, Ann?
Yeah.	We've certainly missed you.
#or maybe I just haven't played 'em right, I don't know. But you're--	Pop doesn't like people smoking in here.
Sure# Sure, it's his house.	That's what he keeps telling me.
#Was that a pass?	Maybe.
No problem!	Way out of line.
#You bring a check?	Cash.
#Were you in the service, Ed?	No, Dave, I wasn't.
#Ed, I#	What is it, Dave?
#Oh, Jesus.	#Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
Please, Ed.	But it's#
#Dave?	Come on in.
#What's so damn strange about that?	I didn't say a word.
Honey.	How are you?
I don't know what's going on. I--	What happened to you?
Should I# should I tell you why?	You don't have to tell me anything.
#My books used to be perfect. Anyone could open them up, make sense of the whole goddamn store.	Honey#
OK, how did you know?	I# just knew. A husband knows.
Will anyone else say they knew?	I don't know. I don't think so.
Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at home.	Oh, hell. Drink?
Coffee, Ed?	I'm fine. Thanks.
Ed, how're you holding up?	I'm OK, Walter, thanks.
#Huh?	Haven't I seen you up in ladies' wear?
#Ed?	Huh?
#You sure, Eddie?	Yeah, yeah--go home.
Frank.	Huh?
#How you today, Ed?	OK.
This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together!	Yeah.
They're just people like you and me, Ed. Remember that.	Uh-huh.
#We goin'?	Huh? No.
I don't understand.	He's the dead guy.
Hello!	Hello.
Yes, sir.	Could you come with me please?
Forget it!	Calm down.  I found it!
Fifteen# what's next?	Eight to the right!  Look!  I found it!
The body?	What's left of it.
If you don't mind, this could be important.	You're kidding.
Look.  It's some kind of letter.	May I see that?
Lieutenant!  It's me.	What is it?
It's still back there!	I know.
What's that?	All right everybody, hold up!
Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?	I'd say we're in its home.
Come back and get me.	We will.
You work here?	Yes, I do.
We're not supposed to go back there.	Chicken.  This is a great short cut.
Quiet!	What is it?
They've got something.	Keep the light up.  I can't see.
Stop!	Holy mother, what is that?
There's something out there!  Let's go get it now!  That's why we came down here, isn't it?	He's right.  Follow me.
Oh# my# God!	Quiet.
Oh no.  I smell it.	Keep the animal quiet.
Somehow, when all this happened# I knew it would come back to John.  Is he really dead?	Maybe not.
Where would we find it?	I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.
What happened?	I don't know.
That's not what I saw.	All right.  If you're positive.
Dr. Green#	I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there?
You're not.  Where is it?	Gone.
Hide quickly!	What are you going to do?
What is it doing?	It's scared of me.
We have to try and draw it off!	How?
Help someone!	Oh God!  Help!
You smell that?	It's coming.  Run.
Just like John.  He won't listen.	I have to shoot.
Close up?	No, hold back#
We're not watching the sea.	Why would we--
He doesn't care.	Do it!
Welcome.	Thank you.
Nothing was real.	You were real.  That's what made you you so good to watch.
How can they have a child?	It's not gonna be his, you idiot.
It's okay.  I probably wouldn't talk to me either.	I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.
Actually, I'm free Sunday.	Now.
It's beautiful!  What are you waiting for?	I#I can't.
I've got to talk to you.	Sorry, I'm way behind.
What's that?	It's a surprise.
Well, what do you think?	They're#  perfect.  Thank you.
I was hoping we could have a special evening.	I won't be late.
Where have you been?	I've been thinking--
This'll pass.  Everybody thinks like this now and then.  Come to bed.	I think I'm going to stay up for a while.
I have to talk with you.  But not here.  Let's go for a walk.	I'm sorry, I'm late.
Let's go now.	What?!
Stop this now.  I'll do it.  I swear.	Do something#
How are you, Mother?	Well, I made it through another night.
They're coming.  Any minute.	Who?
Do you live around here?	Yeah.
Not supposed to talk about it.	You're not supposed to talk about it? Who told you that?
I think you better tell us.	We don't even know you.
You've got something to show me.	Yes.
You follow me out here for a reason?	Yeah, I did.
Those people were already dead.	Before the bomb went off?
I think you're full of shit.	Do you?
See this bullshit#? Somebody knows I'm talking to you.	Not according to the men in blue.
How can I reach you?	You can't.
You told me you had answers.	Yeah, well I don't have them all.
Now what?	It's locked?
Had you.	No you didn't.
Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.	All I told them was the truth.
I wake you?	No.
You think they went left?	I don't know why I think they went right.
What do you think it is?	I have no idea.
What are you doing?	Come on!
Where'd they go?	I don't know.
Cold#	Hang on. I'm going to get you out of here.
We've got to keep moving.	Where are we?
Are we being watched?	I'm not taking any chances.
Why are you telling me this?	I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
Let me out. Stop the car.	Driver.
We've been over this a dozen times.  No.	Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?
Don't bring it home in this.	Okay.
Is it cold in here?	What happened?
Damn him.	What's wrong?
What happened?	What difference does it make#?
Wait#	Like hell "wait."
He wants us to follow.  The little boy#	Little boy?!  That's him!
Where the hell are we?	Carl, do you know?  Like on a map#
COME ON!	I can't leave him!
They're hungry.	I got it.
Thank you.	No problem.
You liked him?	He's beautiful#
What now?	's broken.
I have done this, you know.  Been inside.	No.
Nervous?	Absolutely.
Is she alright?	Yes.  But you're going to sit down right now.  I have to#
I need it.	Now?
How is she?	Pregnant.  Thanks for asking.
You sure you want to go through with this?	What else do we do?!
Right here.	Next time, tell me, okay?
Thank you.	Sit down.
Well, I saw you at the funeral.	I'm so sorry, I didn't notice much.
No.	He has a little dog.
Yes. They said it wasn't the driver's fault. Harry often said what a careful driver he was.	He was Harry's driver?
I don't know. They didn't answer.	I was told there were only two men there.
Harry?	Yes. He moved his head, but the rest is good, isn't it?
Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?	Just another part I've got to learn.
Do I#	Well you read this.
Tell me about him.	Tell you what?
#to steal my girl.	Where is she?
Oh, that was many years ago.	Tell me more.
#and buried him.	Anna.
Seemed like a good idea.	It's just what he used to say.
That's Harry's place, isn't it?	Yes.
Let's go away.	What's the matter?
I thought you were going to go away. Aren't the police after you?	I don't know.
I'm going back home.	Why?
#you know.	He told you, didn't he?
Are you going, too?	Oh#
#is there?	How did you know I would be here?
Harry.	I'm sorry.
What is on your mind? Why did you hide?	Hide? Can't a fellow have a drink?
Here, it will be cold on that train.	I shall be all right.
Did he say anything about me - tell me?	Oh, the usual things#
#parents.	Yes.
Do you know this man?	I have never seen him.
I said another man was buried in his place.	Where's Harry?
Here we are. You'll be all right here, Miss.	I don't#
See much of him before that?	Once in a while.
#to him.	What are you trying to say?
Get the next plane.	As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
So would I.	Bring him in.
#be responsible for you in the streets.	I'm not asking you to.
#in the morning.	Thank you. Excuse me.
A girl of spirit.	She's right. It's none of my business.
Didn't I?	You all did.
What time is it?	Two thirty.
Wait a minute - let me out.	Well, there's not much time.
It's a military hotel.	I'm so glad to have met you, sir. I've read quite a few of your books.
Shall I go over there, sir?	No, no. Leave them for a while.
#excuse me.	Please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.
#his number.	I'll look it up for you.
Well, yes. I suppose that is what I meant to say.	Of course, of course, of course.
Hello, Harry.	Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
What can I do, old man, I'm dead, aren't I?	You can help her.
#exactly who did you tell about me? Hmm?	I told the police.
Well, I've got quite a lot on my mind.	You wouldn't do anything.
What do you want me to do?	You can get somebody else#
#this way.	What do you want?
We came out of his place like this, and were walking this way. A friend of his called to him from over there. Harry went across and from up there came the truck. It was just about here.	Here?
#were of you.	What did he say?
#the best way one can, you know.	What's the name of this girl?
Not yet.	But you will.
Speak English?	English?
Already gone.	Who?
Excuse me!	Yes, sir.
Happened#Yes happened right down there.	You saw it?
#give evidence.	Who else?
There was a third man - he didn't give evidence.	You don't mean that doctor?
I have no evidence. I saw nothing. I said nothing. It's not my business.	Well make it your business.
Yes, it is.	I am not a bad man.
I thought there was something funny about the whole thing.	Funny?
That's all you meant?	What else?
#this time.	Yes.
Excuse me.	Yes?
Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.	Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.
I don't know - I'm American.	So?
Everyone ok?	We're ok.
She is gone!	What happened?
She just went under the water. She was pulled under. Oh God, I don't see her.	Was there a shark? Did you see a shark?
Did you sleep well?	Not too bad.
Hi.	Hi there. Here, take a look.
So from there to there?	We swim.
Have you told someone?	No.
We lost our key.	Where did you lose it?
Fucking Danny, man#	He's an asshole.
What do you think you're doing?	Who the fuck are you?
Bring your friends#. We're not his friends.	Then I won't bring you#.
You coming?	We'll go to the country sometime, okay?
Do we have to listen to this shit?	Yes.
What do you care?	I don't, but#
Yeah, but not on the letters.	Why the fuck not?
You write that?  Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you.	I have a job.
When can I see you?	You can't.
Your father??	He's at a home out here.
I'm coming to your room tonight.	No.
I want to learn to read it.	Why?
Put something on. You're not supposed to be naked in front of it.	Why not?
I thought there were people here#.	I'll go look#.
Is it okay if I record this?	No# Yeah, fine, go ahead# So what's this about? Is this about me?
How have things been going?	Fine.
What about chicken?	That's meat.
What are you doing here?	I just came to get some stuff. I'll be out in five minutes.  He doesn't want me around.
Ah, Jesus Christ, Danny, how can you wear that thing?# You know what it means? To your people#	They're not my people#.
Which was his room?	Number ten.
Shut up. Fuck you#.	What#?
Open it up.	Here#
Oh, what is this shit?	Keep driving. Don't slow down.
Who'd you kill?	Four. But no one this important.
You missed on purpose.	I didn't. I told you, I can't --
And what did you do?	What are you trying to say?
SO THEY SHOT HIM! SO HE WAS DEAD. SO WHAT. HE'S WORSE THAN DEAD NOW. HE'S A PIECE OF SHIT#	Okay, that's it. You're going back to --
Where do you think you're going?	#We have nothing to learn from these people. They should learn from us.
It's Friday#.	Do I give a shit?
Are you out of your mind?!	I was just trying to make a point. If --
Do you think I#	Danny, please, we don't want to know.
Are you going to keep it?	Yes.
Did you tell him?	Not yet# I'm waiting for the right moment.
I tell you she's mine!	Hello!
Where did you two meet?	In a lake.
He looks strange, doesn't he? Like a baby that just learned to walk.	Have you known him long?
Huh?  Well listen to him!  Do you hear that?	No.
Well, good night, then#	You going to sleep here, all by yourself?
You risk your life when you cross the street.	Damn it!  Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
# Not yet.	Don't.
Is he alright?  What happened?	The fool was asleep!  If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with?
Where did you get that?	"That"!  This is not a "that"#
Is he here?	He's training.
You don't mind if I go instead, do you?	No#
Why?	Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
# So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask.  Am I right?	Yes, of course.  Lots of questions.
Well, what are they?	I'm sorry# I don't know how to ask the questions.
No, no!	Not at all!
Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions.	Ah ha.  You finally want to know about women.
Why?	If we don't# I'm going to beat you.
No, I have to ask you a favor#  You're the only one who'll understand.	# I'm listening.
Here#  Here#	What is it?
Can I come in?	No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep.
Anybody can have a bad day!	I've had many# when the sea doesn't want you.
# How long was I asleep?	Long enough to die.  Listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay?
You were right.	# I was right about what?
# Push me back in the water#	I can't.
Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?	Who?
I recognize you.	We saw each other a little while ago.
Thanks for helping with the bag.  It looks great!	I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?
You're going to be very busy these days aren't you?	I don't know# why?
I thought you'd be at the dinner.	It's too loud for me.
# No?	No?  Huh?  Yes, of course!!
How can you tell it's a female?	# The way she moves.
She's not like the others.  She can't stand to be away from the sea.	How do you know that?
I'm going back home.	Why?
How are you?	I got fired.
So have I.  # Hello?	I'm still here.
Hello?	It's me again.
I'm being a pain, huh?	# Not at all.
Why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here.	You'll understand.
What?	# Nothing.
You've got to tell me what happened?	I saw how it has to be.
Promise me one thing.	Anything.
Why don't you ask me?	What?
Uncle Louis!	No, no.  It's true.  When I was in New York, oh boy!  Before my accident, you understand? 
Good.  That way I'll see more of you# Where are you going to stay?	Well# here.
Well?	What?
# Since eight o'clock last night#!  You're in love.	Don't be a jerk.  There's no such thing as love at first sight.
Wait!  Professor#?	# Yes?
I'll go see how he's doing.	Let him sleep.
What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.	C'mon follow me.
So, now what?	Now we wait for Santa to make his next move.
Want to get a drink?	Sure. Why not.
What was that!?	I said, do you come here often!?
What!?	I said, yeah, about once a week!
Sorry. I'm better with men.	Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing.
I wasn't too over the top?	No, it was the perfect level.
What day is it?	It's Friday.
Is someone with you -- can I get you a drink?	Why not?
Is he in love with you?	I don't know 
This is for "mama and the kids."	What about me?
Then what do you do?	I sleep it off.
Now I know I didn't hurt nobody when I was drunk - -	Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
Sure!	No. I'm serious about this.
I'm sick.	Here have a cigarette. He was only kidding.
What's left of him.	Where? Where did you find it?
What did they say before the bad card came up?	You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
Well -- did he give you a lot of money?	Who?
Cut.	What are you doing that for?
Don't look at it!	Let me see it 
The death card - -	Maybe not - cards mean different things different times --
Love is different for different people.	I suppose so. I suppose it will be different for us, too  when everyone knows. Then we will be just like other people.  But these last weeks will always be our secret  a lovely secret to remember all our lives.
Well, I'd best be off.	I want to ask you something.
Doc -- something you said the other day --	Yes?
Come to look around?	More or less.
What are you getting at?	Nothing much -- just that it might not be a cat this time.
Are you all right?	Now look what you've done.
I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad.	And I suppose you don't feel bad!
You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --	I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.
As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.	What! You can't be --
No. No, thanks.  Now we've got to do it ourselves.	We will 
That right.	Will you please come with me?
I will of course do my best to hang onto it.	Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
Thank you for coming. Come in and close the door, will you?	Last night you upset my sleep. Tonight my social life. We have two minutes. My dinner guests are waiting.
Do you think we let him get away with the murder of my brother?	We? You and your parents killed your husband?
So you did talk about it, huh?	On# Once#  Once# What are we# you going to do?
Damn it! You can fucking walk away from this!	It up to you whether they walk or not.
They never let me go. And you end up in more trouble than you know for helping me.	You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
On the bed!	What#?
Who the money man?	Who?  Martin# He Martin#
Ever seen him before?	No# No#  I swear#
You sure you passed on my message?	I certainly did, sir#
Problems?	Is my money in there?
Let go.	I don know what your problem is, but#
Am I supposed to know him?	Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.
Five to three. Youe early.	Should I come back in five minutes?
The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?	Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still#
Now, can you stand up?  Can you use your legs and stand up?	I# How long have I been here?
Welcome to the club.	Excuse me?
He didn't tell you to cut all your hair off#!	How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!
What did they say?	Uh# they said# they will think about it.
What's going on?!	They've started the battle without me!
Alright# I promise to rest if you promise# to go back to the battle.	I promise#
If you really want to help me, there's one thing you can do.	Tell me#
Will you at least let me stay with you?	It would not be the same without you.
I am ready now#	Just give me a moment and then you'll be free#
Go onto the next question.	Good advice for the French, not for the English!  Do you think God hates the English?
Do you have a sword?	Quite a few.
Are you alright?  Did they hurt you?	No no, I'm fine, really#
Quick -- hide in here#	What about you?
What was my mission?  To help my country?  But how could I do that? I was only a poor girl who knew nothing about riding or making war# so I decided to wait and not to speak to anyone about it.	You did well#
Wait, wait#	For what?
Well#?  Shall we go?	Not yet.
Clear?	Perfectly.
Do you know how to count?	Of course I do?  Bring them up!
Who told you to wear men's clothes?	The clothes are not important#
Stop it!  What are you doing?	Nothing# just taking his teeth.
Besides, what about these#?	That's different# I mean# we were fighting for a# for a cause!
Yeah#	Here -- take this instead.
So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??	Hey, my friend!  I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?	God knows, but it was a bad idea!
What have you done to me?	I -- I -- I#
Who# who are you#?	I am that I am.  You don't like my face?  Maybe you prefer this one#
What are you doing out here?	I might ask you the same question.
Oh?  And just because you realize now, everybody else should forgive you?!	I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!
They won't come anyway.	What do you mean, they won't come?
I'm not lying, I# I can't remember# leave me alone!	Oh?  You can't remember?  Let me help your memory#
No!  I don't want to know anymore! Leave me alone!  I didn't kill that man!	Oh no?  How about this one?
There's nothing for me to do here anymore# I don't belong here I want to be with Him now#	Do you think you are ready?
You think you are ready now?	Yes, my lord.
And what about your other friends# you don't like playing with them?	Oh yes, I play with them# lots#
So# everything sounds# wonderful?	Yes, it is.
Beautiful.	And what does he say to you?
I heard about your sister, and I# understand your pain#	Why did she have to die?
Someone you know?	Yes.
I'm going to get a doctor.	You can't, it's too dangerous.
How long have you been married?	Just over a year.
When's your baby due?	Christmas.  This is not a good time to have children. But then#
What did I tell you?	What are you doing?
Will I still be able to play?	Let's find out.
To tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.	How will we sleep?
It's not going to be very comfortable.	I'll be fine.
Must feel better this side of the wall.	Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
Get your things together, you have to leave!	What's happened?
I'm on the run!	What's happened?
Have you seen this?	What, I'm working, what?
What's happened?	Oh my God, it's terrible, you've got to do something, oh my God!
And suppose they take the table away?	What d'you mean, take the table away?
What's this about?	Sit down, have tea, I'll start lunch when the girls get back.
Mama, that was a great dinner.	It certainly was.
No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --	That makes a change.
It's not funny.	Well, you know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.
What's the matter? Are you sick?	Hungry.
How long have you been here?	Since last night. I was pleased to see you.
I tried your friends. They're not at that address any more.  But.	You made contact?
Pack, darling, get your things, pack.	Where are we going?
What's happening?	We're getting out.
I don't know how to thank you.	Don't thank me. Thank God. It's His will that we should survive. Well. That's what we have to believe.
Watch your feet!	Watch your feet!
Careful! Watch his hand.	Watch his hand
They want more money. They are trying to make two days out of it?	No, no they know another track - to the side of this.
I'll have to come and hear you play. what do you play.	Nothing just yet
She wants to see what you can do.	I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
Oh no, it can't come now.	It must come.
She wants it to come.	Yes and so do I, but there are too few of us here to carry it. TOO - HEAVY
Hello, then.	Hello.
And when is the next lesson?	Tomorrow.
Give it to me!  Please.  I gotta know it's all there!	You just sit tight, old man.  We're gonna have to get you to a doctor.  I'll call a cop.
You wanted by the law or somethin'?	Naw, it's okay.
#It's the only reason I ain't quit before now.	What?
Looks all right.  It's big enough and off the street.	I don't know.  This is kinda short notice.  I'm not sure we can get it all done by Saturday.
You gonna stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat?	I picked something up on the way.
He's not as tough as he'd like to think.	Neither are we.
You just worry about your end, kid.	If we ever get to it.
You think he'll show?	Did he say he wouldn't?
You beat him, kid.	You were right, Henry.  It's not enough# But it's close.
All you gotta do is show up with some money and look like a fool.	I also gotta win.
I can't lay that off in time.  We lose a bet that big, it could break us.	If ya win it could make ya, too.
My end was only one.	Then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere.
You got a back door to this place?	No.  What's wrong with the front?
What does this guy want?	He'd like to kill me.
I, ah#thought you might wanna come out for a while.  Maybe have a drink or somethin'.	You move right along, don't ya.
I don't even know you.	You know me.  I'm just like you# It's two in the morning and I don't know nobody.
You sure it'll be one of these two?	No.  They're just the only ones we know of.
Ain't seen you in months, boy. Thought maybe you took a fall.	Naw, just a little hard times, that's all.  It's all over now.
You should always look to the back too, kid.	I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
Well, what did I tell ya?	You're a lucky man, all right.
What happened?	I didn't get the bet down in time.
You want a drink or something?	No.
Sorry.  I don't know anything about it.	Come on, gimme a break.
What's your next step, Nick?	Right back to California.  We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
What's the matter, darling # not sweet enough?	It's all right.
Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.	But tonight is Christmas Eve!
What could happen to him, darling? You mustn't worry#.  What is it?	Just a minute#
Now don't say that -- he's just off somewhere working.	I can't find him.  I've tried everything.  I thought you might know.
Any luck?	He's just around the corner.
What?	Nothing.
How are you?	Another young man.
Well!	That is, if it's all right with you.
Mind if I look around?	Help yourself.  Oh, Tom, show this gentleman# 
Oh, Andy.	Don't cry.
This is a pretty dead bunch, isn't it?	You're high enough.
Darling, don't cry.  Please.  I know it's terrible.  But isn't it really better this way?	Oh, Andy, Andy!
What is it? Has he found him?	Do you know where he's living?  Oh#.  Well, at least I'm glad he's all right.  Thank you for calling. Goodbye.
What is it?	Nothing.
That isn't true.  It was about your father.  Where is he?	He's all right.  Isn't that enough?
Mother #.  you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.	I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
Oh!	Now do you believe me!
Mother!	And I'll give then proof!
How are you?  Here.  Get under this.	Thanks#  we're taking your cab.
Is your father still in there?	He's waiting for you.
He didn't do it -- Nick!	What do you mean?
You know, we know each other.	Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
Your father?	No.  The lawyer -- I'm going to see him.
Come on in.	I've got to see you alone!
Dead?	He's been dead for three months.
It's been the same one for three months.	Forgive me.  How are you?
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.	Yes, she would.
Wait a minute.  When is it going to be? I'm leaving town tonight.	Where are you going?
How's your brother?	He's all right.
Like all the rest of us.  Has this fellow#  #has he seen the whole family?	And he still wants to marry me!
Poor Dad, does that still bother you?	Only in bad weather.
I never saw him before.	What's he want of you?
This gun yours?	No.
You oughtn't to play this trick on me.  Running out when I was giving you time to rest up before I asked you those questions.	You mean about that gun?
Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?	Man to man, I'm not.
Well, what'd you think?	I think we're on the right track.
Get anything?	She's ready to talk.  It won't do any harm, though - to find out where he is.
What're you doing here?	I'll take care of him.
Are you kidding?	No.
I said he hadn't written me.	Oh, then you did hear from him?
There are a few things we want to check up on.	I see.
That's all right.  Well, we'll be going.	Goodbye.
You did!	That's nothing.  I saw him myself.
That's ridiculous.	Let him have his say out.
Good morning --	Good morning, Lieutenant -  Sorry.
But he's interested!	I don't mind telling you I'd rather have you working with us than against us.
You'd done better to have told me that in the beginning.  Where were you the afternoon she was knocked off?	You don't think I had anything to do with it?
What are you going to do?	Just what I said I'd do.
and there she was lying dead.  The police said she'd probably been killed about ten minutes before I got there.	I thought you said you weren't going there.
We're just having a little drink.	So I see.
Who's that man?	He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.
I want that money right now, or I'll hand you over to the police.	Go ahead!
That's a fine thing to throw up to me after all I've been to you#.	Hello #.  give me #.  Well #.  ?
Did you get my money?	I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.
One hundred#  two hundred# three#	Never mind.
Thanks, and goodbye.	What'll I do if something comes up?
How are you?	I hate to bother you when you're laid up.
I tell you -- he didn't do it.	They'll want more than your word for that.
You did# where?	Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.
What's that?	This is your party.
So it's you he was after!	Hello, baby.
Pretty girl.	If you like 'em like that.
Come on -- relax --  Give them a drink.	We need ice.
I'd better order some food.  That sounds like an interesting case.  Wouldn't you like to take it?	I haven't the time.  I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.
Isn't that my drink?	What are you drinking?
Where did you get that?	She brought it in.  Trying to make me believe she did it.
Nick!  Nick!  Are you asleep?	Yes.
Everybody says you were a grand detective.	They were kidding you.
That poor girl is in a tough spot.	There's nothing I can do to help her.
But it's Christmas now.	Breakfast.
Nick!  Nick!  There's someone to she you,	That's great.  I was afraid I'd have to go to sleep.
You're a fine watch dog.	He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
I never saw that before.	No.  It's a Christmas present.
Hello# send him up.	Who's that?
Well, that's that.  Stay there, Nick!	It's not going to hurt me to get up.
This may be a little rough - you'd better let us go alone.	Catch me letting you go alone!
How long has he been dead?	Couple of months anyway.
I'm going to tell her.	Hey# hey.  Don't do that.
I can't wait any longer.  Tell me, do you think one of them did it?	Yes.
Is that true?	I don't know.
Nick Charles here?	Yes.  Nick!
I'm sorry#  but#	Two weeks work gone for nothing.
Where are you going?	Home!
Paper.	It's a fortune box.
What are we going to do!?	We're going to keep driving.
What kind of mine?	I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
Ready?	Yeah.
I don't want to see people killed any more than you.  But we try to help out we die, and all we do is die.	We can't just go off and--
Where'd they go?	I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--
And they can't fly around out there forever.	So we wait.
You ready?	All right.  I'll go up, then you send up the gold and--
It'll be too dark to make our way back now.  Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light.	What about the gold?
What happened?	I told you.  He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us.
Stop it!	I told you; don't push me around.
Says he wanted food.  Liar.  He wanted the gold.	How's he going to want the gold?  He couldn't even know we had it.
You're out of your mind.	He's an enemy soldier.
We been down this road.  I told you how it is.  Unless you feel like there's something you want to do about it#	What if I do?
I'm the one's got the big stick.	Suppose I don't go for that?
Just keep quiet.	I have to answer him.
Give it to me!	If I give it to you, will you let us go?
Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.	There might be something in there.
What!?  What!?	I did it!  I got the box open.
Don't even.  You're not going to show me that tired map.	Wait.  Wait.
Now this is war.	Roger that.
But that's the great thing about Gold.  A little goes a long way.	You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold?
Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up!	We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
She okay?	Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine.
What?	I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
SAY IT!	I got that#sir.
Hey#hey!  Slow up.  You don't have to go so fast.	Faster we get there, faster we get back.
I'm gonna#I'm just gonna stop for a little water.	Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
What!?	Mine.
What?	Mine.  Land mine!
Oh, God!  Oh God!	Just be cool.
My leg is falling asleep.	It's not falling asleep.  You've only been standing there for three minutes.
You're going to be fine.	You're not going to let me die, are you!? Don't let me die!
You're not losing trust, are you?	Just figure it's my map, I ought to hang on to it.
I don't hear any--	Shut up and listen!
Don't!	It's a fire fight.
Where is it?  Where'd it go?	Stay low.
What are we going to do?  What the hell are we going to do?	We're not going to do anything.
If they land--	If they land, we can take them.  If they don't land, then we've got nothing to worry about.
A whole lot of nothing.	So where do we start?
What are you doing?	What does it look like I'm doing?
Wait.	What?
What?	We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
All right.  You go up, I'll send up the gold, then follow.	Yeah.  Yeah, that'll work.
What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?	We'll find our way.
No.	What do you mean no?  They can fly us home.
I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.  I'm glad it didn't come to that.	Yeah.  Well, me too.
Sorry.	Damn.
We can't just sit here.  We've got to start moving, so pick.	You sure you want me too?
I pick that way.	Okay.  Then we go this way.
Can't you--	I don't have a weapon.
Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going to kill me.  Kill them!	I just said I would.  I don't think I--
I didn't say that.  I never said--	Me?  I say you don't have enough brains to be stupid.
Can you ride a horse?	No, but I figure now's a real good time to start.
Which way do we go!?	We go this way.
Well?	A car's got to come along sooner or later.  When it does, we jack it.
Come on.  You're going to get us in trouble.	It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.
What is this?	Now you need me.
He says it's a box.	Yeah, you're funny.
And you're the guy who's going to open it.	I could.
You get it yet?	Naw, nothing.
We#we could go home with something else.	What?
God!  I don't believe I'm doing this.  I don't.	Yes!
If there's gold.  If!	You know what I'm doing with my half?
I thought we were dead.	Yeah, well, we're not.
How long we going to keep this up.	Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
So?	We have to do something.
It's got a bottom.	Guess we know what the next stop is.
You down?	Yeah, we're down.
What the hell are you doing!?	I think we found something.
Maybe we should give him some water.	All last night he could have been--
Maybe we ought to#you know, bury him. Say some words over him.	You want to say some words?
I'm not hungry.	Well it's fixed, so you'll have to eat it.
No, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.	What's the matter with you?
What's this?  Why did you change it?	You've seen enough.
I don't know.	Don't go.
Then why did you bring it up?	I didn't.  You asked me about the card.  You're going to get us into trouble.
I haven't done anything.	Don't be so sure.
Look, food!	That's not food.  Can't be food.
What time is it?	What?
I can't go on like this.  I can't#.  I don't just sit around and watch people.  If I make a mistake, it's all over.  You see it every day.  Do you want to see me taken away in pieces?	I don't want to lose you.
What are you doing?	I don't know.
They know.  They've been watching us.  I can feel it.	They don't know.
Wait!  I'll talk to him.	Ask him about the air.  He looks out of breath.
We must escape.  We have plans. We can leave.  We must wait until#	Incredible!
How far did you go?  Was it cold?	You have nothing to fear.  You're safe again.
I'm leaving.	What?
What?	Look!
What are you doing here?	I was lost.
Which way?	That way.
#it doesn't matter.  The rest of it just didn't happen.	What are you talking about. How do you know?  I need her!  I need her.  She needs me.  I've got to get to her.
This one has eyes.  Why did they leave your eyes? Could you ever#.	No!#.
That's not it.	No?
No#no you're wrong.	I'm only trying to help you.
I'm sorry.	What do you want?
Just look at all those people.	I thought of something#..
Yes	I did not accept any.  I#  I wanted# to.  But I didn't. You know I didn't.  Don't you?
So what were they doing here?	I don't know. You tell me?
What's up?	Where you guys at?
Good, now the other side.	Nothing.
What do you think?	Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
You got it.	We work fast enough for you?
Any word?	Nothing. Maybe they gave up, split town.
Alright!	We've created a monster.
Then why tell me?	People are dying.
What is that?	Security.
What's the matter?	Nothing# just tired.
No# No more killing.	Stay here.
Drop it.	Take him!
He is!	Look, it's important.
That's one more time than any of the rest of us have seen it.	Shit. We're fucked.
You okay?	Yeah, just a nick #
Mike#	Don't talk.
Nice to be here.	That feeling won't last long.
Sir#	I thought I told you--
What's this?	Report on the case so far.
No doubt about it--it's that secretary.	Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
Yes#?	Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame? 
Do you know my first name?	No. What is it? Tell me.
And do you know what I'd like to have you do with that check?	What?
Ah, let me have a little fun.	Please! 
Goodbye#	Goodbye.
Oh, no, it's the way you lead.	No, madame, it's the way you follow.
You've had your breakfast--oh, but of course you have.	Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early.  My little brother goes to school--  You see, Mother is dead.
Your bag?	Yes, my bag!
How much time?	An hour, two at most.
Holy shit.	Don't drop it Rose.
What?	That's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it.
I told you you wanted to take this call.	Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?
I make my own luck.	So do I.
You know I don't like that, Rose.	She knows.
But I was with him the whole time.	Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.
You're a good liar.	Almost as good as you.
You know somebody?	Of course not. That's not the point.  Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!
How you two doin'?	I don't know what she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along fine.
Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.	No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
The fall alone would kill you.	It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold.
HELP! HELP!!	I've got you. I won't let go.
Hello again.	Could I speak to you in private?
You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.	A mistake?
Where to, Miss?	To the stars.
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!	He couldn't have.
You have to go for help.	I'll be right back.
Will this work?	We'll find out.
I'm not going without you.	Get in the boat, Rose.
You jump, I jump, right?	Right.
I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it#	Well, that's the general idea, my dear.
Don't come any closer.	You had it the entire time?!
My God, Rose, what's gotten into --	Excuse me.
Rose, get in the boat!	Goodbye, mother.
Well--shall we go into dinner?	I'll join you later.
Good afternoon--	Glad to see you again.
I hope so.	That's a date. 
Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.	We'll save you a place at our table.
You're coming back--	That depends on how mother's feeling. You'll excuse me, gentlemen?
How about a little game later?	Fine--I'll be glad to.
Could I see you a minute?	Sure!  Excuse me.
I'm so sorry!	Want to take it back?
Like her paint job?	Very much--
Where have you been hiding?	Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
A little.	Sorry.
What are you thinking?	A lot of things I'd like to forget.
Don't kid me. I'm in no mood for it.	For once I'm dead on the level--  --crazy about you!
I'll change and be with you in ten minutes.	Make it five.
Well, I'll be--!!!	What's the matter?
You keep it-- 	Me!
Come in! 	Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
It's your deal.	It's a pleasure.
How's your mother feeling?	Much better--thank you--
I'm going to the show--	I'll go with you--
How about you?	No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
Hello, young fellow!	Coming to the pool for a swim?
Don't get yourself all worked up--	You keep out of this--  You admit you thought of killing him--how were you going to do it?
Here's your fifty.	Thanks. That makes us square.
Here you are, sir. 	What'll I say?
Where do you live?	In New York.
Just a minute--I don't think we need the word "Back" --Where is "Back"?	Back is in New York.
Now we get it down to two words--"next month."	Send that.
I'll say--how fast is this boat going?	Oh,--we're doing about thirty--
I can see where I won't talk much to you.	Nuts to you too!
Tell her you're on your way to France and will be back in four weeks.	That's fine.
Come on, get up.  That horse is carrying too much of a load.	Who won?
Oh, there you are--	That's right--you're the one I was looking for.  You'll excuse me.   How about you and I being alone?
Those kids seem to be getting along fine!--	It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
Well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it.	Are you happy?
Yes.	Very serious?
Is that one of the Who's Who?	No--He's probably one of the "Here's How."  Take it easy--the ocean's pretty rough today--
How much did you lose?	About twelve hundred.
All right--but what is there to face? It's finished.	You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
Don't, Lee--that's dead.	Let's see if I can bring it back to life.
Yes, Yes!	You didn't have a gun in your hand last night?
Congratulations.	Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
There you are, sir.	Thank you.
Well, I'll be a son of a sea cook!	What's the matter?
I'm all right.	You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
Nothin'.	Let me look at it.
Oh, my God#	Does it hurt?  A lot?  Good.
Listen, I want to talk to you.	Not now.  I don't have time.
He said to turn loose of him.	Well I'm not so go home.
Where'd you get that horse?	Beauty, ain't he?
Look, I don't want any trouble With you but that's my horse and I mean to have him back.  One way Or another.	Come and get him.
Hey, you smell that?  Smells like Something died.	Oh, Jesus, Johnny#
Look at that!  Yeah!  Come and get Some, boy!	No#
Let me, let me, yeah!  Die, you Bastard#	No#
Forget it.	Excuse me?
How you feeling, Doc?	Better.
Maybe I ought to go out there.	You will or you won't.  Don't look To me.  I'm going to sleep.
Doc#	Don't touch me, God damn it!  Just Don't touch me!  Come on#
Don't touch me!	Sorry#
You really look awful.	Not half as bad as I feel.
No.	What?
That was lovely!	You know you almost got us both Killed back there?
I have to go.	Wait!
Come up to the fire, honey.	I think I'll just lie down awhile
I ain't your brother, I ain't None of your damn brothers.  Move!	All right, run 'em off.
What'd you do that for?	So he can tell the story.
How you doin', boy?	Fine.  Better.
You were right.  It's nothin' like I thought.  I almost wish#	I know, kid.  I know.  Me too.
Dropped him, that was it.  Sorry If I made a worse mess for you.	I'm the one made a mess.  Made a Right fair mess of the whole thing.
I just got it fixed.	You're on.
You back that Queen again, you Son of a bitch, I'll blow you Right out of that chair!  Somethin' on your mind?	Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair.
We should get moving.	Doc's just in no kinda shape.
Still, I do miss her. I only wish she could have lived to see all this.	I can feel your pain.
#And what's that, my dear?	Sidney, perhaps we should leave this to -
Actually, I've never known you to do either# But -	- We all want what we can't have?
Your new car. 	- Four wheel drive?
Wait a minute -	Get them out of here. If he says one word, shoot him.
Paris?!? What are you doing here?	Is that any way to say hello?
Oh, James. I've missed you -	Is this another one of your games?
Don't you even miss me? Didn't I mean anything to you?	Nothing.
Do you feel better now?	Do you?
Paris -	Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
Just - say it. Say it just once.	One thing at a time. I'll see you in twenty minutes. Go.
# Does this do anything?	Depends what number you write.
Do I have to do everything around here?	I hope so.
If I were you -	- You're not.
# Do you have a gun?	What?
Wait here.	No. I'm going with you.
Not a lot of difference.	What do you mean?
Down?	Up.
Sometimes you just have to -	Don't say it.
Sleep well?	Next time, I do the driving.
What do you mean, you'd rather die alone?	I didn't say when I want to die -
Who's in charge here?	I am. What do you want?
Damn. It's doing it again.	What's wrong?
How is it now?	Seems to be back to normal, sir.
What is HE doing here?	I see you two have met.
Take the men. I can finish alone.	You come with me -  You stay here.
Oh, no.	Who is it?
Will it go off?	Maybe. Maybe not.
I pay my own way.	Since when?
Babe Brother, is that my shirt that you're wearing?	Yes.
Why in the hell didn't you help mama?	I told her I would if she would give me time.
I'll drive her to the hospital.	We will take her. You all stay here and watch Dad.
Why does he always pick on me?	He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.
You okay?	I'm okay. Go back to your friends.
Who is it?	Babe Brother.
Doesn't he look a whole of lot better?	Well, you look better than you did yesterday.
I don't want to wear out welcome, but you can stay in someone's heart longer than you can stay in their house. Come with us, boy. We are going to have a good time.	This would be a bad time for me to leave.
Your feet are cold.	Go back to sleep.
Do you want your coat? It's cold out here.	No, I'm too hot now.
It's good to be able to hear that.	You must have been really sick.
What, are you having another party?	You better come sit down. You are still sick.
Since this morning.	What happened to your hand?
I have someone I want you to meet.	I'll be right there.
Harry, you know everything.	You got to know everything, do everything, and be everything.
That smells like fresh coffee.	Let me get you a cup?
How is he doing?	As long as he keeps his throat clear, he is able to get some rest.
Good afternoon, ladies.	Good afternoon to you.
As God is my witness, I have never done anything to that woman.	You must have done something to her.
There is something that I always wanted to know. Tell me, how did those boys die?	Now who are we talking about?
You know the saying, "your heart is in your left hand."	Now I was trying to be nice, to make conversation, since we go back some.
We can't really bring another family in here with us.	Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.
Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?	No, I haven't seen him.
Andy!  I'm heading out the door.	But Mom, I can't find him!
I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I left him right there.	Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him.
I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.	But what if we leave them behind?
Everybody say, "Bye, house."	Bye, house.
Hey!  Wow!	What?  What is it?
Uh, let what?  I don't -- Uh, what do you mean?  Who?	I know Andy's excited about Buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.
THAT is Sid!	You mean that happy child?
Buzz!  Buzz, come back!	Go away.
C'mon, c'mon, that's it#	Where is it?  I don't see the --
Oh, come on, Buzz.  I#Buzz, I can't do this without you.  I need your help.	I can't help.  I can't help anyone.
Buzz!!  What are you doing?  I thought you were --	Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
Well, thanks for the ride.	Look out!!
Me?  No, no, no, no#  Are you?	Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?!
Hey!!	She's sick!
MOM!!  MOM!!	She's lying!  Whatever she says it's not true!
Wait just a minute.  What are you trying to pull?!	Nothing.
No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please!  You don't know what it's like over here!	Come on.  Let's get out of here.
They're getting bigger.	Wait!  There's a nice little one over there!
It's Sid!	I thought he was at summer camp!
Okay, we're on the last present now#	Last present!
Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY!	Sid!!!
Reach for the sky!!	Huh?
This town ain't big enough for the two of us!	What?!
I want to go home.	Home is where the heart is.
I won't do it because he wants me to do it, even if I want to do it.	Do what?  Oh, I see.
Who's there?	Let me in.
Can I come into bed with you for a little while, I feel terrible.	Well # yes. All right. But -
You are cold. Where have you been?	I finished it off.
Stop it!	I've got a present for you#
How long has -	All the time.
I already lost everything once.	So did I.
They're going to fly everywhere. Mean things. They should have taken us.	We're too young.
Even if that were true, they're not going to come to your house where you're waiting for them.	He's right.  They'll do it when you're walking somewhere, make it look like street crime.
What?  What is it?	It's very hard for me to come and tell you this.
I understand.  You're upset.  You want to know what's going on.  That's good.	Why are you talking like that?
Don't bother.	What?
I think she's lying.	Me, too.
Should we bring the police into this?	No, not yet.
About the other night, I'm sorry.	Me, too.
Did you meet the President?	Honey, your father knows the President.
Did you tell Dad?	Not yet.
Hi.	Hi.
How's David?	How's David? How's David? He's terrific, Carl.
Okay, young lady, that's it.	Like I give a fuck.
What is wrong with you?  What?  You're going away.  You're getting help somewhere.	You can't make me.
Private?	Yeah.
What are you doing?	Just watch.
Are you kidding#  I'm staying with you --	He's gonna fucking die right here on the kitchen floor --
Are you getting this on tape?	I love my job.  I love it.  The next time I'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and I'll get over it.
What do we do?	I don't know.
What do you think she wants?	She's your girlfriend.  Open it, talk about your kids.
What do you think it is?	Depends who it's from.
I'll put this in the back.	No --
David --	We're playing!
You were followed by the police, but they won't hear us over the children. I want to use a bomb.	You're kidding.  Can't you shoot him or something?
My husband had been working on something he called, The Project for the Children.  Are you aware of this?	I don't know.  Perhaps I remember something.
You first.	I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.
Relax.  If they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert.	They wouldn't do it in front of all these people.  They'd send someone later, when we're alone.
A group of us are going out tonight.	Who?
Somewhere safe.	Where?
That's your past.  I want to talk about your future.  Would you be willing to do something for me?	If I can.
Can you tell me anything?  Do you have any ideas?	I don't know what to say.
Hey man, I'm sorry.  I'm just trying to help.	You want to help?  Stay the fuck away from her.
I don't know, maybe we missed her.	I can't believe you used to bring my daughter here, to this place.
Hello.	I'm sorry# Did I wake you?
Did you tell him?	No. On you go.
What?	The cards. The last thing I said to you was mind the cards.
I want the money, Mark, that's all.	If everyone keeps their mouth shut, there'll be no one going to jail.
Twenty thousand.	But it's not worth more than fifteen.
What?	I've no fucking cigarettes.
Calm down. You're not going to jail.	Easy for you to say.
What do you want?	Are you clean?
Tommy, let's put the tape on.	Now?
Are you getting out much?	No.
You take the test?	Aye.
What was your price?	Four Grand.
There.	Are you serious?
We go for a walk.	What?
Well, what are you waiting for?	I don't know, Tommy. I don't know if it's# normal.
No, no, it's not possible.	Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!
I couldn't help but notice you pain.	My pain?
Don't tell them you're lost. You'll never live it down.	Is there a problem, gentlemen?
Admit it. We're lost.	All right, we're lost.  But we're making good time.
Your pain runs deep.	What do you know of my pain?
Where did you get this power?	The power was within you.
Oh, no. It isn't that. I knew I wouldn't die because the two of you were with me.	I don't understand.
Captain?	Spock, we're on leave. You can call me Jim.
Goodnight, Spock.	Goodnight, Doctor.
I could use a shower.	Yes.
Spock.	Yes, Captain?
You must allow us to act.	Let me do something.
You mean he's your brother brother?  You made that up!	I did not.
Is it possible?	Is what possible?
Spock?	Welcome aboard, Captain.
Spock, I thought I was going to die.	Not possible. You were never alone.
We must change our course at once.	I'll take you to the bridge.
Spock#  What have you done to my friends?	I've done nothing. This is who they are. Didn't you know that?
No# I didn't.	Now learn something about yourself.
About the ship#	The ship needs its Captain.
I am a Starfleet Officer.	Of course. Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help.
Spock?	I cannot go with you.
Beautiful!	Hello, Alan.
I'm your program?	Right on the money!
This town's full o' live ones.	Not a chance.
You said it.	So# Nice ship you got here. What's our next move?
Yes!	Let's get outta here.
Alan!	Where did you hear that name?
Did we make it?	Yes.
Hey# you guys OK?	How about you?
You'll be having plenty of chances to get hurt, don't worry about that.	Look#just so I can tell my friends what this dream was about, okay? Where am I?
Hey, you know anybody who wants to get hold of some video games# cheap?	You're getting out of the business?
What do you think?	Do it!
You think we can make it there?	We have to.
Do you know what he's talking about?	I have to find out what Alan wants# that comes first.
Where are you going?	Out.  If Dad doesn't care enough about us to be here on his birthday, then why should I care? I'm going to a movie.
I'm done.	Where are you off to young lady?
How was school today?	Fine.
I seem to remember something about a history project that's due tomorrow.	Dad.  You just think you know everything, don't you?
Harry?  HARRY?!	What?
What a team.  See you at eight.	Yep.  Sleep fast.
Thanks dear.	Here, check these out.
Son of a bitch!	What?
Twenty here, fifty there# I figured my wife's boyfriend was taking it.	I thought you moved out.
What?  It's on the way.  She says she's got something for me.	Yeah, right.
There's another guy, still in the car.	Stay on him.
Copy that.	And make it fast.  My horse is getting tired.
Give me the page.	What are you talking about?
I'd like to remind you that it has been ten years since you were actually in one of these.	If I break it they can take it out of my pay.
He's got it.	Sorry.
I should have gone to the police, I suppose.	But you didn't.  Why not?
Look, if you ask me everything twice, this is going to take a really long time.  And I have to get home to my family.	You're not going anywhere.
Call me, if you'd like to see some of my other pieces.	I'd like that.
Well, what's the point of waiting?	I agree.
Yes.	Yes what?
Hi, honey.  How was the flight?	Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.
I'm late.	Me too.
I'm sorry.  Thank you for the party.	Yeah.  It was great.
I was in the area, and I thought you might like to have lunch.	They must've just missed me.
Why did you continue to see him?	He needed my help.
I don't know.  I guess I needed something#	What did you need?
Let me out of her!  Right now!	Answer the question--
What?	Do you still love your husband?
What were you doing there?	You wouldn't believe me.
Harry, what's the matter with you?  Tell them the truth.  We're married, we have a daughter--	I don't know what this crazy bitch is on.  You should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
I'm sorry, honey.	Don't call me honey!  You don't ever get to call me honey again. You understand?!  You pig!
What is it?	God, you have great legs.
What are you going to do?	Go down there and kill everybody, I guess.
Not yet.  But we'll find him.	Dance?
What does she do?	Some kinda legal secretary of something.  Married to some boring jerk.
Beat it.	No.  Soon as I turn you'll shoot me.
What?	Get going! 
Like one?	Fuck you.
Yes.  I suppose so.  Where?	The same place.  One o'clock.  I have to go now.  See you tomorrow.  Remember, I need you.
Are you sure you weren't followed?	I kept looking back, like you taught me.  I didn't see anyone.
Did you read the papers yesterday?	Yes.
Tell me what happened?	I'm sorry, I can't.
Who is this woman?	His wife.
He said don't go nowhere. We'll be there some time tomorrow.	Wait a minute -
Did you get the letter?	What letter?
Not yet.	Nope.
Let me speak to Clarence.	He wants to speak with you.
That was so good I am gonna have another.	You can't have just one.
The letter I sent.	The letter he sent.
Has he looked through it yet?	Ya looked through it?
Tell him to look through it.	Get it.
Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?	Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.
Where's your car? I'll walk you to it.	I took a cab.
Well, enough about the King. How about you?	How 'bout me what?
Ask me them again. One by one.	What do you do?
Like it?	Very much. Now, where were we?
What's wrong, sweetheart? Did I do something? What did I do?	You didn't do nothing.
Yes.	You will?
I do.	Thank you.
No no no no no no no no no#	Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes#
Where you goin', honey?	I just gotta get somethin'.
Was it him or you?	Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, "If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it." I could. So I did.
I think what you did was#	What?
What?	Can you live with it?
Where the fuck is that bitch?	She's with me.
Clarence?	You got it.
Well, there's a story behind all that. I'll tell you when I see you. By the way, I won't be alone. I'm bringing my wife with me.	Get the fuck outta here!
Money problems?	Now tell him goodbye.
That's a pretty amazing story.	Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?
How much of that letter was on the up and up?	Every word of it.
You're really in love, aren't you?	For the very first time in my life.  Do you know what that's like?
This shit can't be real.	It'll get ya high.
It's fuckin' real!  It's fuckin' real!	I certainly hope so.
Clarence#	Let me handle this.
Clarence.	Yeah?
What the fuck did you bring that for.	In case.
Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here.	Yeah, let's just get outta here.
No. But thanks.	No thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that made me a little sick.
Well, enough about the King, how 'bout you?	How 'bout me what?
Where's everybody else?	They'll be along.
Well, I guess it's about that time.	I guess so. Follow me.
Don't you?	No.
Wanna count your money?	Actually, they can count it. I'd like to use the little boy's room.
What do you want from me?	What?
Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.	I got some money I can give you -
I'm me# I mean, that's me.	Step inside.
That was very good.	Thank you.
He'll wear a wire?	We talked him into it.
You do more than try.	You do.
He knows.	How the fuck could he know?
You gotta hold this for me.	You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
Wake up, Cole.	Uh, I didn't hear the#
Well?	Uh, what?
I understand.  There'd be no point.	We're going to think about it, Cole. Among ourselves.  We'll get back to you.
We're very close!  Because of you!	This is it, James#what you've been working for.
That's him.	What are you going to do with us?
They forced me to take drugs.	Forced you!  Why would someone force you to take drugs?
It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.	Perhaps it was a wrong number#
It's just a shot to calm you.	No more drugs.  Please#
You used to call me "James".	You'd prefer that? # James#you don't really have a gun, do you.
You were in my dream just now.  Your hair was different, but I'm sure it was you.	We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours.  What was the dream about?
They're keeping an eye on me.	Who's keeping an eye on you?
Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him!	I did him a favor.  Now come on.
You didn't have a gun before, did you?	I've got one now.
I told you what I want.  Lock the door!	James, why don't we#?
We need gas.	I thought you didn't know how to drive.
You were going to run out off gas on purpose, weren't you?	No.  I want you to turn yourself in, James -- It'll go much better for you if you do -- but I'm not going to trick you.
You smell so good.	You have to give yourself up, you know.
What does this mean to you?	#I had a dream about#something like that.
You want me to rob him?	I#I#We need cash, James.
You were in my dream just now.  I didn't recognize you.	Well, you look pretty different, too.
They may be looking for us, James.  Use this.  You can fix it in the Men's Room.	I was here#as a kid.  I think you were here, too.  But you#looked just like you look now.
I don't have time to go upstairs.  The police are looking for me.  I need to know where it is and exactly what it is.	I get it!  This is your old plan, right?
This part isn't about the virus, is it?	Hey, man#
But you know what's real now?	Yes, sir.
What#virus?	She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew you were going to try this.
Nine thirty	Might be tight.
Hey!  You there!	You want something, old man?
Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.	Christ!
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.	Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
Can I help you, sir?	I need a ticket.
Accident.	You got to be more careful.  I remember one time--
Hey.	Hey, your . . . what the hell happened to you.
Goddamn you!  You son of a bitch!	There you go, sweet talking me again.
What you want?	Open up!
What the hell . . . oh it's you. Might've figured.  What do you want?	I want my car.
Now that you're so well off, can I get you something, Hon?	You got beer?
Jake.  I thought you would be at work, dear.	Who the hell is this!?
Who was that on the phone?	Wrong number.
What the hell you looking at, girl?	Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
What's the matter?	You didn't hear something?
Jake, what is that?	What does it look like?
Oh my God, Jake, no.  If it is someone they'll go away.  Or call the police.  Don't go out there.	What are you afraid of?  I'm the one's got the gun.  Stay here.
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?	I'm just going to my car.
No, I've got it.	What happened to your hand?
Thank you, John.	You're welcome, Grace.
Nice place you got here.	Thank you.
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.	I guess it must.
My face tell you all that?	It tells me what every face tells me.  Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
There.  All done.  Lift me down.	What?
You can let go of me now.  I'm safe.  How do they look.	Like you.
All right, Grace.  No more games.	Games?
I think I can find my own way back to into town.	Maybe I like to find out about a man first.  Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
You never did answer my question.	Still playing?
Damn it, Grace!  Tell him.	If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true.
How far is it to California?	From here?  I don't know.  Far.  Far enough.
John?  John where are you going?	I think this heat is making me crazy.  I was crazy to come back here, I'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy if I spent another minute in this place.
Shit!	It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.
I thought you would be on your way to Vegas by now.  Is there something you wanted?	I wanted to talk.
Why the hell didn't you do anything?	What was I supposed to do?
Where's the safe?	I don't know.
Nothing.  There's no safe under here.	There has to be!
If you want.	We're going all the way.  Together.
Let's go in the bedroom.	No.
Let's do it here.	What about him?
That's all talk.  He's got nothing on us.  He let you kill Jake.	Not me.  Us.
I shot him.	You killed him!
You're crazy, you know that!? You're fucked up!?	Just drive.
Jesus, Grace.  Did you have to kill him?	He was going to--
Is that the kind of girl you think I am?  What can I do to make you relax?	You could give me the gun.
Well, nothing.	Now what?
John!	Grace!
Are you all right?	I think I busted my leg.
I can't make it.  Grace?  Grace!?	I'm here.
John!  Can you hear me?  Are you still there?	Where the hell am I going to go?
John, throw me the keys.	What for?
Who the hell are you?	I'm her husband.
What happened to your hand?	Accident.
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit. A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh?  Women.	Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
Would you?	Would I what?
Good Lord.  What happened to you?	Just ran into a little trouble.
Now what can I do for you?	I was hoping we could talk.
This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.	And tell her what?
I went to your place.  We talked, just like you told me.  We drove out into the desert . . .	Is the job done?
Maybe not this time, but somebody's going to get dead around you.	No.
Yeah, well, me too.	Trouble with the car again?
I want to stay.	I said come on!
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter?	What?
What happened to your hand?	Accident, and yeah, I got to be more careful.
Hey, Mister.  Mister.  I just. . . I just wanted to thank you.	For what?
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.	Get away from me!
I wasn't doing anything.	That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.	You expect me to believe that?
Mister!	Oh, shit!
Now, what's this?	Give it to me!
Saw you at the truck stop this morning.  You're not from around here.	No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
Why don't you step out of the car, son?	I don't understand what the--
Hey!  You there!	You want something, old man?
Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle.	Christ!
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.	Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
You are crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old man.	You know I won't be seeing you.
I wasn't doing anything.	That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.	You expect me to believe that?
Mister!	Oh, shit!
Now, what's this?	Give it to me!
Who the hell is this!?	Who the hell are you?
What the fuck do you want?	I'll give you a lift, son. Too hot to be walking# People die out here, y'know.
California#	Live there?
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit.  A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh? Women.	Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
Would you?	Would I what?
Next time you'll do just fine.	No!
I came for Grace.	You came to take my wife from me?
Shhh! Liar.	It's the truth, Jake.
How the hell did you know where the bedroom's at?	What are you talking about!
Come on, Jake --	Don't Jake me boy! It's a big house. You probably didn't even make it out to the desert this afternoon#
Hey mister. Mister, I just# I just wanted to thank you.	For what?
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.	Get away from me!
Hey.	Hey, your # what the hell happened to you?
What you want?	Open up!
I call the sheriff.	No! No police.
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?	I'm just going to my car?
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.	You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
No, I've got it.	What happened to your hand?
Thank you, Bobby.	You're welcome, Grace.
Nice place.	Thank you.
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.	I guess it must.
My face tell you all that?	It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
There.  All done.  Lift me down.	What?
You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?	Like you.
I think I can find my own way back to into town.	Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
You never did answer my question.	Still playing?
What's the matter?#Grace?	Nothing.
Oh yeah. It's far, it's another world.	Is it pretty?
I wanted to talk.	I don't think we have anything to talk about.
The money's right here! Get the key!	No! You get it!
I can't see it.	It should be just up ahead.  Hold on # there!  There it is!
Hey!  Take it easy.  Want to get us killed?	You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
You know I thought you'd left me back there.	What are you talking about?
Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you and me.	He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and #
Why?	I don't know why!
Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted to? What can I do to make you relax, baby?	You could give me my gun back.
I think nothing happens. You're dead meat. That's it.	You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
Well, nothing. We dump Jake, we split the money, then you're on your own.	Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.
Thank you. Thank you. I#I knew you wouldn't leave me, Grace.	Bobby? Are you all right?
Why's that?	'Cause I love you.
And I love you too.	And love's a funny thing.  Sometimes I don't know if I want to love you#
Jake#	He can't help you now, honey!
I need a ticket.	Where to?
You got a beer?	What kind?
You fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?	No baby, you got it wrong.
Who was that on the phone?	Wrong number.
What the hell you looking at, girl?	Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
Ya little bitch, you like it don't you! You like it this way -- rough and hard. Gotta go fuck around on me, like your Mama, but you always gotta come home to Daddy, don't you, cause you know Daddy's the best.	Yes, yes, hit me#beat me, please.
What's the matter?	You didn't hear something?
Help me, Grace, help#	Like you helped her, Jake?
I want to stay.	I said come on!
Is that the entire message?	Yes.
No, no, no, no no# You need to go now.	What did I say?
I'm listening.	I'll keep it in my office room.
I don't think I got the job in New York.	What does that mean?
I don't know. It's been a while.	I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
Is that what you wanted to ask me?	Yes.
I've come to a decision.	Oh.
I remember you.	I was hoping you would call me, but# Anyway I decided not to wait.  I was thinking, it might be nice to go to dinner together.
Would you like to try going--	Yes.
I didn't know that. Mine's still brown.	My turn. What's your favorite song?
I'm not sure.	Think carefully?
You've never been sick?	I don't know for sure.  #I don't think so.
What's he talking about?	In college. A car accident.
You forgot the "Now I'm going to tell you what the hell is going on" step. See usually that comes before the, "It's over" Step. And it always, always comes before the "You can go" Step.  What is over?	The life of an idea that has lived too long in my head.
Just give me a minute.	Is there a problem?
I thought he was carrying something.	But not a knife?
I have to go now.	One last question.
Quick.	The car accident you were in# Was there anyone else involved?
Yeah?	There's a message for you at the office. Your kid was hurt.
When?	Just now. They want you to come down to his school.
You put too much. That's two hundred and fifty pounds.	How much can you lift?
How much did you take off?	I lied.
What do you do if something happens?	Get mom.
How many did you put on that time?	All of it.
I'm sleeping in my room.	I see.
I know now.	Know what?
That was me they were talking about. I almost died. That was me.	You're lying.
Not really.	This kid is six foot two, two hundred and forty pounds. He runs the fifty in under six seconds. He's going to be a God.
How are you feeling?	Okay.
Where were you sitting on the train?	Against a window.
Twelve years.	How did you get together?
No more sitting in this room. I've let it go on long enough.	I'm not going out anymore. I'm not getting hurt again. This was the last time. I told you.
#I got a present for you.	Why?
Well, go get it then.	Where is it?
Where'd you get the money, huh?	We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
Rain's coming.	Thank God.
He tell you where them others is?	Nope.
Some big guy beat the shit out of me.  I guess I must look a lot like you, huh?	You don't look nothin' like me, mister.
You're a beautiful woman an'# if I was to want a free one, I guess I'd want you more than them others. It ain't# See# I can't have no free one on account of my wife#	Your wife?
I don't# deserve this# to die this way. I was# building a house.	"Deserve" don't mean shit, Little Bill.
The questions Little Bill asked him# what sort of questions was they?	About where you an' him  was# an' where you was from# an' what your names was# an'#
Well, we was. Like you said, I changed my mind an'#	Wasn't nothin' said about no partner.
Three ways, I figured.	No.
You're goin' back with him?	He's my partner. He don't go, I don't.
Shit!	What happened, did you hit him?
When we gonna double back?	After a ways.
You're gonna lose your share. If you don't#	Shut up, Kid.
Did# you# get# him?	Yeah.
Yeah, I guess so.	Shit# I thought they was gonna get us. I was even# scared a little# just for a minute.  Was you ever scared in them days?
Say, Bill#	Yeah.
That was# the first one.	First one what?
You# gonna take# the money?	You better get on back, Miss.
I# I# think I'm# shot.	You ain't shot.
How long you gonna be, Bill?	Two weeks, I guess.
Got used to my bed. Ain't gonna feel to home out here.	Well, it ain't just the bed I'm gonna miss. I'm#  Hell, Billy, I'm sorry. I didn't mean#
Who's he?	Best we move that pig.
That fella come by# Tom.	Tom?
Did you# did you# ?	Did I what?
You was right to change your mind, Kid.	Yeah?
Jesus.  You done this before?	Plenty of times.
We're gonna need more food# at least three days worth#	Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.
He's gonna die, ain't he?	Maybe.
Everybody I ever worked with, did time with.	They fucking know everything.
Why don't you just calm down'	What do you care what he says?
Roger really. People say I talk too much.	Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.
What are we gonna do?	I can run. I got no problem with that.
Me too.	Did you hear what he just said?
What the hell do you want?	I wanted to talk to you. The other guys -
Get out.	If you'll just let me -
You have to come.	What's with you? What do you care whether I come or not?
They - They don't know me. You do. They won't take me unless you go. Look at me. I need this.	Tough break.
You watch your mouth.	Okay, okay. You say it's the real thing? That's cool.
I was out of line.	You okay?
We'll make it.	Don't do this. Send her a card - something.
Ready?	What time is it?
Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later.	Business or personal?
A little of both.	Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested.
I wanted to. I thought we could make it.	Why didn't you say anything?
I didn't know. I saw him die. I believe he's dead. Christ	Why lie about everything else, then?
If we were to go to trial, would we win the case?	Well, of course, it's always dangerous #
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.	And no one will know the truth.
What are you doing here?	Mickey told me to come back to work.
That's the call that I'm waiting for.	What does it mean?
Anything special about the case?	When she#
I did.	Objection.
No further questions.	You may step down.
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up.  Who do you think you are?    Who do you think you are#?	Hold on a second.
She getting good care over there?	Actually, yes.  It's by no means bad, I#
I didn't do too well for you.	No, you did fine.
You sure you don't want me to stay on.	No.  No.  Thank you. You go home.
They called, they're going to settle, what I want to do is build up as much #	Right.  Who called?
Yes.	Why?
Thank you #	# that's perfectly all right.
What is it?	Thank you for seeing me.
D'you find an apartment?	Still looking.
The weak, the weak have got to have somebody to fight for them. Isn't that the truth?  You want another drink?	I think I will.
Would you like me to leave#?   Is this a bad time --?	What#?
I've got to work#	Do you want me to go#?
Why don't you get some rest?	I've got to work.
Do you think it's my fault?	Isn't there something you#
And it's over#?	Yes.
Is it over?	No.
Thank you.	I have to talk to you.
Hi, Mickey #	What the hell do you think you're doing #?  What's going on here #?
I have to talk to you.	What do you want?
Are you out of your mind#?	#I'm going to need your help#
What happened, Joey#?	I can't talk now.
Okay.  What do you do when you don't have a witness?	You use their witness.
Are you with me#are you awake#?	Yeah.  I'm awake.
What the hell are you doing here?	We got to talk.
What are you doing in New York#?	Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee#
We just can't do it anymore.   This is our chance to get away.	I'm going to see you get that chance.
I spoke to her, and everything is all right.	I, what are you talking about?  I talked to her this morning, and she said#
Hi.	Hi.  How are you doing?
I've been meaning to come in a long time.	You live in the neighborhood?
Thank you.	You're really#  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?	Yes.
Well, well, well.  Huh?	Yeah.
Shouldn't you be sitting down?	No, I'm all right.
Hello?	Did she hurt herself?
Could I ask you a couple of questions?	What for? Who are you?
Just let me talk to you.	What about?
What do you want to know?	Your name. And --
Listen, what is this? What do you want?	I want to know who you are.
Will you have dinner with me?	Why?
I like that one.	No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
Okay. Now we're going to buy you some clothes.	Honest?
I don't like it!	We'll take it! Will it fit?
I wish you'd leave me alone. I want to go away.	You can.
You don't even want to touch me.	Yes. Yes, I do.
The color of your hair#	Ah, no!
The trouble is, I'm gone now. For you. And I can't do anything about it. I want you to love me. If I let you change me, will that do it? If I do what you tell me, will you love me?	Yes.
No, I don't want to go. I want to stay here.	I need you.
I made it.	What are you going to do?
Love me# keep me safe#	Too late# too late# there's no bringing her back.
Why am I here? What happened?	You#  #fell into the Bay.
You don't remember.	No#
You shouldn't have brought me here, you know.	I# didn't know where you lived.
One shouldn't live alone.	Some people prefer it.
Will you tell me something? Has this ever happened to you before?	What?
Oh! Yes. Hello.	Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
Would you like some coffee?	No! No, thank you!
I hope we will, too.	What?
How old?	Oh# some, two thousand years, or more.
Would you like a drink of water?	No, thank you.
Where are you now?	Here with you.
Where were you born?	Long ago#
No!# No!	Tell me what it is. Where do you go? What takes you away?
No, I can't tell you!	What?!
Take me away from here?	Home?
If I could find the key# find the beginning put it together#	And so explain it away?  But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?
Don't leave me# stay with me#	All the time.
No, don't go away!	Only this far.
Where's your husband?	I didn't wake him. I don't want him to know#
You've been there before. You've seen it.	No, never!
Here with you.	And it's a all real.
My love# because I love you.	I love you too# too late# too late#
There are things I have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. But they can wait. The only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe.	You can't.
You believe that I love you?	Yes.
Let me go into the church alone.	Why?
Is there something I can do for you?	Yes# you run this hotel.
Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong?	Please answer my question.
Her car is gone.	What car?
From that music.	Oh!
Here, I'll show you what I mean. We'll start with this.	That!?!
Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it.	Stop kidding. Wait a minute.
Step number two.	Okay.
Johnny!	Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it --
Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?	Do you know him well?
The poor thing#.	And she died#
Here you are.	You haven't told me everything.
As a matter of fact, I thought I might give it to you.	Oh?
She died.	How?
Yes! That's it!	I thought so!
She's fucking hot!	I need a drink.
How ya doing?	What?
We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.	First of all#
You're an asshole Adam.	You're an asshole.
I was just playing#we were playing just playing around.	She's dead.
Don't even start.	You want to hear me out?
Wait!	What?
Everybody shut up. LISTEN TO ME!	Listen to me. Please. Everybody just calm down a bit here. Okay# First#are we sure she's dead?
Stop it!	There's more.
Bury her out in the desert.	Sure, why not.
Wait. Wait a minute.	What?
What is your problem?	I can't do this.
We'll be ready Adam.	I know you'll be.  Three hours.
No way.	It has to be done.
I want you to hear me out.	What.
Have you thought about what I said?	Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
My god.	There's more.
So. When is the wedding.	Tomorrow.  We are getting married tomorrow.
He's upset about Adam. We're all upset.	I will call the police right now if I don't start getting some answers.
She's not here.	Where is she?
Okay. Hi.	So who's the lucky guy?
Is everything okay?	Great. Fine. Perfect.
She's in there!	I'm just gonna let her know I'm here.
No I don't.	Fish?
But not tonight.	Not tonight.
Where do you look? What side of the neck?	Left side.
He's right.	We can take her out to Red Rock. Find some quiet place#and put her in the ground.
I got her arm.	Here's his head.
The past is the past. Today is the beginning of the rest of our lives.	Today is the best day of the rest of our lives.
What's your fucking point?	I'm not talking to you?
He just had two.	Give me two more.
Oh, Jesus#call the police.	No.
Nobody knows she's here.	Good God#Good God#
It goes; "Today is the first day of the rest of our lives."	However it goes, the point is, nobody says anything to anyone ever. Right? #Right?
That's right.	Isn't it a little late?
The hell I did!	The hell you didn't!
I don't hate women.	You hate women.
This is going to stop right now. Right now!	You will not screw this up.
Stop it. I'm sorry.	You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
He just doesn't talk a lot.	Why? What's his problem?
Do you love me?	Of course.
We've got problems here.	Problems?
Will you please call the chair people?	I will.
Hello.	Hi.
Hi.  Are you calling from jail?	Not yet.
Hello.	Hey. It's me.
Yeah baby. Everything's great.	Well, can you come back inside?
That means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids.	No.
It's okay#It's okay baby. Cry for Mama. Cry for Mama.	No it's not okay. It's not.
I wanted to just take this final opportunity to visit with you. You know, just to be with you, father and son, before you run off and do your own husband, daddy thing.  I'm just so Goddamn proud of you#God knows I didn't always play it right with you#	You did all right dad.
Everything okay?	Yeah, Dad. It's great.
I'm not breathing right.	You're not breathing right?
I don't care for him.	He's your brother.
I'll take a ride.	Go for it.
I'm getting married#	I'm sorry#I'm sorry#I'm sorry#
No#No.	How do you know she's dead.
The first day.	What?
I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter.	Did she believe you?
I'm thinking about maybe making a move.	A move?
He came to me early today, was talking about money, insurance money. Said he was gonna get what was his.	My God#
There.	Where?
I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.	That's what I'm thinking.
I love it. I just love, love, love, love it.	Are you guys gonna fill this place with kids? You sure got room for them.
Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big picture, take your time. I wish I had.	That's our plan.
She's dead.	It was an accident!
Fucking desert.	Fish, I'm really sorry. I just#I owe you man.  Desert.
Right.	That's right.
You see for me it's over. Over baby. I'm gonna turn myself in. After the wedding of course. After the wedding. Out of respect.	I don't think that's a good idea.
I'll come to you tonight.	No, the children sleep with me.
Where's the camera?	It's a present from my parents.
How long are you staying?	A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
How like your aunt you are, even in your walk.	I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
What do you mean?	Nothing. I didn't say anything.
How did you know about that?	Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?
You're lying.	No, it's true.  Last night when you were sleeping, I had you all to myself.
Think about it. Don't hurry. Think it over.	Go away! Leave me alone.
Let me pass!	You must listen to me before you go.
Leave me now. You can go to bed.	Yes, sir. Good night.
Sit down, I'm going to need your help.	What's the matter?
You believe me, don't you?	Yes, sir.
What will the lady say?	She won't even know.
Is it all right?	Yes.
It's very good.	Thank you; but it's missing something.
My God, what have you done to him!	He was asking for it.
Not in that way; you're always looking for company.	Why do you say that? Perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous.
What's the matter with you?	Nothing.
If you wake first, wake me up.	What are you going to do?
What I do every day, but I want to do it earlier.	You're happy, aren't you!
What are you thinking about?	That your cousin is more to your taste.
She isn't my cousin.	It doesn't make any difference what she is: you like her.
How in hell does it wind up?	I think I'd better go tomorrow.
Kill him.	That will teach you not to bother me any more, you son of a bitch.
He was very good. Better than some people would think.	Why did he kill himself?
I don't know, sir.	One shouldn't be alone the whole time.  I'm not like him, am I?
I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you.	Why?
I don't understand how you can like being alone so much.	I'm not like you, you have your wife.
What are you doing here? Get out.	Leave him alone.
Don't forget the meeting with the lawyer. The car will pick you up tomorrow morning.	I'll be ready.
Yes. Why?	You can come and live again in the big house if you want. Now that I'm alone, I can settle down anywhere.
And #your friend?	She's left.
It's for people!	Then let him go and he'll follow you.
How are you today?	Things seem to be getting better.
Are your parents alive?	Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
You'll soon find out, you liar!	Stop this!
Why are you crying?	I'm afraid.
It's a very big one.	Very, very?
I hardly know him. I saw him only once, some years ago. I can't even remember him.	In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
Good morning. You weren't expecting me, were you?	Mother.
Give the little girl to me. Come here, sweetheart. Are you ready?	When you are, miss.
Don't talk like that!	I'll talk the way I want to. I've had enough of this.
Hello.	Hello.
What?	Yes, yes, I saw you!
Recognize this? How would you like your old job back?	Catch him and your record's clean.
Jesus Christ.  Can you kill it?	If you can catch him.
Think you can do it?	Not from in here.
HEY!!!	Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours.
I wonder how that#	Turn it down!
SID  NO!!!	What do you expect me to do, thank him?
I am beautiful, aren't I?	Of course you are.
You all right?	Fine. Never felt better in my life.  See, I'm a good liar.
You ready for this?	Don't worry. If I can't handle it, I'll just kill everybody.
You've got a problem with me carrying a gun?	Do me one favor  if you shoot at anything, make sure I'm nowhere near it.
I'm surprised you didn't write one about me.	I'm still working on it.
Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.	How did you get your hand out?
Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?	I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
Don't get out of the car.	Stop me.
What did you do to those people?	Nothing.
What's the problem?	I'm doing the best I can!
Whatever he was doing here was only the start.	Start of what?
Which way?	Both.
Nice work.	Thanks.
Find out anything?	A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.
Can I ask you something?	You mean there's something you haven't asked me?
You okay?	#I think so#You?
What do we do now?	You won't want to watch. Turn around.
#tonight#	You're with him tonight, watching the President's Speech, when the President#
Okay.  Here's what we're gonna do.	I need a little bit of help#?
He, uh, has he been in the "jail" long?	#twelve years.

Then why do you still like her?	Like her?  I don't know if I ever liked her.  It's just you want what you can't get.
No, no James, it's not like that.  Tony and China, they're just friends.	That's not what you said last night.
If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.	Who's is all this?
Well, it all started when a friend and I	China

You should have heard her play.	Stop.
How you holding up?	Good.  I'm good.
Oh my god.  You bought it.	Yep.
You think he killed her?	I don't know.  When you say it, it sounds crazy.  But what else could it all be?
Know what I think?	What?
Someone's there.	What?
Nothing's happening.	Shhh.
Are you okay?	I think so
Okay.  Okay.	I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you.
I'm a terrible friend.	No.
How could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself?	What are you going to do?
You've got a beautiful life.  And even with this, it's always been clear that he loves you.  I've come to think that's all that really matters.	I don't know#
Christ, that's twice in#When did they move in?	I think three#
She's awake.	We'll be quiet.  Quick and quiet.
It's today?	Yep.
If you have to work#	No, no.  I'm just about#  There.

Nothing.  There was#I thought I saw something.	Is it gone?
Hi.	I'm stuck here for another couple of hours.
Oh.	Unless you need me to come home#
I think so.  Maybe.	You are so brilliant.
He killed her.	What?
Our house.	No.  Look!  In the window.
Where is she then?	She could be out.  She could be sick in bed for all we know.
See?	What am I looking at?
When you do this, I swear#	#Don't get all#
What are you doing?	Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.
You're not at the center.	I know I'm not at the center of the bridge.
What are you doing out here?	He killed her.  I'm not crazy.  He killed her and--
Keep your voice down.	I will NOT.
I'm sorry#	Then where is she?
Do I have everything?	Yep.
What?	Are you glad?  I'm glad.
You don't remember?	When she said it, there was something familiar#but no.
You dropped a glass.	I#
I take it your not mad at me.	Wouldn't go that far.
I don't like this, this#	Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor.
I think she's starting to suspect something.	Who?
"You know#"	What?
She did it.	We don't know that for sure.
We have to get out of here.	It's alright.
What's that for?	Nothing.
She's out there isn't she?  She's in the lake.	Okay.  Don't#you don't understand what this is.
I have seen him again.  Last night.	But you've not told Michael.
There are two.	Two what#?
With his hands!	But why would they do that#?
I'll probably be back in a week#but I can't spend Christmas in that house.   you'll check on her - every day#?	Every day  twice.
Go back, MICHAEL# Go Back	The door, Michael.  find the key#
Michael#  Do what you can.	Michael#  Help us#  The door!
You do not love Michael   How can you love - if you lie#?	Lie#?
Made it#?	It is from love.
You're very clever, aren't you#?	I am only what you are --- what all of you have been.   what do you think of yourself now, my love#?
There is no one here but the dead.	Go away!  I don't want you here.
A girl#?	It's too soon to know.
--- and I have heard you from the beginning# from it's very first beat.	I love Michael#
What is wrong#?	Wrong#?  Science is not magic.
Just one.  The bar's closed.	The one time I want it to work#
Far from it, Michael# Don't put me up there.	All I meant was -
Christ, Michael - what the hell are we doing#?  We don't even know -	Is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is#?
We're quite a pair, you and I.	Mad. for each other.
Hello#?	Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -
You know#?	I know.  It's not possible --- but I know.
She - she said I - I was a ---	- a witch.
Do you love me, Michael#?	Yes.  I love you.  Very much.
You sure#?	It's the next best thing to being there' - right#?
You did that, didn't you#?	Talking to me dear#?
Remember the first time we made love - and then ---	- we made a fire.
Is he - is he gonna die#?	Lock the door.  Lock it
Something's wrong with you.	Nothing is wrong with me.  I know something's in there - and so do you.
Hi.	Hi.    You - you wanna get some breakfast#?  Maybe see a movie#?
I can't.	That's not good enough.  Why not#?!
I've never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me inside!  But I'm on the outside now#  you put me there!	Michael - please -  just. a little longer.  Don't leave.
sooner Or later you're gonna run out of things to change.  You always do.	I just - hate it when they're - finished.
Wow#	If you like that type.
We'd better get to work on the papers.	Papers#?
Which do you think is her best shot#	The one on the left - definitely#
I thought you were someone else	Well I'm glad I'm not them - what are you doing here so late? Come to that, what the hell have you got that for?
This must be one of the old keys -	Yes - I have had it for years.
Oh - Tell me ELLEN, I can call you ELLEN?	Sure#
I lost the touch	The touch?
What are you doing?	I'm sorry?
If you want any - there's some left in the kitchen	I think I will pass#
Sugar?	Yes, one and a half please.
Do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed	Why should I feel sorry - they're dead.
How long have you been watching me?	I have something I have to show you#
Tell me how it happened#	Why should I?
You think I killed my MOTHER don't you?	Did you?
I want it to stop - it all to stop#	Then make it stop#
What's wrong?	Nothing could be better#
What is it?	Open it#
Where are you going?	Out - I may be some time
First finish your tea#	He doesn't need to#
Why did you let him in?	What was I supposed to do?
I don't like sugar	There isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea?
I don't want either of us to come to any harm - please#	You killed my friend!
I loved you ELLEN - why did you do this?	It's what you would do to me
Well, what do you think?	I don't know - it's your house ELLEN
You don't own him you know - you can't tell me not to see him!	Yes I can#
I want you out now	Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?
It's been what, three years?	What's this all about?
Her husband left her	Oh#
Sugar?	Yes - one please.
Who the hell was your father?	Well, Dad said#
You kiss your mother with that mouth?	I'd kiss your mother with this mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you know#
Check this out.  Hurry!	I better go, Dad.
Hurry.	What is it now?
I get it now. You and me. We're dead.	Dead?
Never say never.	Oh, god.  Look. Look.
Ted, have you lost your mind?	You like me. I like you. I guess it's pretty obvious to everyone.
God, you are so hot.	Then you better get in the water, before you get burned.
You guys are my parents.	Of course we are.
Son.	Well, why should I?
Sorry I--	It's okay. You need me?
You do know how to drive?	I don't have much experience with a#uh#stick.
Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted? It's in your blood.	I always knew there was more. I felt it.
Ted! Do something!	What do you want me to do?
Well?	I guess#I don't know#I guess we should leave if we're not wanted.
If you could just sign right there.	You want it in writing?
Where are we going?	To the best hiding place in the world.
I can't believe your dad built this for you.	He didn't. He had it built.
That's probably my office.	Well? Where the hell are you?
They're playing our song.  Dare I ask for this dance?	You better.
Well? Surprised?	What is all this? When are you coming home?
But who would run the store?	Forget the store. Think big.
You do like girls, don't you?	Of course I like girls.
Maybe she needs help, Ted. You should be a gentleman.	I#uh#I think she's doing fine on her own.
Truth is, I'm a little nervous.	YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
I told you you could do it.	I was like a different person tonight.
I owe it all to you. Without your help I'd be lost.	I wish I knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up.
Oh no. No way. I've had all the bad news I can take for one day.	It's about your parents.
Not that I'm going to be much good after last night#	Eat a power bar.
You look pretty.	Thanks.
You come all the way out here to watch Walter?	I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
You okay?	I'm fine.  Nice TV.
How are you, Kelly? Would you like to take a break for a minute?	I just want to get it over with.  My mom's making me do this. I just want to forget it.
And when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car?	Again.  I think we covered this.  I told her I was going to call a cab.
I don't know what to say#	You could tell me where you were last night.
Same as him.  They saw her come.  They saw her go.  They saw him follow.	Still doesn't explain why he couldn't catch up with her.  I mean how long does it take to put on a shirt?
Guess I kind of lost it there.	You could say that.
If you want company#	Just check out the car.
Will you do me one favor?	Ray, you heard him#
About a year ago.	He dropped Jimmy off first?
At that point were you able to fight him off?	No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go.
He did say something.	What was that?
Why?	I think she's acting.  I think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her.  I think maybe she's upset that he didn't#
I fucked up.  I lost control of the situation, the one thing they train you for# God, what did I do?	Just tell us what happened.
You guess?  Did he or didn't he?	Yeah# okay# he did
What did you do then?	Shit, what difference does it make# Nobody's gonna believe me anyway#
This wasn't my idea.	I'm sorry?
I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you?	I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?	Oh, for Christ's sake.
What are you looking at?	Nothing.
Get off my property.	I'm not on your property!
Kelly.  What is it?	I miss Dad.
Don't forget the car wash.	I won't.
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?	So you got my mom's money.
How much?	About six and a half million dollars.
God, you scared the shit out of me.  You must be crazy coming here.	Of course I'm crazy.  Ask my mom.
The only way we're gonna blow this now, is if we do it ourselves#	Do it to ourselves?
I'm sorry, Kelly.  I'm sorry it had to happen like this.  She was losing it#	There was no way.  That cop would've gotten her to tell him# everything. She was weak and dumb#
Hello?	Hello.
I'm running away.	You think that's wise?
Where is she?	Where she lives.  In the guest house. Now will you tell me what this is about?
No.	Will they?
Is that what you think?  You have friends?  Is that what they told you?	I don't mean who you're thinking.  I have other friends#
Why don't you tell us one more time, how Kelly came to be with you, alone in your house.	Story's the same, Detective#
But she ran away.	That's right.
Yeah, well, you fixed that.  What the hell happened, anyway?	The bitch shot me, is what happened.
Sam#	Put Kelly on too.
What?	That was the same thing Ray said.
Seems to like some of the same places you do.  Funny you never met.	Yeah, real funny.  You're wrong about this, I could get busted on the spot.
I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?	We?
But don't pull that again.	Wouldn't dream of it.
What was all that back there?	All what?
At least I tried something.	Hey, I tried the board.
If you don't mind my asking, were you always the way you are?	What way is that?
Can you fill me in here?	Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
This is good.	Shhh!  Come on.  Tell us something!
Oh, damn!  That's it.	It's better than nothing.
What's this?	Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
Damn, I wish this thing would go faster.	Relax.  We're almost there.
Excellent detective work, sir.  You should have the honor of going first.	Oh, thank you.
It was in your book.	Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.
My hat is off to you, sir.	Thank you.
Well, we'll stay in touch# you know.	I'm sure we will.
You didn't tell us you had this on!	My Lord, he was telling the truth!
A new friend?	We'll see.
I could get used to this, looking down on people.	They don't even realize they should be frightened.
You've# done# this# before.	I've had some practice.
My.  It's gotten longer.	You bring the best out in a man.
Look, I'm Captain James West#	Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.
Your private train, sir.	Private train?
Mr. President, good to see you again, sir.  Sorry about all that.	That'll be all, boys.
Gotta get the Doctor someplace safe.	Who were they?  What do they want with me?
Are you all right?	For the moment.  But I fear not for long.  I'm of no use to him now.
He# he's planning to kill us, isn't he?	He's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.
Now it's a bomb.	It is?
Well?	They're coming.
Hey#!	You're not going to use it, are you?
Thank you, friend.	Let's go.
You!  Are you the mother of that child?	No.  I mean yes.
I can't.	Let me see it.
I can't.	Why not?
I do what I'm told.	Too bad you're not more like your father.
You're a fool.  Now put her back.	I'm not going to let this baby die.
Why did you say that?	Say what?
Because it's true.	I don't believe you.
Then you get us out of here.	I will!  But I need help!
What's that?  I hear something!	You hear trouble.
You gotta promise to feed her.	I will.
You!!	Where the hell did you come from?
Because she's sick.	Because she's sick.
Where's the baby??	I thought you had her!
I'll help you#!	I won't.
Did she ask about me?	Who?
She's in love.	You're crazy.  I think you're in love.
Kill him!	No!
You must learn magic.	That's all I ever wanted!
I'm not going in there.	Me neither!
She needs to be changed.	I changed her already!
She's hungry.	I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
Talk!  Say something!	I can't see anything--she's too bright!
How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company	Sorry. It's important.
Put my car in the garage and close the door.	John, I don't understand any of this.
Everything is all right, John.	Pick up the hat.
I saw him.	Who'd you see?
Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the floor?	No# I saw the man who killed him.
He was# like him.	Black# I understand. What else,Sam?
Hey, Sam#	#I want to say a thing.
Don't let them hurt you.	I won't. Now run.  Fast as you can!
What's your first move?	A hot shower# I haven't changed clothes in two days.
Who else knows?	Just us.
It's all over, Paul.	Move! Or you die right here!
Where are you taking us?	We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.
What was that?	He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you.
Your sister said you don't have a family?	No.
Where are you taking us now?	Home.
Stay for awhile. Rest. I'll make coffee and breakfast.	I can't.
But John# why didn't you go to a hospital?	No, no doctor#
Sure.	But# You may not be well enough.
When will you be going?	Not long# A few days.
There was a time when I thought you might have stayed.	There was.
Anybody know about this?	I didn't even know about it.
It's me.	Johnny! Where the hell have you been?
You hear me?	I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
You know where he is.	Wrong.
You admit you're lying?	I admit I don't know where he is.
Did you find him?	Not yet.
Everything okay?	Yes, thank you very much.
Good morning.	You didn't have to#
Who was that man?	His name is John Book.
Is the English dead?	No#
I am not a child.	You are acting like one!
She say where he is?	I don't think she knows.
What about Carter?	Tight. But I'm working on him.
He's not in this building.	All right, where is he?
No, you listen. Get out!	Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal.  He's got a gun, hasn't he?
He'll live.	You might have killed him!
Get back in there.	My son is out there!
I don't want to stay here.	They are English. They don't understand.
But I did leave you, Uncle Henry -- that's just the trouble.  And I tried to get back for days and days.	There, there, lie quiet now.  You just had a bad dream.
Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back!	I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
#didn't you?	No -- No!  It was an accident! I didn't mean to kill anybody!#.
What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me!	All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
And think to yourself -- "There's no place like home; there's no place like home; there's no place like home."	There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.
Yes --	Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you?
Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?	Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
That's our farm!	Oh -- yes.
That's right.  What's she doing?	Well, I -- I can't quite see.  Why, she's crying.
#bed.	Oh, no -- no!
#you don't suppose she could really be sick, do you? Oh -- Oh, I've got to go home right away!	But -- what's this?  I thought you were going along with me.
Oh -- 	But you couldn't have been, could you?
Now you're seeing reason.	No --
Here!  I've got an order!  Let me have#	Stop her!
Oh --	#Oh, did that hurt?
We might.	Oh --
Can't that female take no for an answer?	Oh --
Oh! Something bit me, too!	Now come on - you're acting silly -- 
Dorothy!	I knew you would!
Tomorrow?  Oh, but I want to go home now.	You've had plenty of time already!
What -- what did you do that for?  I didn't bite him.	No, but you tried to.
A home --	The nerve.
Yes -- let's run!	Yes.
Who's her?  Who's her?	It's the Witch!  She's followed us here!
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.	Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
Oh -- Oh, come on.	Huh?  What'd he say?
#Ain't it the truth!  Ain't it the truth!	Oh -- oh -- they're all wonderful.
Oh, now I'll never get home!	Stay with us, then, Dorothy.  We all love you.  We don't want you to go.
Well -- I would never've found it if it hadn't been for you.	I think I'll miss you most of all.
Down?  No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --	Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
Oil can what?	Oil can?  Oh -- oh, here it is!
He said his mouth.	Here -- here --
Yes -- there --	Oh -- here quick -- oh! - we'll oil him up.
-- A hot water bottle would be good if we had one.	Oh, he's been crying! Why have you been --
Oh --	Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
Oh -- Oh --	Oh -- are you -- are you all right?
Oh, come on now - everybody -- 	Did you just hear what I just heard?
Who killed my sister?  Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!	Leave her alone!
Yeah.	Ah --
I've got a plan how to get in there.	Fine.  He's got a plan
Up!	Now#
Where -- where do we go now?	This way!  Come on!
Dorothy!	Dorothy! You can't sleep here! You can't sleep in the middle of a field!
What's that? What's that? Take it away - take it away - Take it away! 	Hold still - hold still --
No?  Now, wait a minute.	You don't neither --
Where do we go now?	Yeah.
#the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door! Open the door!	Don't push!
# about Dorothy.	Dorothy?  Well, what has Dorothy done?
No, sir!	No, sir!
That's right.	We do.
Then I'm sure to get a brain --	A heart --
Come on -- come on --	Hurry -- hurry --
Oh!  Oh, come on, come on!	Look -- you can see it here.  It's wonderful!
Hey, Dorothy!	Dorothy!
Oh!  We ought to try and carry Dorothy.	I don't think I could, but we could try.
Oh, did - did you see that?	Oh - look out.
Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!	Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
Oh, don't worry about me. I'm all right. We must worry about Dorothy.	But how can we find her? We don't even know where she is. Look! There's#.
#to Dorothy!	Oh --
No, you don't.	Oh, no!
Oh - upstairs, quickly!	Go on!
Hey -- what about Dorothy?	Yes -- how about Dorothy?
What about us?	Well, I --
Well --	You promised us real things -- a real#
Then maybe I be# open to that.	Perhaps after this # test?
It a message.  He wants us to know he back.	Who?
The name?	I can tell you#  Alright, alright! But you must protect me!
He was my father.	I sorry.
I met you at my father funeral.	Yes.
I can stay here.	Youe not going to.
I can stay.	I know.
What is it?	#you should rest.
James#	I have to go.
What the hell are you doing here?	Someone wants to kill me, I rather die looking him straight in the eye.  What are you doing here?  Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?
I could have given you the world.	Not interested.
Was this all about the oil?	It is my oil!  Mine and my family!
One# last# screw?	Oh James.
Warm.	Is it?
This is the end.	No.  It is the beginning. The world will never be the same.
Any word from him?	Still no contact yet.
The access code's been changed.  Your card won't work anymore.	What?!
Walter --	Don't call me that.
Then it's going to happen.  The world's going to end.  -- And you've always known.	Always.  Ever since the day I died.
Then why don't you . . . do something about it!	Because --
His what?	His . . . whatever.
This'd better not be what I think it is.	Okay!
What's he doing?	I think he's going to the john.
What was he doing?	Trying to change the past.  He said it was the only way to save the world --
He saved himself.  He changed the past.	Where did he go?
I can fix it.	-- What?
Their real names, please.	I don't know their real names.
New information.	Ever see one of these before?
Is that all?	Just remember, I'll be watching.
Just about anything I want, it looks like. This is gonna be tough, though. There's no way to save this game. I gotta get it right the first time through.	What do you get if you finish?
Where are you going?	Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
Hey, you're good.	Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are.
They tell me you're an American agent.	What are you talking about?
Are you alright?	What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
Where are we going?	We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.
Where'd the damn truck go?!	Go to the water, it's that way!
Nothing. He had two days.	Perhaps he is not all he says he is.
What was that for?	I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together.
I think I'll hang on to these.	Think again, that's government property. You have to sign for everything. I've got one more that wasn't on your list.
Sit down.	I've been on a plane for twelve hours, I think I'll stand.
I'll leave you two alone to talk.	Yeah, thanks a lot.
Dude, what are you doing here?	You killed me, remember? Now I have to hide out here with you. Where have you been?
Sorry, "dude".	What's the deal?
Help me with this guy.	It's like you said, every man for himself.
They're all over the place! What the hell's going on?	Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war.
What's this?	This is a gift. From me to you.
I don't believe it! You can't shoot a cop in the middle of the street!	Had to do what I had to do.
I wish I could go.	We all do.
Are you all right?	No.  I'm#  I don't know if we can do this without Charles.
I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.	Were you now?
Let go.	Suit yourself.
Don't you knock?	They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
I lost him.	How?
Is that what you're looking for?	A piece.  Only a piece.
I'll find him.	ALIVE.
If I could make you understand.  If you could just be made to see it the way I do.  The way it's going to be.	The way what is going to be?
I wouldn't really have let you die, you know.  I just needed#	I know.
Give him an extra dollar.	Yes, sir.
Darling!	Hello#?
Darling!#you will be careful!?	Of course.
I will!  Goodbye, darling!	Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye, darling.	Goodbye, darling!
Darling!	Darling!
Surprised?	Surprised!
Ready, darling?	Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
Good night.	That's my good boy.
I hope you find this comfortable. This was Baron Victor's room.	It seems fine.
Well# we'll see.	Will there be anything else?
How long will this whole thing take?	A week.  Ten days at most.
There.	I beg your pardon?
Home!	Home.
But what you were doing?	Just putting up some tea.
It seems that way.  You didn't hear any music at all?	What?
What is this place?	Must be the music room.
Taking the book along?	Yes, I think we could all use a good laugh.
It's not enough.  More!  More, do you hear me?	What?
You can't win 'em all.	But there must be a reason. This is science, not art.
Original.	Give -- me -- your -- hand!
How's it going?	What did you find out?
Thanks#for all your help.	That's what we're paid for.
Come on, big fellow!	Is everything ready?
It's alive.  It's -- moving! It's -- breathing!  It's -- standing!  What is your name?	# It's.
Are you busy?	That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?
Oh, doctor!	Perhaps we'd better leave.
It wasn't me.	Look here -  if it wasn't you, and it wasn't you, and it wasn't me#
Oh, Doctor!	I think you've done it, master.
It looks that way.	What do you think we should do?
What are you going to do?	I think I'll#carry him.
Do you think you can sing it?	Me?  Sing?
All right -- give it to him!	Are you serious??
Did you do it?	I think so.
Good night, Doctor.	Good night!
Why, doctor#how wonderful for you.	Wonderful?  It's terrible! Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible!
What?	I say, it wouldn't be fair to you# or to me.
Yes, I have mine.	And I have mine.
Yes#yes, you have yours.	Why don't we talk inside?
Yes, I know.	It wouldn't be fair to her.
No, not sound.	There must have been someone else down here then.
I'm getting tired.	Why don't we all turn in?  It's been a long day.
How long is it so far?	Four
Yes, sir, name, please?	Food!
Do you think she might be interested in  someone?	Which one?
