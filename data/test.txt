They do not!
They do to!
I hope so.
She okay?
Let's go.
Wow
Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
No
I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"?  And you don't know how to quit?
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
The "real you".
What good stuff?
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
Thank God!  If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
What crap?
do you listen to this crap?
No...
Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."
You always been this selfish?
But
Then that's all you had to say.
Well, no...
You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
I was?
I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
Tons
Have fun tonight?
I believe we share an art instructor
You know Chastity?
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
Hi.
Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
She's not a...
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
Sure have.
Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
How do you get your hair to look like that?
You're sweet.
You have my word.  As a gentleman
I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
You got something on your mind?
Where?
There.
Well, there's someone I think might be --
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
Forget French.
That's because it's such a nice one.
I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
Right.  See?  You're ready for the quiz.
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
Let me see what I can do.
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
That's a shame.
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
Why?
Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
Cameron.
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
Forget it.
You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.
I did.
You think you ' re the only sophomore at the prom?
I don't have to be home 'til two.
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
All I know is -- I'd give up my private line to go out with a guy like Joey.
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
Bianca, I don't think the highlights of dating Joey Dorsey are going to include door-opening and coat-holding.
Combination.  I don't know -- I thought he'd be different.  More of a gentleman...
Is he oily or dry?
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
Great
Joey.
Who?
Where did he go?  He was just here.
You might wanna think about it
No.
Did you change your hair?
You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
Hi, Joey.
Hey, sweet cheeks.
My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
Neat...
It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
Queen Harry?
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
Hopefully.
Exactly  So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
Expensive?
It's more
Perm?
Patrick -- is that- a.
It's just you.
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
No! I just wanted
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
I just wanted --
You set me up.
Let go!
So did you
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
I guess I'll never know, will I?
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
That's not
No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
Why didn't you tell me?
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
But
Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.
You did what?
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
As in...
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
But you hate Joey
He was, like, a total babe
Why?
In 9th.  For a month
What?
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
Like you care.
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
You're welcome.
I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
Can we go now?
You are so completely unbalanced.
Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
What's normal?
You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.
I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.
What do you think?
Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
Can you at least start wearing a bra?
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
Where've you been?
I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
I'm missing something.
Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
No, but
The prom?  Kat has a date?
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
Because she'll scare them away.
Why?
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
Just for a minute
Daddy, no!
Wear the belly before you go.
It's just a party. Daddy.
Oh, God.  It's starting.
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going --
Otherwise known as an orgy?
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
And where're you going?
Daddy, I --
Exactly my point
But she doesn't want to date.
But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!
Then neither will you.  And I'll get to sleep at night.
What if she never starts dating?
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating.  End of discussion.
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
Just sent 'em through.
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
Never
Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in?
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
Always a pleasure, Brucie.
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
No, I ' m not.
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
You told me that part already.
It's her favorite band.
Assail your ears for one night.
Okay!  I wasn't sure
He's pretty!
Dead at forty-one.
Her favorite uncle
It's a lung cancer issue
Number one.  She hates smokers
Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
Will Bogey get bent?
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
You got him involved?
Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
I thought you hated those people.
You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side.
That's what I just said
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not?
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz...
He seems like he thrives on danger
What makes you think he'll do it?
You wanna go out with him?
What about him?
Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point?
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
That's her?  Bianca's sister?
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
You could consecrate with her, my friend.
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
You know French?
Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
He always have that shit-eating grin?
Because they're bred to.  Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to date until her older sister does.  And that's an impossibility.
Why not?
Bianca Stratford.  Sophomore. Don't even think about it
Who is she?
You burn, you pine, you perish?
That girl -- I --
Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
That I'm used to.
Couple thousand. Most of them evil
How many people go here?
Get out!
Thirty-two.
How many people were in your old school?
Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
I was kidding. People actually live there?
North, actually.  How'd you   ?
So -- which Dakota you from?
C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the tour.
So they tell me...
You the new guy?
You get the girl.
What's the worst?
Where?
She kissed me.
You makin' any headway?
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
What'd you do to her?
Then, go get her
Sure
Cameron -- do you like the girl?
She's partial to Joey, not me
What 're you talking about?
It's off. The whole thing.
Cameron, I'm a little busy
Don't make me do it, man
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
What've you got for me?
Yeah -- we'll see.
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
And why would I do that?
Leave my sister alone.
Your sister here?
Away.
Where ya goin?
Not at all
Hey -- do you mind?
They're running the rest of me next month.
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers.  Another hundred for the tux --
Get her to act like a human
Do what?
How'd you do it?
A deal's a deal.
It's about time.
Forget her sister, then.
Forget it.
A hundred bucks a date.
What?
I just upped my price
I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
I'm on it
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
Fifty, and you've got your man.
Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation.
Fine, thirty.
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
How much?
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend.  And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
You got it, Verona.  I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
You need money to take a girl out
You just said
Sure, Sparky.  I'll get right on it.
Yeah, whatever.  I want you to go out with her.
Two legs, nice rack...
What do you think?
Yeah
Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested.
What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
You and Verona?
Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend*
I hear you're helpin' Verona.
So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her.  Someone who's up for the job.
Does this conversation have a purpose?
But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?
We're not.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
We don't chat.
Nope - just came by to chat
Are you lost?
Hey.
Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
William - he asked me to meet him here.
Who?
Have you seen him?
Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
You didn't
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
I didn't have a choice.
You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
Who cares?
What'd he say?
No fear.
You think this'll work?
If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any school you want, precious.  Don't forget your tiara."
Does it matter?
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?
Neither has his heterosexuality.
That's never been proven
William didn't even go to high school
William would never have gone to a state school.
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.
You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.
An attempted slit.
What's this?
Just a little.
Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
Block E?
He always look so
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
Who's that?
Don ' t you even dare. . .
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
Because I like to torture you.
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
Is that right?
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
I didn't care about the money.
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
It wasn't like that.
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
Wait I...
It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
That ' s completely adorable!
That's where I was last year.  She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her.  I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl.  I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune.  End of story.
What?
My grandmother's .
Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
Oh huh
It's just something I had.  You know
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
Nothing!  There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
Answer the question, Patrick
You need therapy.  Has anyone ever told you that?
You tell me.
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?
Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
Why not?
No, I won't go with you
No what?
No.
You know what I mean
Is that a request or a command?
Go to the prom with me
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
No one else knows
What?
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
I hate peas.
Tell me something true.
I know the porn career's a lie.
Hearsay.
The duck?
Fallacy.
State trooper?
For. . . ?
You up for it?
You never disappointed me.
How?
Then you screwed up
Something like that
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
Yes
Acting the way we do.
So what's your excuse?
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
A soft side? Who knew?
I dazzled him with my wit
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
Good call.
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect.  And piss you off.
The Partridge Family?
Maybe.
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
Put your right foot there --
Try lookin' at it from this angle
C'mon.  It's not that bad
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
Look up, sunshine
He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
So what did I have an effect on ?
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
Unwelcome?  I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
Unwelcome.
Wholesome.
Pleasant?
You 're so --
I heard there was a poetry reading.
What are you doing here?
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique?  I lost my copy.
No offense, but you're sister is without.  I know everyone likes her and all, but ...
BIANCA
Who?
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?
I'm gettin' there
Oh, so now you think you know me?
You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
My father wouldn't approve of that that
Start a band?
This.
Do what?
I should do this.
Why'd you lie?
Then why'd you ask?
No, you weren't
Maybe.
Were you in jail?
Busy
When you were gone last year -- where were you?
But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
And I'm in control of it.
What?
Kat! Wake up!
You know what they say
I thought you were above all that
Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
I hate him.
Dorsey.
Who?
Why'd you let him get to you?
Just let me sit down.
See that?  Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
Like you could find one
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
Why?
Sure, I do
You don't care if I die
I told you
Why 're you doing this?
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
This is so patronizing.
What if you have a concussion? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. Not that I could tell the difference...
I know, just let me sleep
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
I just need to lie down for awhile
You're not okay.
I'm fine. I'm
Okay?
Funny, you're the only one
I say, do what you wanna do.
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
What's this?
Why, don't you?
You know who The Raincoats are?
You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.
Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it for me.
That's what you want, isn't it?
Excuse me?

hey.  Great show, huh?
Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
You're not a big talker, are you?
Hi
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
Are you following me?
Seven-thirty?
You -- covered in my vomit.
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
And why would I do that?
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
You hate me don't you?
I know a lot more than that
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back.
Oh, right.  Friday.
Pick you up Friday, then
My mission in life.
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'?
Oh, Christ.  Don't tell me you've changed your mind.  I already sent 'em a check.
When I go?
You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives.  It means we've become spectators.  Bianca still lets me play a few innings.  You've had me on the bleachers for years.  When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.
No -- impressed.
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
Bianca did what?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Which parts?
Parts of it.
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
No, Daddy.
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food.  Is this something I should be hip to?
Funny.
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
Was that your sister?
I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
You're eighteen.  You don't know what you want.  You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
So what I want doesn't matter?
As a parent, that's my right
Because you're making decisions for me.
Why can't we agree on this?
I thought you were punishing me.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
Then tell them I had a seizure.
My insurance does not cover PMS
Enough!
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
You decided.
I thought we decided you were going to school here.  At U of 0.
I know.
Just smack her now.
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?
No ... I believe "heinous bitch" is the term used most often.
Tempestuous?
The point is Kat -- people perceive you as somewhat ...
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
Well, yes, compared to your other choices of expression this year, today's events are quite mild.  By the way, Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation went quite well, in case you're interested.
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
Yeah...
Kat a fan, too?
Right.
Macbeth, right?
Oh yeah.
You think?
Yeah.  I guess.
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
Hi.
Hey there.  Tired of breathing?
Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. People can hear you.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
You were right. She's still pissed.
No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
So you got cozy with she who stings?
I'm likin' you guys better
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
Yeah.
Ever been to Club Skunk?
Just for now.
Are you telling me I'm a -  "non-smoker"?
Good enough.
What?!
We're your guys.
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture.  Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.
So Dorsey can get the girl?
That's where we can help you.  With Kat.
Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure.  Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.
What is it with this chick?  She have three tits?
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
What plan?
Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
What?
Say it
See you next week!
You're completely demented.
Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
What's to discuss?
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
I'm at a loss, then.  What should we talk about? Your year of absence?
Touch of the flu.
I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
With the teeth of your zipper?
It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch.
It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls.
I missed you.
That ' s what I thought
Absolutely not.
Did I have anything to say about it?
Your daughters went to the prom.
What just happened?
But -- who -- what --?
Have a great time, honey!
Dr. Ruth?
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
Kissing?  Is that what you think happens?  Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
They'll dance, they'll kiss, they'll come home.  Let her go.
Pirate -- no question.
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
You're not helping.
Tumescent!
Jesus!  Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
What's a synonym for throbbing?
Make anyone cry today?
In the microwave.
I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
Akta dedero ansila do mektet.
No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.
Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!
You know exactly where they are!
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
The case was stolen?
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
The case..with the stones... Where is it?
Napoleon... small.
What're you laughing about?
At your service.
Corn-i-Lius?
Appipulai Leeloo Minai..
I know...
You are a monster, Zorg!
Let me reassure you Father..I will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years.
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
Father, by creating a little destruction, I am, in fact, encouraging life!  So, in reality, you and I are in the same business!
They are robots!
...Look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. Notice how each one is useful. What a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  So full of..life!
Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass.
No thank you.
...would you like a drink?
Ah, Father... You are so wrong. Let me explain...
...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
Why?  What's wrong with me?
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again
I'm fucked!
...We're saved!
That's what I'm saying.
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!
Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?
Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?
When is she not in trouble?
Leeloo's in trouble?
Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.
Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
What are you doing?
Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
Of course.
Good luck..
We have to save the world.
What kind of mission?
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.
That's what I thought.
It means, "Never without my permission".
Excuse me! Just one thing!  She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
I know. I was there when she arrived.
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
Dallas. Korben Dallas.
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
She's an exception..
They all like this in your family, father?
Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
So you do know her.
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
You noticed...
He's a she!
The girl?
I brought the girl remember?
Who are you?
She dropped in on me... holding this.
That's me.  But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here.
Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
What are we going to do?
Thank you, Mr. President.
Did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  You can't even tell me what it is! I ask you for options you give me bullshit. Give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.
White turns to black.  Light to Dark. Life to Death.  For all eternity.
But what happens if instead of this... Ultimate Warrior... it is EVIL who stands here?
Yes..thank God..
Is there anything that can stop it?
And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.
And then?
We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
That's exactly what we are going to try and do: Protect the lives of some 200 billion of our fellow citizens! General? You may fire when ready.
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!
One more reason to shoot first eh?
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.
Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
It's all my fault.  I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!
On the plane... with Mr. Dallas... the real one.
Where's Leeloo?
Good work, my son.  Now all we need is a way to get there.
I got it!  Everything  here we need to know about Fhloston Paradise Hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
Perfect.
They really made her...
I didn't know your size.
There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names...
Yes. Of course..
Uh father, I know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..
Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
What's she doing?
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?
The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!
Father, will you please explain what's going on?
I can't wear these clothes! This calls for dignity! I have to dress the part!
What is?
It's a miracle!!!
They are... with me...
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
I would like to have died in peace...
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
I don't have time... I need to know.
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
Do you love her?
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
She was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. You have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!
...So Cornelius was telling the truth!
Yes, and more than that... You must give her the Stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
Leeloo... is... she's...
The Fifth Element... The Supreme Being... Your wife...
Who?
You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...
Leeloo..
Uh huh..and I don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
5'7", green eyes... long legs... great skin... perfect..
So, just how big was this fare?
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
Hello?
In your dreams! See you tonight!
Uh... at least fifty.
How many points you got left on your license?
Finger!  I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
You forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. I know how you drive.
I don't need one.
Like shit.
How do I look?
I just found a picture of you.
Don't exist bud.
I don't want a million - I just want one.  A perfect one.
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
At least, the cat comes back.
Oh, yeah, I forgot.You still prefer your cat to the real thing.
I was talking to the cat.
I love you too Major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.
Hey bud! Finger here.
Yeah?
...Leeloo.
Hey,  that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai Ekbat De Sebat.
...What's your name?
I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured...
Eto Akta Gamat!
Vito Cornelius?
Vito... Cor... Ni-lious... Priest...
You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
...Priest...
It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!
...'Scuse me?
Akina delutan, nou-shan.
We will be ready, Lord.
When EVIL returns so shall we.
Time is of no importance, only life is important.
Knowing mankind as I do, that could take centuries!
When mankind comes to its senses. We will return.
Will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
Take them and put them in a safe place.
The Fifth Element...
Don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor mother with your own hands!
...Ma???
You little sleaze bag!
Hello?
...Not yet.
Have you pulled yourself together?
Yeah?
They've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour, blockhead!
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!
All I want is an explanation! I just got in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab. I got mugged, but other than that everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!! Now settle down and explain to me calmly..
I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?
...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!
Other than that... You all right?
Yes ma..
Are you listening to me, you ingrate!
I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.
Hi Ma...
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
...Hello?
Found it?
6... 5...
Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
30 seconds...
This is a police control action..
I'm sorry..
Thanks for reminding me..
You have nine points left on your license..
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...
How you doing this morning?  Sleep OK? I didn't.
Welcome on board Mr. Dallas..
Yeah... then I sighed... like this.
Is that all?
Look, you did something that set it off. Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me exactly what you did!!
Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
What did you say? What did you do?
Dear listeners, your favorite DJ is alive and kicking. It's seven o'clock and time for the news. Tune in tomorrow for another adventure.
Solid little jobs, aren't they?
Fuck it! Hold tight!
I don't even know what I'm looking for!
It's like a cab isn't it?
You know how to fly this thing?
I'll be right back.
Like Korben, can I have 30 seconds of your time here?
Not without Leeloo.
Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?
We got to find the leader. Mangalores don't fight without a leader.
He's on vacation.
Six to the left. One to the right.
Got it...
You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?
I didn't have a dad... never saw him... never even heard him. 50 billion people listen to me every day... and he doesn't hear me...
Yeah, very big, a giant.
...You got brothers and sisters? What about your dad? Tell me about your dad! What was he like? Physically? Big, I suppose?
I don't think this is a good time...
Oh, yes! Do that! You treat me right, man. Tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
My main man! Please don't leave me here alone. My head's killing me and my adoring fans are gonna tear me apart! Get me outta here!
Crystal.
I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal?
Uh... not really.
...Quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! You'll know everything there is to know about the D-man. His dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates.  And from what I'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. So tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?
Does it get any better or what!
...Hi.
Oh, yes you will...
Three of us will never fit in there!
...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.
I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex.. if she sees you here I'm finished.  She hates you guys. It's what killed us in the first place. Please...
I thought you were divorced.
It's my wife.
What is it?
...Shit!
One reason... I want to stay the only one left alive.
Why not?
I'm not going.
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
You have won the annual Gemini contest and a trip to Fhloston Paradise. For two. Congratulations. Here are your tickets.
I've had enough good news for today
Don't you open your messages?
You're the only one left alive...
And the third one?
Two: Of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.
Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission.
Just one... why me?
You're to leave immediately for Fhloston Paradise. Retrieve four Stones from the Diva Plavalaguna. And bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. Any questions'?
Where have I heard this song before?
To save the world.
What mission?
Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.
I love you...
Tell me...
Because...
Why?... Why would you need me?
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life.
But I don't know love... I'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own.
Exactly.
...Like love...
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!
Leeloo! Listen to me! I'll take you on a vacation afterwards! A real vacation, this time, for as long as you want. Come on! You can do it!
I want to sleep... forever...
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
I'm so tired...
It's up to you now, Angel!
...The rain falls...
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
The wind blows... the fire burns...
Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
Protect life... Until death.
I told you not to read all that crap!
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
I'm so very sad.
The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.
You're nothing but a... a...
It's difficult.
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.
No, not at all!  I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
Where you going?
OK, you can turn around!
You noticed..
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
You get that off the screen?
You know women normally change five times more than men.
Here we go again...
...Hoppi-hoppa.
Uh...
Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
Apipoussan?
Apipoussan!
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
All 900.
Which one?
Learning language.
Finished what?
What is... Make Love?
Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..
Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!
Love...
Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
Apipoulai!
Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you.  It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.
Dinoine chagantakat!
Oh god!
Cornelius..
You hear that?
Uh..you're welcome.
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
I suppose that means "Hi" ?
Apipoulai!
Good philosophy..see good in bad.. I like..I prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
At least I won lunch.
You right that is bad.. but mathematically luck must change! Grandfather say: "It never rain every day." This is good news guarantee.. I bet you lunch!
The last two messages I got?  The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
How someone strong like you scared from a message? Is good news I sure!
I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
Not going to open?
You're welcome..
Thanks..
You gotta push the little yellow button...
It's not?
You know you could hurt someone with this puppy..good thing it's not loaded..
Uh..
Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?
Don't fuck with me man or I'll blow you into tomorrow!
Been here long?
The cash man!
It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.
Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.
An elephant couldn't crack it.
This thing solid?
Wonderful!
...This is the crucial phase, The reconstruction of pigment. Cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. That means growing skin. Clever, eh?
We put it through the cellular hygiene detector. The cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.
Is there any danger? Some kind of virus?
The compositional elements of his DNA chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. His knowledge is probably limitless..
Yes... I can't wait to meet him.
Sounds like a freak of nature to me.
This cell is like a huge library. It has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. Almost like it was...engineered.
Talk English Doc.
It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
Have you identified it?
Actually only one cell survived..
This is all that survived?
How much time is left?
They just landed in the desert.
Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
I want your best man on this!
...What do you mean?
The-Stones weren't aboard the ship.
And the Stones?  Did you find them in the wreckage?
I managed to contact the Mondoshawan. They deplore the incident, but accept our apologies.
I'm about to, Mr. President.
Staedert?  What's going on?  Did you destroy it?
Gentlemen?
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
Recommendations.
Wait or act.
Options.
Not yet Sir..The only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
What you are saying is you don't know what this..thing..is.
There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
Perfect, Mr. President.
Is that better?
I can hear you, Mr. President, but I can't see you .
Staedert, do you read me?
To fame.. salud..
Drink!
Then let us toast to your fame!  Here Billy..
A weapon against evil.  Amazing!  I am going to be famous.
Only too well... here you must be parched..
Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.
Amen..
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..
I'm not at the hotel!
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
Yes, Sir!
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
How's that? Can you hear me better now?
...I can't wait to be among you.
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.
How's our deal coming along?
Got it.
Do you have the picture now Mr. Zorg?
Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
...Not far, now.
No... not at all.  Where are you?
Am I disturbing you?
Commissioner, Aquarius.
Kruger, Sagittarius.
I was asking McCrosky, Commissioner.
Some southern plantation owner falls in love with this poor...
What's the story?
I was reading too.
Forget it.  I was reading.
You've made your point, Commissioner. There's only one other pilot who can handle that shuttle and that's Clarence Oveur.  He's got a lunar flight today.  I want him pulled.  Jacobs, pull Oveur!
I told you, leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys down...
I wonder how your boys in Washington are going to take this one.
That just doesn't make any sense.
That's right, Commissioner.  Senselessly murdered just minutes ago.
I just wish it was that simple.
What?
Commissioner.
You handle your front office people, I'll handle the press and leave the boys in Washington to the boys downtown and the boys downtown to the boys on the board.
Bud, get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown.
And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner?  Let <u>me</u> talk to them.
Forget it.  The boys on the board want that shuttle to go on schedule.
Commissioner, we both know the Mercury shuttle needs another month of pre-launch testing.
Um...  Do you people scream right when you... you know.
What is it, Mary?
Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
Felt like a large asteroid.
Yes I did...
Did you feel that?
You better take this.
Sir?
Dunn.
You better check on it, Mr. Dunn.  I'll stay here and fly the ship.
Sir, I've got an overload in disposal unit four.
You better check it, Unger.
We seem to have a malfunction in disposal unit four, sir.
Accelerators down.
Shut down accelerators.
Dunn.
Oveur.
Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.
Ted, the lever!
Compute!
Now!
Set!
We've blown the computer!  Elaine!  Set course change!
I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
Are you afraid?
The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds.  He'll roast like a pig on a spit.
What will happen to him, Ted?
That's right -- premature ejection.
You mean...
Sit down, Elaine.  If this bomb trick works we just might make it.  Simon was a fool to eject now.
Simon just ejected!
That might be the news we've been waiting for.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
That was very well put, Ted.
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place.  You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly.  You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.
I mean until we start to burn up.
Not now, Elaine.
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
Ted, please be careful.
Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.
Ted, there's no time to explain.
Elaine, what's going on?
Ted!
Elaine!
Ted, a toilet's not going to kill anyone.
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
I'd use the word insane.
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
What word would you use, Elaine?
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.
Elaine, I mean the mission has to be aborted.  This ship should never have passed FSA inspection.  This thing is held together by string and chewing gum.
We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.
Elaine, we have to go back.
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
Elaine.
Ted!
Not now, Elaine!
Ted.
I've got it, Elaine!  I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
What are you doing, Ted?
Let me by, Elaine.
Ted, we're taking off!
I have to get in there.  I have to stop this flight.
Ted!  What are you...?
Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you.
That's the way I want it.  Just turn the radio on and go.
If that's the way you want it.
No goodbyes, Elaine.  Just go.
Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.
His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.
And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.
Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.
Sammy Davis Junior.  Terrible car accident.  He hasn't been the same since.
Who's that, Ted?
Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.
Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.
Elaine, what happened to us?
Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.
Elaine.
You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine!  It's all here in the design specifications!  Look!  It's all here!
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
There's nothing wrong with me!
Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.
Ask Simon.
Ted, what's wrong?
I mean the Mercury flight.  It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why.
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
It's got to be stopped!
That's not important now, Elaine.  We have to talk.
Te...!
Elaine.
Yes -- last week that pile of mud was only this high.
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.
Is that a good sign, Doctor?
You can be gentle with him, Elaine.  He's been working out a lot of his aggressions here in the garden.
I mean for Ted.
You can eat balanced meals, exercise, and take Geritol.
What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?
So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.
The human brain is a highly complex organ, Elaine, perhaps the most complex next to the bladder.  Let me show you.  Ted's problem is in this area.  This area, this area, here, here, here, under here, here...
Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.
Simon, what are you saying?!
Maybe.
Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there.
Your career!  What about the lives of those people out there.  Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?
My career is shot.
We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.
Can't we change course?
He tried to disconnect ROK.  It gassed him.  That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.
Simon, what's happening?!
Roger.
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
That's my girl.
I think so.
Have you got it straightened out now?
Don't be too long.
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
So mentally ill?
Simon, why has he become so... so...
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
No, I've been excited before.
I guess this is a first for you.
I'm so excited, Simon.
Frank's the best pilot in the program.
You're heading up the division in charge of babies for Mr. and Mrs. Simon Kurtz.
But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
Women <u>and</u> the space program have come a long way, sweetheart.  But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.
And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman.
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
Simon.
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
Roger.  You better get back there and monitor the regulatory unit.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
I'd rather sit down for this one, Elaine.
You can do it from up here, Captain.
Roger.
We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system.
I see.  What do you think our alternatives are?
I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.
Yes, sir.
Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.
There's nothing wrong with me, Elaine. What about tonight -- just you and me.  We can be alone.  I can get rid of everyone else on the ship -- I've already proven <u>that</u>.
Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.
Request; life support systems check.
Systems check positive.  Look, Elaine, I...
Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.
You have great tits.
Go ahead.
Can I say something of a personal nature to you?
That's okay, ROK.
Elaine, I'm sorry about that little outburst a moment ago.
Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this.
That's not possible.
Negative.
That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.
Negative.
Intermitant failure in scan mode "R". Analyze.
Look, a man can make an honest mistake!! Anyway, she was asking for it!  They're all asking for it all the time!!
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.
It's going to be terrific.  A whole new world, new kids to play with.
Do you think things will be a lot different on Mercury, Dad?
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.
We'll have to check, Jimmy.  It's a pretty long trip to Mercury.
Will Scraps be able to sit with us, Dad?
Do you like it when Scraps sleeps on his back, Jimmy?
Yeah.
He's a boy dog.
Sure.
Can I hold him?
Scraps.
Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name?
What...?
All right.  Here.
Okay, Joey.  The Doc says you gotta relax. This hospital in Des Moines is the best sex clinic in the country.
I don't want to hear that word!
Joey, what's more important, the kids' clothes or your sexual potency.
We've spent everything on these operations.  Is it really worth it?  We've pawned your mother's wedding ring.  The kids have no winter clothes...
Take this, Joey.  It's my last few bucks. You'll need a hot meal when you get there.
I'm sure.
You're sure?
That's right, Joe.  Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
What?
Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids.  You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
I don't want to live anymore.
Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people.
Have you tried it with a little cinnamon?
Captain, the coffee machine is jammed and I don't like it.
Poached!  Not over!  Over!
All right, Captain Oveur.  Over.
That's how I want them.  Poached.  Over.
Just poached on toast.  Over.
Poached <u>and</u> over, Captain Oveur?  Over.
No.  Poached.  Over.
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.
Anything.  Just don't let Salucci think we're onto him.
What should I say?
No, a bomb.  Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge.
A b...
He's carrying a bomb.
Sixteen 'C', why?
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down.
Whenever your're ready, Captain.
Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger, and your first officer, Mr. Dunn.
Good to be aboard, gentlemen.
Do you think it's necessary to explain <u>everything</u>?
That's how dry cleaning works.  Now I'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians.
We don't have much time.  Let's move. I'll explain everything.
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
Captain Oveur?
Now he's D-Y-I-N-Ging and wants to be buried on Mercury.
Ah, yes, the Institute, I'm familiar with it.
Let's go, Daddy.  We have to check in.  He was never appreciated at the Institute.
It's a privilege to meet you, sir, I'm familiar with all your work.
Yes.
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
You folks need any help?
But that's not a door.  The door's over there.
Don't try to stop me!
You can't go in there!
Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.
All right, it's a matter of death.
You'll have to be more specific than that, sir.
No, dammit.  It's a matter of life or death.
Do you have an appointment, sir?
I have to see Bud Kruger.
Pull yourself together!  We've got to...
Don't talk to me about Elaine.  Outta my way!
Then Elaine was right.
That damn computer has taken over.  I'm getting out.
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
Striker.
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.
That's right, Striker.  And we're getting married when we return.
Are you on the Mercury mission?
Well, we laughed.  We laughed all the time.
No.  It's hard to L-A-U-G-H when your father's dying.
I just wish it was that simple.  We really were in love.  You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
Then the relationship remains the same and the love changes only when there's change in the two people who share that love.
Sure.  But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
Not if the people change together in relation to that love.
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
Love's the same as it always was.  It's people who change.
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
No.  I mean your relationship.
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
Do you want to talk about it.
No, I mean your head.  Sit down.  I'll take a look at it.  I'm a nurse.
I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
You've been hurt.
You don't have to excuse yourself.  I'm a nurse.  I understand.
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
Yes.  He's dying <u>a-n-d</u> wants to be buried on Mercury.
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing.
Excuse me, are you alright?  I noticed you talking to yourself.  I'm a nurse.  Can I be of some help?
That's a very nice compliment, and I'd like to say that...you've done the same for me.
Just in case I don't have a chance to say goodbye, I want you to know that I haven't spent so many pleasant hours for many years.
No. I'm all alone.
I'm sure we'll both make it...but just in case one of us...well, is there a message you'd like me to give someone?
That's a lovely name. Mine's Milton...Milt Ettenhenim. But my friends call me 'Bubbles.'
Mine's Eleanor. Eleanor Schiff.
You know, here we are having coffee together, and discussing education and business and economy...and we don't even know each other's names...full names I mean.
I wish I could fool myself into believing that that's the reason. The truth of the matter is, nobody ever asked me.
I know the answer -- Career. A smart woman like you became so involved in your work, you didn't have time for marriage.
Well, I'm afraid that's a question that's all too easy to answer.
But I think it's time we stopped talking about me. A woman like you -- why haven't you ever married?
Well, after a thing like that you wouldn't be expected to.
After my wife died, I felt like a fifth wheel. You know, so many years being with one person -- a very wonderful person -- makes you always think of yourself as part of a pair...When Ethel passed away, I was lost. I couldn't function socially and I couldn't function in business.
No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
Were you vacationing in Los Angeles?
No, thank you. I take it black. Like my men.
Thank you. Cream?
Ah, won't you sit down?
That's very nice of you. Thank you.
I happened to be passing, and I thought you might like some corfee.
Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.
Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.
Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.
Something about a plane with no pilot?
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.
Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
Excuse me, Doc, I've got a plane to land.
And the last thing he said to me, "Doc," he said, "Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."
George Zipp said that?
I'm doing everything I can! -- And stop calling me Shirley!
Surely there must be something you can do.
I won't deceive you, Mister Striker. We're running out of time.
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
Will the hospital equipment be at the airport?
Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?
...safe and sound and free to pursue a life of religious fulfillment.
Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.
Elaine, I haven't time to put this gently, so I'll be very direct. Everyone of us on this plane is in a desperate situation. Mister Striker is the only hope we've got.
Well, I flew single-engine fighters in the Air Force, but this plane has four engines. It's an entirely different kind of flying...<u>all</u> <u>together</u>!!!
I <u>am</u> serious, and don't call me Shirley! What flying experience have you had?
Surely you can't be serious.
Can you fly this airplane and land it?
Both pilots!
I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
No, I mean we can't <u>land</u> for another two hours. Fog has closed down everything this side of the mountains. We've got to go through to Chicago!
You can't take a guess for another two hours?
Well...not for another two hours.
Can't you take a guess?
I can't tell.
Captain, how soon can we land?
I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.
No. No one that I know of.
Well...
All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
No.
Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?
Extremely serious. It starts with a slight fever.
Just how serious is it, doctor?
He had fish, too.
Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?
Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too.
He had fish.
What did he have?
Yes, yes, I remember. I had lasagna.
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
What was it we had for dinner tonight?
Certainly.
It's a big building with patients. But that's not important right now. Tell the Captain I must speak to him.
A hospital? What is it?
You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.
Yes. Yes, of course.
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
That's right.
Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?
Uh-huh.
See them, Elaine?
The gear is down.
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
Yes?
Ted...
I don't care. I just don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before.
But Ted, you're the only...
Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan.
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
Rats! I've lost number three.
It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
And a little ice!
And a little ice.
Rain.
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
A lot of people made plans before the war. Like George Zipp.
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!
That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.
What's his problem?
Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.
Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?
Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.
It's a big building where the generals meet. But that's not important right now. They've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid. Isn't that good news?
Headquarters!? What is it?
You got a telegram from headquarters today.
But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past!
That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us.
I remember everything. All I have are memories.
Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?
I love you.
I love you, Elaine.
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.
What's the matter?
You...you shouldn't have come. I don't have time now.
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
Ted, what are you doing here?
It's too late, Ted. When I get back to Chicago, I'm going to start my life all over again. I'm sorry.
But if you'll just give me...
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.
You expect me to believe that?
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.
Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over.
It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
I just don't want to go over it any more.
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
Ted!
Elaine!
Find out if there's a doctor on board, as quietly as you can.
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
Airsick?
Who wants to be first?
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.
Joey can stay up here for a while if he'd like to.
We'd better get back now.
Hello.
We have a visitor.
Good-bye, darling.
Good-bye, darling. I love you. I love you, darling.
Good-bye, darling.
Bill! Bill! Good-bye, Bill.
So long, darling. Good-bye. Take care of yourself.
Oh, Bill, I'll keep it. I'll keep it with me all the time.
Good-bye, darling.
Every day.
You promise you'll write.
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.
All right, he's on final now! Put out all runway lights except niner.
He's right on the heading.
Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather.
He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole!
You are now eight miles from the airport. Turn right to a heading of zero eight niner, throttle back slightly and begin to lose altitude to fifteen hundred feet.
Eight miles. Turn right to heading zero eight niner.
Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
Did you decide on a runway yet?
Yes, Captain?
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?
Here.
Oh Jack, I'm so warm. I'm burning up.
How ya doing, honey?
What is it?
Oh, I can't stand it.
Well, it wasn't all that I had hoped.
What did you think of 'Great Expectations?'
Yeah, I think he is.  Hey, Fred!
Jack, isn't that Fred Bliffert over there in the blue turtleneck? Maybe he's on our flight to Chicago.
The hell I don't! I'm out there busting my buns every night.
...and that you don't really try, except during the playoffs.
We are turning left to a heading of zero- niner-niner.
...and that lots of times you don't even run down court.
Denver Control, this is Flight two-zero- niner intersecting Victor Airway seven- niner-niner.
I think you're the greatest. But my Dad says you don't work hard enough on defense.
I'm an airline pilot.  Ah, Clarence, according to my calculations, with this tailwind we ought to be able to make up an additional fifteen minutes over the Rockies.
I think you should go back to your seat now, Joey. Right, Clarence?
You <u>are</u> Kareem. I've seen you play. My Dad's got season tickets!
I'm sorry, son, but you must have me confused with someone else. My name is Roger Murdock. I'm the co-pilot.
Wait a minute. I know you. You're Kareem Abdul Jabbar. You play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers!
Okay, this is one of my favorites.
Oh, I'd love to.
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
I'm Randy.
Hi!
Oh, it's nothing to be alarmed about. We'll get back to you very quickly.
Yes, of course. We both had fish. Why?
Well, the doctor will be with you in just a moment. One thing: do you know what he had for dinner?
Oh, Stewardess. My husband is very sick. Can you do something, please?
Yes?
I will, but Jim won't.
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?
All right. But just remember, my name is Roger Murdock.
No, he's not bothering anyone. Let him stay up here.
No, why don't you take care ot it?
Do you want me to check the weather, Clarence?
Roger, Roger. What's our vector, Victor?
We have clearance, Clarence.
Huh?
Roger.
Huh?
Roger.
Hi, Roger. Good to have you aboard. Victor, this is Roger Murdock.
Sorry, Clarence. Latest weather report shows everything socked in from Salt Lake to Lincoln.
Of course.
Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
Yes?
Excuse me, Sister?
Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.
Mr. Striker, the passengers are ready.
Would you go up, please?
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.
It's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit. But that's not important right now. The first officer is ill and the Captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio. Do you know anything about planes?
The cockpit? What is it?
Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...
No. No thank you.
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?
Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
Do you feel all right, sir?
Thank you.
Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.
Thank you.
I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.
You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?
What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
How did he look?
The American? Yes, duck.
Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?
I doubt it. But it's something to do.
David?
Nurse Hobbs said there's a disturbance in Leicester Square involving some sort of mad dog.
Tea would be nice.
What shall we do?
I expect you shortly.
No, a cab will be faster.
Shall I send a car?
He's fine. We'll come right over.
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
Yes, Doctor.
Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?
Yes, I should think so.
Could you get here without any trouble?
No, not really.
Is David acting strangely?
No, why?
Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
The zoo? Is he rational?
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
He's here.
Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.
What shall we do?
Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
Dr. Hirsch?
David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
Surely you're not suggesting...
No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.
You've absolutely no idea where David might be?
I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf.
And what else?
They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
Yes.
I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
Warn him?
David says Jack comes to warn him.
What did he say?
Yes.
Has his friend appeared to him again?
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
He's not?
At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
It's a full moon. Where is he?
Yes, sir.
Oh dear girl, your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me. I don't give a damn who you sleep with. I'm concerned about David.
Come to my office, Miss Price.
It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.
Yes, I believe he did.
Did he say a wolf?
No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor.
The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.
What happened to them?
That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
He said 'Jack'.
What exactly did he call out?
Yes, Doctor?
Oh, Miss Price?
Yes, Doctor.
Go about your duties.
Dr. Hirsch?
Can I be of service, Miss Price?
Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital.
Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.
Control!?! What control!?! Get away from me!
David, don't lose control.
Leave me alone, dammit! You people are crazy! I've got to get away from here! I've got to do something!
David, let's go now.
Hopeless. It's hopeless.
Will you shut up!?!!
Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and...
I swear, I don't know this girl.
We had an argument. He's being silly.
What?
He's playing a stupid joke, sir.
Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!
David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.
Jack is dead. Look, six people have been killed. I'm going to the police.
Jack is dead!
I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I...
David, stop!
Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
David, what are you doing?
Pull over.
But...
I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
I should be committed.
The next corner we can get a cab.
I said goodbye to you. I was locked out of the flat. I climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window. I started to read and then I was naked at the zoo!  I guess I am out of my fucking mind.
Don't you remember?
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
The zoo?
Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!
I'm freezing.
David! Where on earth have you been!?!
See you later.
I'm off. There's food in the fridge.
A doper werewolf.
I've left those pills for you.
Okay.
Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?
Yeah, I do, but go to work.
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
Werewolves simply do not exist.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
Anything.
Do me an enormous favor?
Let me go now, you'll make me late.
That's good, Alex.  Reassure me.
Tomorrow is the full moon.
I wasn't hallucinating.
But, David.
I was awake and he was in my room.
David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?
Good.
Of course.
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
Yes?
Alex?
It's nice to see you.
It's nice to see you.
David, perhaps you'd like to watch the telly while I take a shower.
There is only one bed.
The bedroom.
Lovely.
Bathroom.
Charming.
Closet.
Very nice.
The kitchen.
Yeah, I would think so, too.
I would think so.
I was dreaming again?
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
Your dead friend Jack?
My friend Jack was just here.
You're to be discharged tomorrow. Will you be all right?
I'll let you know the next full moon.
Are you better now?
A werewolf?
I'm a werewolf.
Good. I thought for a moment I was the only embarrassed one in the room.
Now I'm embarrassed.
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.
You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
Not just a patient -- me.
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
Will you think about it?
Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
What?
Will you come with me?
David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.
I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.
That's easy enough.
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Hello. You all right?
Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking. We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd...
Yes, go on.
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
What? Oh, yes, please.
Shall I read to you?
My best friend. My very best friend.
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
Now what do you want to talk about?
I know.
I'm twenty-seven.
Twenty-eight.
How old are you?
That's not really a very proper question.
How old are you?
It's okay. I want to talk to you.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
I dream of death mostly.
What do you dream about?
I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.
Do you like it?
'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
I was. What are you reading?
I thought you were asleep.
You're a very beautiful girl.
Will you give me a break?
Let's try a little harder, shall we?
Right.
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
Call me David.
Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler?
Aw come on, Alex!
Call me Alex.
Aw come on, Miss Price!
Sorry.
Leave the pills. I'll take them later.
Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?
How is that?
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
Please, really. I'm not hungry.
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
You haven't eaten your lunch.
Yes?
Mr. Kessler?
A wolf.
What?
It was a wolf.
I beg your pardon?
It wasn't a lunatic.
I thought not.
No.
Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?
No!
No what?
No.
How are we feeling tonight?
Right.
No.
The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
No.
Feeling better?
No.
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
No.
No what?
No.
Hello, Benjamin.
Really, Susan, I don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice now.
I looked.
Why on earth do you say that?
I think he's a Jew.
Chart says he's from New York.
He's an American, you know. Dr. Hirsch is going to fetch round one of those Embassy fellows to see him.
Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
He all right?
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
Has he been refusing food?
Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
Miss Price.
That's what I want you to do, you moron!
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
Who is this girl?
Shakespeare was French! The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell! Shit! Fuck! Piss!
Now see here young man.
Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!
There's no call for that kind of language.
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
All right, you two, move along.
You did, did you?
Officer, I killed those people last night.
Why are you doing this to me?
No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.
That's easy for you to say - you're already dead.
You've left my wife a widow and my children fatherless. And I understand that I am to walk the earth one of the living dead until the wolf's bloodline is severed and the curse lifted.
Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
Why are you doing this to me, Jack?
You could have told them!
No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!
That's very funny, that is.
Oh, all right. There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York. It was full of men from the United Nations.
No. You've had your chance.
Oh, come on, tell us.
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.
Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!
You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.
No, but we're about to.
Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?
Bambi?
Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
Some, everyone does.
Do you have bad dreams, too?
An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.
What are you going to see?
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
Alex?
It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
What time is it?
Now go back to sleep so you'll be fresh for Dr. Hirsch in the morning.
I was having a nightmare.
Mr. Kessler? Wake up, please.
Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
Dr. Hirsch?  I'd rather not be by myself.
Believe me. The Hound of the Baskervilles was an invention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's. And if you'd read the bloody book, you'd find that Holmes discovered your house of hell a fraud, a fake.
You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
I really don't know.
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
Did you see Jack?
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
Yes.
I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?
Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
You've never had bad dreams before?
Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about.
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.
So they said.
There were witnesses?
Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now. Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now.
Lunatic?
You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten.
Two weeks?
You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
How long have I been here?
Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
Miss Price! Miss Price, please!
Now, David, I want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead.
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
You're in a hospital in London.
Where am I?
Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins.
If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death.
I could hang myself.
How shall I do it?
Because this must be stopped.
Gerald is the man you murdered in the subway. We thought it best you didn't see him as he's a fresh kill and still pretty messy.
Hello.
David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.
I want you to meet some people.
Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.
What about the zoo?
I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
Thank you.
You look awful.
If I was still alive, I probably would.
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
You don't have to say anything.
What can I say, Jack?
Hi, David.
Hi, Jack.
I will not accept this! Now go away!
The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!
What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit!
You must believe me.
I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
What do you think?
Jack, are you really dead?
You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.
A monster. I know, I know.
David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...
Get out of here, Jack!
Yes.
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
I wanted to see you.
What are you doing here?
Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.
You're not real.
It's cold, David, and I'm so alone. The undead surround me. Have you ever talked to a corpse? It's boring! I'm lonely! Kill yourself, David, before you kill others.
Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.
Nurse!
Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.
Nurse!
David, please believe me. You will kill people, David. You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins.
You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
Jack, please go away. Please go away.
Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.
Stop it, Jack.
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
What?!
It's you, David.
Will you be quiet?!
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
What's wrong with you? Shut up!
I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
Shut up, you zombie!
On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
I'm not listening!
We were attacked by a werewolf.
If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!
I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.
What?!
David!
I'm going completely crazy.
Life mocks me even in death.
Rudy Levine the shmuck?
So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.
I can't stand it.
Debbie Klein cried a lot.
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.
Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
David! You're hurting my feelings.
I'm aware that I don't look so great, but I thought you'd be glad to see me.
This is too much. I can't handle this.
Thanks a lot.
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
Nice to see you.
Are you going to help me up?
You really scared me, you shithead.
Well. I'm glad we... WHOAA!!
I'll tell you when we get there.
Where are we going?
Yeah.
Jack?
Not far enough. Come on.
It sounds far away.
No.
See anything?
Walking away, yes, sir. Here we are walking away.
Walk away, Jack.
Nice doggie. Good boy.
A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.
Oh shit. What is that?
Do you think it's a dog?
It's in front of us.
Let's just keep walking.
Plan?
What's the plan?
It's circling us.
It's moving.
Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving.
Come on, where?
I don't know. Come on.
Shit! David, what is that?
Yeah.
I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.
It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
No, but he was on the moors.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
Heathcliffe.
Pecos Bill.
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
There aren't any coyotes in England.
A coyote.
Yeah?
Could be a lot of things.
What was it?
I heard that.
Did you hear that?
I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you.
Say, David...
I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it, because they felt so silly.
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
I have no idea.
What do you think was wrong?
Well, not quite a blood-thirsty mob.
I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.
Come on, I'm freezing.
Beware the moon?
I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
What the hell was that all about?
Apparently so.
Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!
What do you mean? I'm starving.
Jack, we'd better go.
You ask them.
Go on, ask them.
Wrong.
Right.
I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.
You ask them.
Ask them what the candles are for.
Maybe the owners are from Texas.
It's a five-pointed star.
What about it?
Look at that.
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
Nice looking group.
Nice to see you.
Hello.
Shall we?
Okay.
I assume full responsibility.
David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
That's a wolf's head.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
The Slaughtered Lamb?
She says she 'likes me too much'.
We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.
Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
I don't know.
Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
You're talking about the woman I love.
She's a jerk.
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
Right.
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
Well, I like it here.
Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place?
You're not having a good time are you?
David.
Jack.
Good.
Yes.
Are you cold?
Stay here. If we need you, we'll know where to reach you.
What can we do to assist you?
Regardless of what you think, Lieutenant, the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him.
The forensic lads seem to feel that some sort of animal was involved, that's true, but I hardly think...
Why don't we ask him?
Has David Kessler anything to say concerning the attack on the moors?
You were saying?
Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
No, thank you, Doctor.
Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?
Dr. Hirsch?
Tell him I'm out. No, tell him I've passed away. An old war wound or something. Tell him I'm dead. And no more calls!
He's on the telephone.
What here?
Roger Mathison, Doctor.
Excuse me.  Yes?
Send them in.
Lt. Villiers and Sgt. McManus are here to see you, Doctor.
Yes?
I see. You've heard nothing about the incident?
Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.
What's that?
I suppose Guinness will suffice.
Sorry, love.
Campari and soda would do nicely.
Hello, there. What can I get you?
I beg your pardon?
Remember the Alamo?
But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
Oh.
No.
Then you have some hot tea?
We've got spirits and beer. If it's something hot you want, you can have tea.
Hot chocolate?
No.
Do you have any hot soup?
We'll find him, not to worry.
I cannot accept a connection between David Kessler and last night's murders. We will find him, however. I can assure you of that.
That is precisely my point. David, as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. We won't trouble you any further. Good day.
I don't rightly know, sir.
And what, Sergeant?
Lieutenant, the boy seems pretty lucid to me and...
Sgt. McManus, are you suggesting that David and Jack were, in fact, attacked by some animal and that the officialdom of East Proctor has conspired to keep it a secret? We have an autopsy report on the murderer who was shot in the act by the local police. We have two witnesses to the crime. You'll forgive me, Mr. Kessler, if I consider your testimony as coming from someone who has gone through a terrible shock.
He may have a point, Lieutenant. Two strong boys would be able to defend themselves against one man.
Has Mr. Kessler said anything regarding the attack on the moors?
Sorry.
I'd like some tea, please.
No, thank you.
Check out the other guy's buns.
Look at that guy. What a hunk.
Deb, I want to throw you a shower.
I'm totally blown away. You're getting married. It seems like only yesterday I showed you how to have oral sex.
Really -- you went with him for two years.
Does Cole know about this?
...Really?
Debbie's marrying Rick.
What's happening?
Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
Deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
I feel like I'm spying on Rick.
That's what we're going to find out...
Nah. Everything's cool... I took care of 'em. 
You're kidding.
I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.
What do you mean?
They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.
What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?
No. As far as they're concerned the only good Rick is a dead Rick. But I don't care... it's my decision.
He's not gonna be happy. And your parents can't be too thrilled either.
He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.
O'Neill just tole me. It's sooo great... I don't believe it.
Bobbie, what are you talking about?
Debbie... I don't believe it. I'm so excited.
Women!
I don't get it, but at least Gary's got the real stuff coming up here in a few minutes.
Sex is my one thing. I'm good at it.
Chulo, one thing at a time.
Where's the women, man? We gotta have women.
Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.
Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.
You're kidding.
What?
Yeah. What is it?
Rick's got an important announcement to make.
I'm glad you guys came by... What's the occasion?
Hey, man, congratulations!
Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro.
Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
Man, you're losing your audience.
Too bad, man, that blows my chance to be Ambassador to France.
I've decided not to run for President.
Great. I'll go with you. Wait a second. Hey, Raul! Move that car, will you?
We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
Hey, you guys, what's going on?
I'd like to jerk and press those babies.
Denmark makes great Nautilus equipment.
When do the girls get to the party?
All right!
What time are we supposed to get to the hotel?
I hope so. Hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
Yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
You sure Gary's got this whole party deal together?
Fan out and look for them.
He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: "24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!" Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters.
She's mine!
Cole, what the hell are you doing?
You've had it. I'm gonna get you.
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.
Shit!
Maybe it had something to do.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!
So does Debbie.
Low mileage... Handles like a dream.
Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
The car for Debbie?
I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie. An even swap.
I'm very happy for you two.
I love that car.
The best.
Great car.
See that down there? That's my most prized possession. My new Porsche.
Ooh, be still, my heart.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
Oh, come on, just a little.
I don't want any trouble.
Ah, Cole.  I don't remember ordering an asshole from room service.
Rick, I want to talk to you.
Thank you. We'll all keep that in mind. 'Bye now.
He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
Thanks, Dad.  Cole, go away.
What is this person's story here?
Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
I'm marrying Debbie.
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
Not interested.
Seventy-five hundred.
No.
Five thousand dollars.
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
Cole...
I want Debbie.
Cole. Don't you know it's bad luck to see the groom before the wedding?
Bond... James Bond.
And...
Not so good. He wouldn't listen to reason. He stole my car... my Porsche... I can't find it anywhere...
Fine. How's everything going?
Yes I did.
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
Mr. Thomerson.
Hello?
Yes, sir.
All right, I'll go up there and take care of this myself.  You look awful, son. Go find yourself some clothes.
1002.
Take hold of yourself. What room are they in?
The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down...
Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened?
Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise.
What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?
Keep me informed.
Thanks for the advise, sir.
If it were me, I'd reason with him first. Then, if that failed...  ...I'd take more persuasive action.
But how can I do that?
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
I've tried to change her mind.
Cole, I don't want you to give up on her.
Yes, sir, I am.
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
Thank you, sir.
Nice shot.
Sure have...
So, Cole, you been practicing your game?
Not at all. We're just finishing lunch.
Hi, everybody. Am I late?
I understand, Deb. 'Bye... be happy.
I'm going now, Cole.
That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.
Cole, I'm sorry, I...
You know how that makes me feel, Deb? Wanta know how that makes me feel?  Angry, Deb.  Yesss, that's the word, angry. But if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb.  No matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very, very happy.
I'm not. I just thought I should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else.
You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
No, Cole, I...
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
Cole, we've got to talk.
Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
Cole?
You're so romantic...
This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
Yeah.
Are you okay?
You're on.
Let's get naked.
Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
Yes...
See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?
You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
I don't believe you.
I am committed. I love you.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
I don't want that. I want to be with you.
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
Let go of me!
Rick, you're lying!
C'mon, I knew it was you.
I can't trust you!
Why don't you get undressed.
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around.
I love you.
Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
Have a good time. Don't make it too late.
Well, if I go back on my word, I'll kill her.
Your mother's not dead.
Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave.
You're really pissing me off.
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
Remember, you promised... no screwing around.
Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady.
Can't I just go with you guys?
This is it, lady. Last stop.
Gonna get married...
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
You better not have too much joy.
Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.
Um... that's very relaxing.
Good...
That feels so great.
C'mere.
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
About what?
I don't know... I just feel scared.
What's the matter?
Stop fooling around... I need to talk.
Oh... I got something for that.
I can't sleep.
Huh? Wha...
Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
Are you going to have women at your party?
Yes, but looks are deceiving...  Not in this case, however.
It looks awful.
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
You're going to have a bachelor party?
Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
Don't worry... it's supposed to do this.
I think your dinner's burning.
It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.
What are we having?
But a fabulous cook.
God, you're a slob.
I know what I'm doing... Go!
Ilene, are you crazy?
Look, girls -- I'll stay behind and hold them off. The rest of you break for it!
Let's go.
Debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men.
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
Are you sure this is a good idea?
Debbie, don't be naive. Men are pigs.
Ilene, Rick promised...
Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
If I were you, I'd worry less about the shower and more about Rick's bachelor party.
I hope those guys are all right.
I hope Ilene's all right.
Quiet, Mother.
What kind of job? I'm a housewife.
Ilene, we don't really know that.
A strange wang right in my palm.
You know your father enjoys his company.
Why is Cole here?
Great, Mom.
I'm using the same caterer for the shower I had for our Christmas party last year.
Any time, Al.
Thanks for helping us out, Ed. We appreciate it.
I think I screwed that one once.
Great bathing suit.
Well... hope she'll be very happy.
A real turd.
Congratulations on your daughter's wedding. Who's she marrying?
My pleasure, Al... Always happy to help out in a pinch...  Excuse me. I better call my service... tell them where I am.
Ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant.
That's more like it.
Give him the works.
Hey. I'm sorry. You want girls. I'll give you girls.
This is bad public relations. I was planning to do a lot of business with you. But now I'm going to have to go elsewhere.
Because I'm pissed off. Now give me your cash.
Why?
I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?
What are you...
That's it, prick lips.
Screw you!
They left an hour ago, pink nuts.
Your whores never showed up.
What are you talking about, asshole?
Jumbo, where the hell are the women?
Okay. Nice to meet you both.
They'll be up there in a half hour.
Park View Hotel, Room 1002.
Let's see your bread.
So we want your best girls, the cream of your crop.
This is cause for celebration. She'll probably charge half price for sex from now on.
Rick, I really think I'm in love.
Gary, how we doing, big stallion?
I didn't know you were into that.
Yes.
Hookers beat you up?
Screw that.
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
I'm going to see what the hell happened.
Guy paints a beautiful picture.
This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
It's true.
What's going on?
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.
Let's have a toast.
Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.
Because I love her. What can I tell you?
Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married?
All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
Okay... We're all here. Rick, what's the big announcement?
Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
Let's go.
Screw you...
Gary, you're quite an animal.
Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting.  Hi, guys.
Milt?
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
Sold. 45 minutes. No problem.
You are being in luck. Customers in same hotel. I let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
I need them for a bachelor party at the Park View Hotel.
Big problem now. Soon they go to customers.
I'll take some.
That I got. Very good women. They sit on your face, anything you want.
I want women.
I'm telling you I am, Joe.
You're a pimp?
What can I be doing for you?
Good.
That's it.
Is that all the coke in the place?
I don't want to talk about it. I love you guys. I love my friends.
Larry, you and your wife got problems?
I hate her. I hate her guts, the bitch.
Just in love with everybody. It's really a beautiful planet. I love you, Rick. I love you guys. I love everybody.
So, Larry, how have you been?
It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's peaceful...
It's my fault. He's dead because... I left those drugs...
It's Bullwinkle.
Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.
No, have fun first. Then laugh. Now, forget about marriage for a while. Go party.
Ha, ha, ha.
Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
I couldn't find any razor blades.
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
I'm trying to slash my wrists.
What the hell are you doing?
Yeah. I see you're right. C'mon, let's party.
Really?
Yeah, I guess so.
You okay?
No, she hates me... I want to end everything here... now.
Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
All right. Now, there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator. Go to bed right after "Falcon Crest."
I just want to be alone.
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
Guys, I think I'd rather stay here.
What do you mean, it changes?
She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
My marriage is the worst. All crap. A big pile of shit.
Right.
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
You want to share it?
Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid!
You're all under arrest. Open up!
I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job.
Keep your voices down. This is a respectable establishment. We don't go for any funny business here. Just then a GUY with a Moosehead Beer hat and TWO GUYS in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys.
What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later.
It's on the tenth floor.
Yes, you. We're looking for our room... 1002.
This is the Park View Hotel. I'm the Hotel Manager. Are you looking for someone?
Are any of those right?
Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.
Ebbie. Ger... umph... lable...
No sob story is going to change my mind.
The end.
Oh, no!
Rick!
Welcome, welcome, one and all.
First, you're a slob. You have to dress for success. Second, your outlook on life...
Feel free.
Let me finish. Debbie's an adult. She can do what she wants. But if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. If I may make some suggestions...
Mr. Thomerson, I...
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
I'd love that.
Rick, I want to cut through the b.s.
Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.
Can't I just maim it a little?
Rick, hit the ball easier, son. You don't have to kill it.
All right, who serves?
Oops!
It's all right...  So have I.
No, Brett, I...
You've been having strange sex...!
The phone made me do it!
Ed... you're kinky!
You can tell a man by his friends.
The thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
In a second...  And you're irresponsible. Show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.
Girls, why don't we go inside for lunch.  Boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?
No. Let's at least finish the set.
Er... perhaps we ought to stop now.
Of course.
I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons?
Then there is a God. Why don't we take that baby picture.
I'm separated.
Mrs.?
Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?
You got it.
I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.
What's with her costume?
My Debbie?
Debbie.
Who?
Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.
I'm saved. Let's party!
Reach out and snort someone.
I'll stop him... You stall him.
What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.
What are you going to do about it?
And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree...
How about this, a Trojan donkey.
Who's your friend?
Hey, you guys...
Take care.
Now, don't get into any trouble.
C'mon. Get the hookers in a circle. We better put Cochise out of business.
Very.
He look familiar?
Still drawing a blank.
How 'bout this?
Got me.
What's this?
I don't know.
Who was that?
I'm proud of you, lad.
Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
How'd it go?
That's the old Rick!
If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
Right in there, pal.
Oooooo.
I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
About what?
Rick, I'm concerned.
I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure.
I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now?
So long, Father.
I think you'll enjoy this table.
The best table in the house.
Under the table!
My gift to you.
What the hell is that?
C'mon. I insist.
I'm not really hungry.
Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.
Don't you love it when old friends stop by?
This isn't right.
Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican.
Then it's on to the real thing.
Olivier's in that, right?
We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...
Nothing... Let's get crazy!
What's the matter?
Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.
Where the hell is he?
She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.
Where'd she go?
Great.  I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
Oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. We're bringing them to the party.
Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of help.
Well, the first month it's great. The second month things calm down a little. By the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
Thanks a lot, that was the best. You're next.
Right. Give me the will to live. Let me go first.
Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break.
Okay, Rick, all finished. I can't wait for that bachelor party... I need the action.
That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.
Stan, you're depressing me... Hey, I didn't know you were going to fill 'er up. Just take a couple of gallons, okay?
You won't miss a thing about being single... The wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... God, I miss that.
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
Rick, marriage will be good for you. It's done wonders for me.
You always were sneaky, Stan, very sneaky.
Right... Think it over.
Get going, Rick... you're late enough as it is.
Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book.
You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.
There can be no excuse for tardiness.
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
You're late again, Rick.
Yeah. Who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
Can you believe how perfect it fits?
I'd love to get you in an operating room. Just once.
Maybe I did... I don't remember.
What? I thought you told me you had it all figured out.
I don't know.
How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.
Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
That is none of your business.
Where are you bound for?
Good morning.
Good day to you, young sir.
Don't bully, Mr. Best.  Here are the pistols.  God bless you, my boy; and when I count three, fire.
Ten, sir, and make them short ones, do you hear, Captain Grogan?
There's nothing else for it.  Take your ground, Grogan -- twelve paces, I suppose?
You know the use of arms very well, Best, and no one can doubt your courage; but Michael and I will see you home for all that.
I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.
Both of us ride home with Best here.
If you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, Best.
And, I'll tell you what, Mr. Dugan, I've been insulted grossly in this house.  I ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. I'm an Englishman, I am, and a man of property; and I -- I --
I never was more in earnest.
Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.
Hoity-toity!  John Best, what's the matter here?
Oh!  That will be sent after him.  I have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers, you say; and at noon, after parade, shall be at the inn.  You will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair, and will wait for me at the Chevalier's rooms until my arrival.  We must force that box.  You are a clumsy hound, or you would have got the key long ago.
And his baggage?
You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner.  When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.
Not yet, but I believe he intends to.
Has he sent the challenge yet?
I am not sure.  The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it.
What are the Chevalier's intentions?
I had thought you more expert.  You must find out if the Chevalier cheats.  He sees the English and Austrian envoys continually, and the young men of either ministry sup repeatedly at his house.  Find out what they talk of, for how much each plays, especially if any of them play on parole.  If you are able to, read his private letters, though about those which go to the post, you need not trouble yourself -- we look at them there.  But never see him write a note without finding out to whom it goes, and by what channel or messenger.  He sleeps with the keys of his dispatch-box with a string around his neck -- twenty frederics, if you get an impression of the keys.
Only a very little, as soldiers do.
You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well?
There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur.  He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet.
What is the service, sir?
Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.
The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion.
How do you do, sir?
Good morning, Private James.  Please come in.  I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.
Neither!
It's a lie!  You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know.  Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?
Sir, I'm a British officer.
I have acted as I think fit.
Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly.
It was my joke.  I was tired, and did not care to go farther.  There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile.
Where's the beauty you promised me?
The people are great farmers, as well as inn-keepers.
The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
Ah!  You sly rogue, I see that will influence you.
Do you want to see the loveliest woman in Europe?
This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland.  Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.
This is a very good inn.  Shall we stop for dinner?
Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady...
O'Grady.
What is your uncle's name?
My companion treated me with great civility, and asked me a thousand questions about England, which I answered as best I might.  But this best, I am bound to say, was bad enough.  I knew nothing about England, and I invented a thousand stories which I told him; described the king and the ministers to him, said the British ambassador in Berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him.
He has paid off your uncle's mortgage.  He gave Dorothy a coach- and-six.  That coward of a fellow has been making of your uncle's family.  Faith, the business was well done.  Your cousins, Michael and Harry, never let him out of their sight, though he was for deserting to England, until the marriage was completed, and the happy couple off on their road to Dublin.  Are you in want of cash, my boy?  You may draw upon me, for I got a couple of hundred out of Master Best for my share and, while they last, you shall never want.
The coward!
No, the very same one, my boy.  He recovered from his wound.  The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him.  It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family?  The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you.  But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.
Mrs. John Best!  Was there another Mr. John Best?!
She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband.  She is now Mrs. John Best.
Good heavens!  Whatever?  Has she died of grief?
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
Is Miss Dugan well?
I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown.
We must write to her today, and you can tell her that you are safe and married to "Brown Bess."
I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.
I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family.
A man of honor dies, but never apologizes.  I'll see the captain hanged before I apologize.
Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  You are but a boy.  Best is willing to consider you as such.  Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service.  Make Best an apology, and be off.
It must have been some other gate.
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame.  He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.
I'll match any man with the sword.
Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.
I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body.
I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.
And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck.  He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly.  But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.
That's a very handsome sword you have there.
Your cousins go out with him.
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
The meeting is arranged.  Captain Best is waiting for you now.
Have you taken my message to him?
In faith, I believe you are not; for a lad I never saw more game in my life.  Give me a kiss, my dear boy. You're after my own soul.  As long as Jack Grogan lives, you shall never want a friend or a second.
He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.
Well, if it must be, it must.  For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw.  No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.
Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan.  I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine.  Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?
And this is the return you make for his kindness!  Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
And so I am.
A pretty day's work of it you have made, Master Roderick.  Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family?  Best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past, and missing them all, and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father.
Faith, I think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word.
Dorothy might love me or not, as she likes, but Best will have to fight me before he marries her!
The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?
This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.
Tut, tut!  I can play at fencing as well as you, Mr. Roderick James. Ah!  You change color, do you?  Your secret is known, is it?  You come like a viper into the bosom of innocent families; you represent yourself as the heir to my friends the O'Higgins of Castle O'Higgins; I introduce you to the nobility and gentry of this methropolis; I take you to my tradesmen, who give you credit.  I accept your note for near two hundred pounds, and what do I find?  A fraud.
Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!
Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!
Whom have I been harboring in my house?  Who are you, sirrah?
I have heard of them.
Ah -- I see.  No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.
Oh, I am thinking of the O'Higgins of Redmondstown.  General O'Higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, Colonel Granby Somerset.
Which O'Higgins do you know?  For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.
Mr. O'Higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in Dublin.  Mister O'Higgins, I wonder if I know your good father?
I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.
Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife.
I have said all there is to be said. I am at your disposal for whatever purposes you wish.  Good night.
Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.
Chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. If you will be patient, maybe I will pay you something another time.
Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which I have honorably won.
I don't know.
I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.
The gentleman has nothing contraband.
I have no luggage.
As you please.
All Europe shall hear of this!
Your honor must lower his voice.
Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not.
It is shameful -- infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house.
You are going to drive to the frontier.
Good gracious!  What is this?
I will let down the steps for your honor.
Where is my rascal, Lazlo?
Perfectly certain, because I shall make him tremble.
Certain?
I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.
To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman.
Sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand, we will meet you.
When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins, and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags, what did we ask?
Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.
Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?
But how, sir?
Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.
But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?
I have faced that problem before.
I believe they will deport you.
Have no fear.  It will come out well for me.
But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.
We will practice in the mornings, my boy, and I'll put you up to a thing or two worth knowing.
I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.
The cards are now my only livelihood.  Sometimes I am in luck, and then I lay out my money in these trinkets you see.  It's property, look you, and the only way I have found of keeping a little about me. When the luck goes against me, why, my dear, my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and I wear paste.  Do you understand the cards?
I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.
And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.
Only the agency of servants.
Who else can give me information about you?
No one, sir.  Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.
For whom else have you worked?
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
Yes, sir.
Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?
Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.
You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?
Take to your legs, low Irish dog.
That is a trifle strong.
Very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.
On the instant.  Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
Then you yield to me.
Very well!  Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.
Perfectly so; and what is more, I will tell you that I love her, and that I am not of a humor to put up with rivals.
Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady.
Old fool!
Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.
Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you.  I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty.  What sacrifice do you want from me?  I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me.
My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one.  Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me.  We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes.  One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth.  She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me:
We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that, from time to time, her ladyship cried out:  "Oh, my God.  Is it true -- I am not dreaming?"
As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.
Without you, my dearest, I might have died without ever knowing love. Inexpressible love!  God of nature! Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter, sweetness than which nothing is more bitter.  Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes.
O, my dearest love.  Enough!  I beg you.  Stop believing in your experience.  You have never known love.  My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours!
Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it.
Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is dying, and yet I envy him more than any man in Christendom.  He enjoys a privilege of which I am deprived. He may take you in his arms whenever he pleases, and no veil keeps his senses, his eyes, his soul from enjoying your beauty.
My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.
Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.
I know better than you do.  Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.
Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.
Will we always leave it at this?
I ask only a payment on account today -- after that, you will find me undemanding, obedient and discreet.
Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?
With a woman who is completely charming, be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition, and who, regardless of her rank, will show me some kindness, tonight.
Be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are?
But you deceive me nonetheless if I believe you, for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer.
Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.
The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.
To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
To make me wretched in two weeks.
It is my only object.
You want my heart?
By loving you, with no hope of possessing you.
How so?
I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.
A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.
It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.
That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.
It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.
Then you have never loved?  Your heart is empty.
Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.
What!  You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
Have you not a man whom you value?
Not one.
How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
Not even that.
But, for a time... a passing fancy?
Never.
Have you had one?
No.
Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.
Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?
Jump twenty feet!  You wouldn't dare to do any such thing on Daisy. There's the captain's horse, Black George, I've heard say that Captain Bes --
Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side.
But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London.  It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter.
If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two.  I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
Oh!  I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner.  Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.
But you refused me, Dorothy.
I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do! And I only danced with her because -- because -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.
With pleasure at finding the ribbon.
Why are you shaking?
Then you must get it.
I feel the ribbon.
Do you see the gate at the end of the field?  The first to touch it will be the winner.
Agreed.
I accept, but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases.
All right, five hundred guineas.
Last month, the Duke of Suffolk spent no more.
It is entirely up to you.  I want the best.
All the same, you must name an amount.
Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
As much as possible?
As much as possible.
I am at your service, Mr. Cosgrove. How much do you wish to spend?
Well, Mr. Cosgrove, I'll answer you point by point.  The King is exceedingly averse to make peers, as you know.  Your claim, as you call them, have been laid before him, and His Majesty's gracious reply was, that you were the most impudent man in his dominions, and merited a halter, rather than a coronet.  As for withdrawing your support from us, you are perfectly welcome to carry yourself whithersoever you please.  And, now, as I have a great deal of occupation, perhaps you will do me the favor to retire, or tell me if there is anything else in the world in which I can oblige you.
Yes!
Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?
Well, sir, this nobleman is one of the gentlemen of His Majesty's closet, and one with whom our revered monarch is on terms of considerable intimacy.  I should say you would be wise to fix upon this nobleman your chief reliance for the advancement of your claim to the Viscounty which you propose to get.
By name only.
Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?
And, to be sure, I did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done, and this was the distinguished solicitor and former Government Minister, Lord West, whose acquaintance I made, as I had so many others, at the gaming table.
What is to be done?
Then this must be done tomorrow.
When is he to go?
The King has determined to send the Chevalier out of the country.
The Prince left him only that choice.
A meeting with the Prince of Turbingen is impossible.
Hmm-mmmm.
In so far as I can tell these things -- no.  I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.
Was he cheated?
Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein.
Does this assignment interest you?
You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver.
How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies.  In every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality.  To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum.
That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins.
As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?
O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.
But I shouldn't like to put you to such trouble, Mister...?
I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.
That fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me.
Everything -- my purse, containing upwards of a hundred guineas, my jewels, my snuff-boxes, watches. And all because this blundering coward fell to his knees...
Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong.  Have you lost much?
Oh, I am grateful to you, sir.  I am the wife of Captain O'Reilly hastening to join him at Dublin.  My chair was stopped by a highwayman; this great oaf of a servant-man fell down on his knees, armed as he was, and though there were thirty people in the next field, working, when the ruffian attacked, not one of them would help but, on the contrary, wished him "good luck."
What has happened, madam, to annoy your ladyship?
When I asked them in what form they would accept her ladyship's assurances, they said that they were only prepared to accept them if her ladyship confirms her written consent by word of mouth, in their presence, at their counting-house in Birchin Lane, London.  I requested they come here, and save her ladyship and yourself the inconvenience of the trip to London, but they declined, saying that they did not wish to incur the risk of a visit to Castle Hackton to negotiate, as they were aware of how other respectable parties, such as Messrs. Sharp and Salomon had been treated here.
I see.
Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.
Yes, of course.
May I be quite frank with you?
Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?
There are a few other points we should discuss.  The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.
I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.
Considering your financial circumstances, Mr. Cosgrove, it has been impossible to find anyone at all prepared to do any business with you.  I think you may count yourself lucky to have this opportunity. But, obviously, if you would reject this offer, I shall keep trying to find a better one.
Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18% a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
I have good news for you, Mr. Cosgrove.  The firm of Bracegirdle and Chatwick, in the city of London, are prepared to lend you 20,000 pounds, pledged against your interest in the Edric mines.  They will redeem the encumbrances against the property, which amount to some 10,000 pounds, and take a twenty- year working lease on the mines. They will lend you the 20,000 pounds against the lease income, which they will apply to the loan as it comes in, and they will make a charge of 18% per annum interest on the outstanding loan balance.
Brooksy was better than you, papa, he used not to swear so, and he taught me many good things while you were away.
Yes, he's fine.
Is he all right, papa?
Your bother is in America fighting the rebels.
Yes, papa.
I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him.
What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad this story?
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?
Yes?
Papa?
Good night, my little darling.
Good night, papa.
Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
Now, just have a little patience, my boy.  Your birthday isn't until next week.
Did you buy the horse, papa?
I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet?
Sir, let those laugh that win.
Not so soon, my dear, as you may fancy perhaps.  Why, man, I have been given over many times these four years, and there was always a candidate or two waiting to apply for the situation.  Who knows how long I may keep you waiting.
I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.  I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if I win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?
He wants to step into my shoes!  He wants to step into my shoes!
Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?
Gentlemen, see this amiable youth! He has been troubled by religious scruples, and has flown for refuge to my chaplin, Mr. Hunt, who has asked for advise from my wife, Lady Cosgrove, and between them both, they are confirming my ingenious young friend in his faith.  Did you ever hear of such doctors and such a disciple?
I think, Sir William Cosgrove, you have had too much drink.  Your chaplin, Mr. Hunt, has introduced me into the company of your lady to advise me on a religious matter, of which she is a considerable expert.
Come, come, sir.  I am a man who would rather be known as a cuckold than a fool.
I beg your pardon?
Good evening, Mr. James, have you done with my lady?
Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches.  He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years.  If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady?  But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account.
Well, why not a milkmaid's daughter? No man of sense need restrict himself or deny himself a single amusement for his wife's sake; on the contrary, if he selects the animal properly, he will choose such a one as shall be no bar to his pleasure, but a comfort in his hours of annoyance.  For instance, I have got the gout; who tends me?  A hired valet who robs me whenever he has the power.  My wife never comes near me.  What friend have I?  None in the wide world.  Men of the world, as you and I are, don't make friends, and we are fools for our pains.
The milkmaid's daughter?
In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
Would you have me spend my life all alone?
Indeed, you are right, sir.  Look at me.  Marriage has added forty years to my life.  I am dying, a worn-out cripple, at the age of fifty.  When I took off Lady Cosgrove, there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself.  Fool that I was! I had enough with my pensions, perfect freedom, the best society in Europe -- and I gave up all these, and married and was miserable.  Take a warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and stick to the trumps.  Do anything, but marry.
Hang it, Mr. Roderick James, you have no more manners than a barber, and I think my black footman has been better educated than you; but you are a young fellow of originality and pluck, and I like you, sir.  because you seem determined to go to the devil by a way of your own.
I made Sir William Cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play- table.  One could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime; for, though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases, a cripple wheeled about in a chair, and suffering pangs of agony, yet you would see him every morning, and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth.
Tender Hegenheim.
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
Will he wish to know the details of this night?
He loves me, as I love you.
If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.
He is only curious to know who you are.
And he doesn't care about me?
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
Dark Valdez.
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
Charming Schuvaloff.
The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever.
The sets were good.
Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
Yeah it was okay.
I paid for those guitar cases.
Those aren't presents. That's normal friendship stuff
When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. Who paid? When we went to see 'Cats'. Who paid?
Such as?
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
I got you those trousers from Paul Smith.
No I don't.
You know what for.
What for?
Put it in the cases. Split it up. And don't forget you owe me 150.
Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
You first.
No I haven't.
You have. You've actually fallen for this prick.
Leave him!
What. You're what? You're with this creep now.
What are you doing here?
What? What are you doing?
Name it.
A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby?
You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
What?
Thank you.
Say thank you.
Yeah.
Do you like it?
It is. I did it cooking.
That's not a burn.
It's nothing. I burnt myself.
What's this?
We'll stop then.
Yes.
Do you want to stop?
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
What do you mean?
It's enough isn't it?
There's over eighty thousand here.
Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.
Right.
I thought you could give us the tour this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.
Hello.
Uh... Yes.
You can see why it's sensitive?
Right.
To customers approaching the bank from the rear
Ch...
This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely car. Doesn't necessarily give the right impression.
Leave her alone.
I'm so sorry.
Just leave her alone.
Oh Jesus. Of course I can't.
He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
Oh Jesus.
I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh Jesus.
You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
He wants the money from your bank.
I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
He wants a lot of money.
Tell him to put the kettle down and I'll give him money.
He wants money.
What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?
He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
What did he say? Tell me!
What? What does he want?
He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. John, he is a soldier. A trained killer. We must do what he says.
Put the fucking kettle down. Tell, Yuri, tell him put it down or I'm going to make him.
John.
Put the fucking kettle down.
Good night.
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
You can stay tonight.
I understand. I'm so sorry
To be indoors on such a day. It's crime.
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
How is bank?
It's very strange. How many people are truly themselves with their love? It is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers. There are no Marches Against Heartache, no Ministries Against Loneliness, no Concerts Against Disappointment. We look away. And still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us. The one thing we all share but don't say. Look John I will show you something.
I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
Do you believe in love?
No. It's not that.
You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love.
He says why did you send to Russia for a wife.
Tell me what he said.
No. It is too judgmental.
Tell me.
Oh nothing.
What was that?
Binoculars. He had these Binoculars he has kept from the war.
Binoculars.
"I have these uh..." She explains to you... "When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses." Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds.
I...
"I saw you waiting there, by the gate."
When?
What?
She says she has a secret to tell.
Classic!  Thank God. She says 'Yes!'
Uh. Do you like England?
She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John!
No, no...
You're asking for my documents?
You must have a visa or something...
Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
So how long will you be in England?
Yes it's okay. Thank you for the food.
I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.
What was that?
So I come to England with other actors to make shows, I meet this freak from Novgorod I tell him of you and Chicken and the birthday here we are.
So?
Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
No.
I am actor, he is actor, although he is an actor stroke musician. I just noodle along, I'm not so good. He makes me look like a retard -- He smokes me. I don't mean he smokes me.
Right.
We better watch him. He's crazy.
Right.
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?
Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us.
Hold on.
And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not. But we say cousin. This is for you.
And...
Good. 
Yes. I know.
Oh.  We are Russian.
I need to know who you are first please.
He says he feels safe here.
What did he say?
What?
I'm asking what you're here for.
Sorry. You've lost me...
What are you doing here?
You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.
My name's Sophia.
Right.
Hurry. I'll wait for you here.
Maybe you will find out.
What does it mean?
Tell me about it.
It's a long way to go for a date.
It's more like a date.
No. What? No. I know.
I'm not asking you to marry me.
Why?
It's what you came back for.
It's not mine either.
It's not mine.
Please.
I'm sorry.
Whatever.
You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.
Goodbye.
I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.
You can probably buy them on the flight.
Okay. Promise?
Something else.
Goodbye.
Okay. Goodbye.
Because it was a lie.
Please. Why not?
Yeah. No thanks.
Whatever.
Okay. Thank you.
No. I think I better just go.
I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
It's alright.
You know you can come under the blanket.
What's your name?
What was her name?
I don't know.
Except for Small Eyes.
Except for Small Eyes.
I don't want anyone to die.
Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
Nobody's that unhappy.
I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
I've got news for you. It's not working.
I'm trying to quit.
You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog.
Laugh it up.
She's alive!! She is not dead?
She's alive?
I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
What?
I don't know why I said that. She's not dead at all.
I'm sorry.
She's dead.
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
What?
What happened between you and the blonde?
Not really. Maybe a little.
Are you scared?
No.
Have you had any before?
No.
Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
Well what have you got?
I don't have nothing.
I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing.
You are pretty naive if you think it is.
Thank Christ for that.
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
Then okay.  So how old were you when you met him?
I wasn't saying anything.
Please, there's no... Oh.
What? I... I wasn't saying...
You don't have to say anything
You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world.
Get out.
You are throwing me out.
Get out
Excuse me?
You don't understand you either.
You don't understand me.
So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?
It wasn't what I wanted.
You didn't mind too much.
I got what I paid for.
You...
What?
Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
So now you hate all women?
Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
Why?
I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.
Some... What does that mean?
Sometimes neither.
Sometimes which?
Sometimes.
So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?
Listen. I didn't go rooting around in your private stuff.
Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.
So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
And who says what is wrong.
And. It's wrong.
And? What are you saying?
Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
I don't hate you.
So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
We'll pretend it never happened.
Okay we won't talk about it.
No.
You don't want to talk about it.
Shut up. I'm not listening.
Why not?
I don't want to talk about it.
No. But you tend to tie them up.
Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.
Excuse me?
He will come back.
Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed.
But, you know, so what?
Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
Oh Jesus.
Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
So uh...
Fine. Absolutely. Must be disappointing though. Must come as a hell of a shock.
It's none of your business.
Fine.
I don't want to talk about him.
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
I said I don't have any.
What?
I don't have any money.
Give me some money.
Yes.
Shut up. Have you got your passport?
What?
Have you got your passport?
You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.
No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
What? No you're not..
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
What?
Where's the restroom?
Well, Nadia, It it's all the same to you, I'd like to give it a bash.
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
In every sense. If at all possible.
So you're just going to be vindictive
I do. I want to very badly.
I know you just want to punish me --
In the world.
No I don't.
You must think... I'm the biggest pillock... In the world.
Well as it turns out I did.
Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.
They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.
I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
So what are you going to do?
That's a relief. It's nice to know I'm a regular guy.
It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
I don't want to know.
It's makes it easier. Okay.
Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.
I think that about covers it. I think I have grasped the part about you being dumped though. That's got to hurt, I imagine. That's got to smart a bit. I mean strictly in my observer's capacity it seemed you two were getting on Pretty Fucking Famously.
You don't understand anything.
Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.
They go.
Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
They go.
What's wrong?
They go. John. They go.
Yes I know.
"Frenzy".
Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday.
Syevodnya
Syevodnya?
Happy bath day.
I don't understand.
Sorry?
Today is bath day.
Yes.
Uh... Are you a giraffe?
Yes.
Do you follow or should I speak slower?
Yes.
Good. Or should I speak slower?
Yes.
Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?
Yes.
And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you?
Yes.
I bet.  What about me? Am I how you imagined?
Yes.
So. Is it different to how you imagined it?
I mean... "Ants." "I've got a problem with ants."
Yes.
I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
Yes.
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
Yes.
It's about forty miles from here. I don't know if you've looked at a map, it's close to London but it's a city in itself. A Roman city. It's a nice house. I'm having a problem with ants. I uh... It's the warmer weather. I can't seem to find the nest. Sorry, do you understand "ants"?
Right. Okay. Good.
Yes.
Is that everything?
Cash.
How do you want to pay?
Thanks.
You have excellent English.
Please check. Is it full? Please could you check.
I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
Is the flight full?
Sure.
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
Your mom was a dancer?
No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
You're kidding!
Really?
We work on Rodeo Drive.  But we're both professional dancers.
He's really funny!
I'm Adam Webber.
This is my new friend...
Thank-Q!
Bravo!
You like it?
Oh, now, that's a great one!
I was wondering if you might help me. I...I seem to have lost my Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere around here.
Yes?
Hi!
Young man, stop right there!
The key to my hotel room!  I want you to have my baseball cards!  And please be sure to pay my bill!
Yes, ma'am.
Let's go talk first, Adam.
I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.
Well, that depends...
For how long?
My office.
Come where?
We want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences.
Adam, I'd like to introduce you to my associate -- Mr. Brown.
Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
Very well, thank you. I'm with the County Family Services Department. Eve tells me you've been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
How do you do?
I'm Nina Aron, Adam.
Eve? I'm leaving.
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
Maybe we shouldn't fight at all. Fighting is pretty immature.
Do ya?
Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself.
Shallow? I'm shallow?!
I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.  Well, isn't he?  And shallow, as well?
What?!
Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?
Oh, brother...
Please excuse this interruption.
How 'bout a drink at the bar?
Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
But I do miss that green sport coat of yours.
I do fine, Adam.  How 'bout yourself?  You doin' any good?
How do you do?
My mother's like that.
We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?
No.
Could I please just go home?  I was lost, but this morning I found home and I promise not to bother any of you ever again.
...I do.
...All right, Eve.  If you say so.
Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing.  The best thing for you. I promise.
Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....
Hi, Eve!
Neat. Goodnight!
And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
Really?  Okay!
It was at least as good as the sky.
My pleasure.
Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?
Of course.  I shouldn't be over here at this hour.
I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.
Yes, Eve?
Uh-huh. Adam?
No.
Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?
"All at once am I--several stories high-- knowing I'm--on the street-- where you live."  It's about a young man who is overjoyed just to be standing in front of the house of the person he loves.
Sing it to me.
But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi.  But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live."  You know it?
Is that what you call it?
I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable.
Thanks.
There.
Well, you had better!!
I know first aid!
Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
Eve, if you'll let me, I can --
Goodnight!
What?
Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
I know...and I'm really sorry.
What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
I'm really sorry!
Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!
Eve?!
And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you out--because I quit!  This is ridiculous! You're ridiculous! I'm ridiculous!
But, Eve, I would--
I'm leaving, too.
Eve, I'm sorry.
I don't blame you!
I'm sorry.
Adam?!
All right. Let me tell you the whole thing. In 1962--
I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--
You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied.
Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
You wanted to see me!
Did you?
Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
What?
Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be.
Okay. All right.  And what do I say?
Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.
Maybe. But that's how it works.
That's ridiculous.
Yes, really! Basically, they want what they think they can't have.  Same with guys.  That's why everybody is walking around here sending off "you can't have me" signals!
Really?
What do I say to Miss Sweet when I meet her?
Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
Okay. I like that.
How 'bout this one?
Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.
Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
No way.
What about her?
It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink, I'm told.
What have you ordered?
And don't be so obvious!
I like her.
Not that one!
I thought I was here to meet women.
Good-bye!
Quit showing off!  We're here on business!
Yes!
Do I look crazy?
No!  Not crazy!
Look unimpressed.
My goodness gracious!  This place is something!
Well...yeah. Okay.
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
No it's not!
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
I certainly do!
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
Hey, Eve!
Okay!
He's going to kill himself.  Go skate out on the bike path! It's that way!
It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair!
What about holding your right arm up like that all the time?
Whatever you two want. If you've got the time, I've got the wazoo.
Yeah.
About clothing?
That's boring!
The guy with the underpants!
Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?
The what?
So, what are you seeing?
All right.
Uh...yeah.
May I please be excused?
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
In the house?
Sure.
He has a computer?
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
Where's he gone?
Good for you.
Yeah, right!  That's where you'd go to find girls!  Nome.  He's gay, by the way.
Wow.
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
Yes!
I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?
Um-hum.
Okay, let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay?
Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
I thought only hookers drank those things.
Thank-Q!
Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.
What?!
Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.
He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?
Why, thank you!  Very nice to have met you, Cliff!  May I ask you a question?
I like it.
Yes!
Is this your house?
I was wrong!!
You said it would be easy!
Never drive again!
I told you I've never driven before!
You almost got us killed!
Sorry!
Stop that ma'am crap!
Yes, ma'am!
Now, get out!!
The engine is still running.
Get out!
Thank you.
Of course.
Could we talk about that a little later?
That's what I was afraid of.
Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.
Two weeks.
When do you need her by?
And if possible, I'd like to marry someone from Pasadena.
No dogs, huh? Okay.
One who's not a mutant.
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
It didn't used to be that way.
Everybody's divorced.
They're all divorced?
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
I didn't know that.
Sure.
It does?
The big one!
Bites what?
You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
I don't want to be alone.
Why?!
Because I want to get married.
What for?
Yes.
A wife?
Well... Okay. I would like you to help me find a...wife.
Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.
This is for me.
No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
Then forget it.
Oh, I'm sure it will!
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
Name it.
There's something else I would like you to help me with.
Now, let's take the truck back and get something to eat.
Okay.
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
Thank you.
You know, Eve -- don't get mad, okay? - -  but, I'd just be lost without you.
No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
I guess we'll need another locker.
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.
Night!
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.
Sorry.
Well, another day, another dollar.  Stop staring at me!!
What?
Wait! Wait!
Hey!  Pipe tobacco!  I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!
Very funny, smart ass.
My Mom and Dad.
Who are these people?
They like Dr. Pepper.
Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr. Pepper?
Sure.
You got it! Wait here while I change.
I've got to make at least a thousand a week.
What's fair?
What's the pay?
Two weeks.
How long would you need me?
Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.
Food and supplies?  Who for?  Like starving people?
Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
Doing what?
Why not go to work for me?
It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
...Okay.
Why?!  Who the hell knows?!
Why does it never work out?  You and...men?
What?
Why doesn't it never work out?
See, ya.
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
Watching television in color.
The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
I think it's the eyes.
Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
Thank-Q!
No.
Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend?
Okay!  Damn!
Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!
Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.
Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your visit.
I haven't brushed yet.
Why are you doing that?
Okay.
Take it. damn it!
I can't, it's yours.
Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it.
I am so glad to see you!!  I thought I'd never see you again!
Right.
Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.
That was...wonderful!  I've never felt anything like that in my life.
I can't help it. Perry Como always does this to me! I just get so cranked!
Gee-zooie!!  You better slow down!!!
I know a short-cut.
Hey, what are you doing?!
You are one scary son-of-a-gun.
Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
Over this?
Oh, I could die...
How's that?
Okay, okay!  Take it easy!
Perry Como!  You had him!  Go back! Go back!
Perry?
It's Perry!
What is it?!
Wait!  Wait!
Mind if I change the station? Better traffic reports on AM.
It's Webber.  Adam Webber.
So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?
Okay.  What the hell?  You got a deal. Get in.
Heck, no!  What?!
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
Yes.
And that's it?
Yes.
So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do is drive you to your hotel?
So what?!  I've got two of him!  And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons. I was holding these out, too.
Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!
He's all yours. I was holding him back.
Rogers Hornsby?!?
Wait! Please wait!  I'll make a deal with you!  I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel!
Get away from me!!
I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me!
Well, that changes everything. Get the fuck away from me!!  I mean it!!
Nope.
You don't?
If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.
I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.
Do you own a car?
Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
It was amazing.
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
Again.
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
Right.
Yes, I'm right?
So far?
Let me guess something. This is your first visit to La La Land. You're staying somewhere over in Hollywood because, like an idiot, you thought that would be an exciting place to stay.  Right so far?
Oh, that's nice.
Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.
I don't know. Why doesn't it?
Why doesn't that surprise me?
I came on a bus.
Here, pick these up!
I just had a mental picture of...
What's wrong with you?
A walking penis capable of intelligent speech.  A dickhead.
Dickhead?
Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
You're lost?
No, I'm lost.
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
Where are we going?
Yes, ma'am.  But my name is Adam.
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
No, you get out of here.
Get out of here!
Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.
No.  I'm from out of town.  I'm here on business.
Are you French?
Bon soir, mademoiselle!
Of course!
Yes, sir.
A card?
Fill this out please. And I'll need a card.
Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel.
Nothing.
What?
Is this because of the radiation?
Gee-ma-nee!
Yes, it is.
Is that a birthday cake?!
Archbishop Melker. We met earlier.
I've got almost everything we need! And this nice man...
I promise.
The front door is open.  Will you be back?
How do I leave here?
No. I don't need money anymore -- I see that now.
That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it.
Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
I've got to go, now.
Yes.
I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?
Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!
All in yellow?  Oh!  That was my father!
Yes!  Yes!  Oh, Lord!  Yes, oh, yes! But  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!
Are you all right?
Hah!!! Those cagey rascals! Those sly dissemblers! Those, uh...  They've finally pulled the wool over everybody's eyes!
Uh, I think they have.
My gosh, those Commies are brilliant! You've got to hand it to 'em!  "No, we didn't drop any bombs!  Oh yes, our evil empire has collapsed!  Poor, poor us!"  I bet they've even asked the West for aid!  Right?!
Uh-huh.
Yes. That's kind of how it was.
What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?"
Yes, sir. It's true.
That's what everybody believes?
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
You're sure?
Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
Uh-huh.
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it?
Well, in that case...of course, son.
And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
But, I don't understand.
I'll try.
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
I promise. Is that all?
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
Adult Bookstore.  Why?
Also...stay out of the "Adult Bookstore."
Yes, sir.  Is that all?
...the pipe tobacco.
Yes, father?! Yes?
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
Merci!
C'est bon, Monsieur.
Shit is a French word?
Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have been down here a little too long!  Please excuse her French.
No, son! We wait for night.  Now...is precisely when... we must be at our... most cautious.
Well, do we just go on up?!
These are really swell! I mean swell!
Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!
No kidding!
Your mom made that all by herself.
Oh, boy! A jacket!
Blow out the candles!
Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!
Because he must!
Then why go there?
Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!
Why?
No, no! The runner on second goes to third! He's out there!
No. Sit down.
The nocturnal flying mammal?
Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
Like one of Mom's?
No, son. A pitcher.
Like a painting?
It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
What's baseball?
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
These are wonderful.
You know, you have a wonderful sense of humor, son!  I must say, the acorn doesn't fall very far from the tree. By the way, it's time I gave you something. Come with me.
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
Gerade aus dann links!
En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roul!
Tempus fugit!
You're right!  It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!
Latin exam, Dad.  It's Tuesday.
Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.
They're pretty.  Can I have them?
This is what money looks like.  It comes like this, in coin, or like this in paper.  Or you can have an "investment."  These are stock "certificates" that we bought in your name.  Of course, they're worthless now, but at one time they were quite valuable.
What?
And thanks for always being happy!
Bye, Adam!
Bye, Troy!
Goodbye.
Good-bye, Adam.
Yeah...Seems to.
Does that work?
I know what you mean!  I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
What?
So, did you buy a movie?
You bet!
How 'bout we check with Eve first?
Okay, Troy!  Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!
No!  There's an Adult Bookstore back there!  I'll be right back!
I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in vain again, didn't I?  I'm so sorry.
Okay. Thank you, my friends.
Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool.
Ladies first, Troy! That was close.
What?!
Oh. I see.
Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
Why did you park way back there?
I LOVE THIS!!
That's why little things mean so much to him.
Amazing. I'm very impressed.
The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
The recovery is very impressive.
Almost all of them.
I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.
No.
Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that?
Okay.
I just don't want to.
Why not? He has great pants.
I'm not wearing his pants.
Not on him.
True.
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
Yes. He likes windows.
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
Yeah?
That would knock my father out.
Okay, maybe she is psychic.  Let's go eat!
Mt. McKinley.  It's also the highest point in North America.
How do you get through those winters?  Well, you're right.  Juneau.  What's the highest peak?
No.
You don't have a computer in your cabin?
I don't think so.
What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?
It's so small.
Yeah.
This must be very new.
Sorry, that's the largest city.
Hello! It's Anchorage!  Gotcha!
Juneau.
What's the capitol?
1867.  Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.
When did we get it from them?
Russia.
Who use to own it?
1959.
Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions.  When did Alaska become a state?
Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?
I've got goose-bumps all over me.
She's right?!
I've never met anyone like you in my life.
That's right?
Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town.
Right on the button.
Really?  Since when?
Maybe Eve can guess.  She's psychic.
And it's called...?
It's a very small place. People don't even know it's there.
You nut!
I love Lucy!
Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori" if you prefer. I love sushi.
Not particularly.
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
You have very nice ceilings.
Goodnight.
Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
I guess living up here makes people look older.
Twenty-five? Around there.
How old do I look?
You don't look thirty-five.
Thirty-five.
How old are you?
Good night!  Sleep tight.  Don't let the bedbugs bite!  That's what my Mom always says...  ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry.  It's my first night away from home.
No kiddin'. Well...good night.
My father is a genius.
Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.
I see.  Well, thank you very much. You've been very, very nice.
The hotel.
Of what?
You dial nine to get out.
Just look!!
I don't see anything!
Up there!!
The sky?  Where?
The sky!!!
What?  What is it?!
Gladly.
Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is!  Would you excuse me?
Sure.
You could have a meat order that big delivered to your home.
Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!
Frozen, they're six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.
Come on. Frozen. How much are they?
Yes, please.  I'm looking for all beef patties.
Help you?
Good!
I do alright.
How do you do, ma'am.
Say what?!
Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
Whatcha looking at?
Hey, smart ass, how 'bout I kick your butt?
I didn't want to leave without saying how much I admire your jewelry.
Oh, you got a problem with that?
Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.
Well, we're here to help!
Oh, that would be wonderful!
I see what ya mean. Tell you what...I'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller.  Ones, fives, tens. Like that.
Really? No kidding?
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
How--how much do you want for the Mickey Mantle, rookie season?
Hi.
Hello.
Yes.
No.
Eve and I...eloped.  We're married.
Well, where are you --
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
This is your bedroom?
No, wait! At least stay for dinner!
We have to go.
I can't explain it now.  But I want you to set the locks for two months. You have more than enough of everything.  Then we'll be back to get you.
What?
Mom?  Eve and I have to go.
A psychiatrist?!
I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
Are you in trouble, son?!
...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down.  But we've got to hurry.
Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
Yes, ma'am.
Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything.
Yes, ma'am.
Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. One who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from Pasadena. Nothing against Valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from Pasadena, I don't know...always just seemed a little nicer.
I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl.  I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so.
Yes?
Mom?
I just hope this is still good up there.
Right.
Yes, ma'am.
I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing.
You're my brave boy.
I'll be all right.
I'm afraid you've got to.
I'll go up.
He seems to be doing all right now.  I don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. But we  need supplies and I've got to stay with him.
Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom.
Dad!
You never know. You may someday dine at the White House with the president.
Sorry, Mom!
Elbows, Son.
Yes, ma'am.
Oh. A nice one, I hope.
Let's all remain calm. That's the key thing.
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
And now you must let me be the judge of that!
You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
Calm down, please. This man needs help and you need protection from him. That's obvious.
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
I have to. If a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
Oh, my God!
Yeah.
Good god.
Yeah.
He drank it hot?
The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
All back East.
What about relatives?
Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.
No, I can't.  I'm sorry!  I have to go!  I have to...
Uh-huh. And it's all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even throw in some free lawn furniture.
Really?
Cute Little Old Man, if you want a boy, I can be a boy.  And if you want a girl, I can be a girl.  I can be anything you want me to be!
Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  "Boy?"  Did you say you were a "country boy?"
"Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.
Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?
The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
So...you...survived the blast, did you?
Good.
What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!
You got a light, honey?
What can I offer you, Eve?
Some time.
Well, please excuse us!  We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um...
To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried about.
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
I thought ten years.
How long will you set it for this time?
Amen.
And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam.  Amen.
Yes, dear, I know.
He's smart.
--do as I say!
And the ocean!  A mountain range!
--and we will--
I want him to at least see the sky!
Well, I am the head of this household--
No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
We'll make do.  I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
For how long?  We've just about run out of everything!
Excuse me.
Yes.
We do?
We stay down here.
Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest.  I just can't.
I don't believe it!
Yes.
No.
Others are...multi-sexual.  It seems...they can be both masculine and feminine...simultaneously.
It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out of garbage cans.  Others are...cover your ears, Son, and hum.  I mean that literally and I mean right now!
Mutants?!
I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants.
Yes! That's right!
It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
Yes, yes it is!
Just open the door.
Should we say a little prayer first?
I know exactly what you mean!  Hey, honey?
Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
In the generator room again?
Sure.
Would you excuse me?
You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?
Yes...
If we still have one.
Yeah. Let's dig in!
Let's eat our cake.
Well, we'll be going up in two years. We'll know then. I'm very hopeful.
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
One who doesn't glow in the dark.
Well, we did in my family!
Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!
If he tells, it won't come true!
What did you wish for, Adam?
And I made these!
No kidding.  Who else would have done it?
You bet.
Get the presents and do the lights.
Coming!
Calvin!
Hi.
Hi, honey!
I believe there will be other survivors. In fact, I'm guessing there's life on the surface, even now. It's not life worth living perhaps, but believe me, something's moving around up there. And I don't just mean the cockroaches.
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be.
Nonsense. People have no idea what the human mind is capable of. Look at us!
Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.
Not bad for a three and a half year old! I'd like to see the public school system match that! I don't care how terrific it is!
What?
Watch this!
Yes.  Well... yes.
Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
No reason.  Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
Why?
Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
Right here!
Calvin?!
What? Whatever you want, Helen!
If I...you know...
Yes!
And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
No.  I think it's just right.
What shall we call him?
I've noticed.
No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
Is there a problem?
Honey?
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
What?
Oh, no.
I told you! I've got everything!
You have tranquilizers?
Would you like a tranquilizer?
No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!
How could you?! This is just like home!
Maybe I've just got the creeps.
Really?
No, Calvin, you're favorite.
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
I'm not hungry.
Burnt to a crisp.  I've given you the most well-done cut.
All our friends...
We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
No.
Hi, honey! Feeling better?
To go up.
To go up.
It's safe.
Then after that it's safe.
Thirty -five years!
To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.
The locks?
The locks.
What's that noise?
To you maybe.
Home sweet home!
As long as we've got that straight.
Yes, dear!
Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
Days??
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
How long will we have to stay down here?
Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio.
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates.
Yes.
You hear that?!
I never know anymore.
No.  They all do.
Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.
It shuts off automatically.
Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have--
It's time.
We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a coat?
I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!
You bet, hon!
Well, put it down and come in!
Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got guests!
I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
Stop it, you two!
Yeah. Before I kick your ass.
Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.
You know, I don't know.  And looking at you, I don't care.  It's been too long, Eve.
So where is your roommate, the model?
Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat!
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.
This is Adam.  Adam, meet Cliff.
Hey, they're Ralph Laurens.  And who's this interesting looking fellow?
You came back for these?
Your stuff?  Let me see that.
I forgot some of my stuff.
What are you doing here?
What are you bitching about now?
Stop!
Where?!
Adam!!
Yeah.  Maybe he'll call.
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.
None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?
Come on.
An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?
What?!
No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
You didn't stop anywhere else?!
We came back to the house!
Then what?
To get some frozen poultry.
Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
I don't know. I like to think so.
He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?
Yeah! That's thinking.
Have him committed.
Millions upon millions upon millions! The cards. The stock!  The clothes! The toothpaste!  The guy was on the level!  And you blew it!  A man walks into your life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life!! And what do you do?!
See these?  Found them in the box with the cards.  These are stock certificates.  IBM.  AT&T.  Polaroid.
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
What's wrong?
We'll find him.
And if we can't find him?
Give it back to him.
What do you want to do with it?
Fallout shelter.
Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?
Oh.  Well, you're...certainly welcome!
Gay.
What?!
Oh, no!
I know...I know. You did the right thing.
Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!
Coward!
I don't think so.
You're goddamn right I am!
What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?
Oh, no! Not Sophie! No way! Please don't tell me that!!
It's true.  She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.
What?!!
He left with Sophie.
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
He didn't leave with them.
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.
Where did he get all that information?
Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...
Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
What?
You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?
Or have perfect table manners.
Yes, you do!
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
Uh, yes, you do.
And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
Yes, you do.
In the first place, I don't fall in love with weirdos I've only known for four or five days.
What?!  Now hold on!  Wait one damn minute!
Yeah.  I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
To bed?
To bed.
Where are you going?
Yeah. But who's not a slut these days?
Those sluts!
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp.  You tell me.
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
What's it to you?!
Who did he leave with?
We did not leave together.
What's that mean?
Uh..he might of.
He go back to the hotel?
Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!
Go to the bathroom.
It's not so much what you say but how you say it.  Women like men who are unpredictable.
Um... Eve?
Adam,  I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
Eve?!
Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!
For him. It doesn't work for the rest of us.
Always good advice.
Just be yourself.
He's from Alaska.
That water's freezing!
No.
How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?
Let me show you the entire trousseau!
I think...it...works.
Well, what do you think?
What do you think, Adam?
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
Alright, I will.
That's what I'm sensing.
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
I see "elegant."
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
Well, that's blunt!
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
What's that supposed to mean?
You're serious, aren't you?
Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo.
I don't know.
Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
But first, you have to start with the clothes!
Oh, my God...
Give me your hand.
I even guessed his hotel, didn't I?
Oh, yes.
Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs.
Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
So, Adam...where on earth are you from?
Darlin', this is X-File stuff!  Think about it!  The guy's got all this easily negotiable property. He's obviously setting something up very big.  Like a self-sustaining island off the coast of South America, for instance. Or perhaps he's the head of a cult that's doing weird things with poultry and pipe tobacco. I've heard worse.
I knew you'd like him.
Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!
I'll give it to ya, no money down. The neighborhood has gone to hell anyway.
Yeah!  Yeah, that's it!
Buy it from me?
Could I, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
I'm selling this place.  I want out of this hell hole!
Um...uh...
I miss those nice flower-power kids. How 'bout you?
Uh...yeah. It's like hard.
I can't tell the boys from the girls anymore!
You bet, Mom! Coming up!
I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!
Roger, Wolf One.
I'm marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
The SAR HELO is airborne with you in sight.
Tower, say again!!
Roger, Wolf One. Can you make it to the ocean?
I've got secondaries of an engine fire and I'll need to find a clear area to eject.
Wolf One -- say intentions.
Stand by. One.
Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring an emergency?
Tower. Wolf One. I've got a problem here.
-- He's just a lucky guy.
Monsieur Rick, I --
Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca has problems. Yours may work out. You'll excuse me.
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.
Go back to Bulgaria.
Oh, yes, please.
You want my advice?
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
Nobody ever loved me that much.
He always has.
-- Will he keep his word?
And you want to know --
Yes, Monsieur.
And he is still willing to give you a visa?
Oh, yes.
Does he know that?
He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.
Yes, I'll bet.
Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
So you decided to go to America.
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
How long have you been married?
At the roulette table, trying to win enough for our exit visa. Well of course, he's losing.
I thought so. Where's your husband?
He did. Captain Renault did.
-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?
No.
No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?
He is? Well, Captain Renault's getting broadminded. Sit down. Will you have a drink?
My husband is with me, too.
I should have known.
I came with Captain Renault.
How did you get in here? You're under age.
Could I speak to you for just a moment, please?
Yes?
Monsieur Rick?
But we who are still free will do all we can. We are organized, Monsieur, underground like everywhere else. Tomorrow night there is a meeting at the Caverne du Bois. If you would come...
I see.
As you see, it was true every single time. Thank heaven I found you, Berger. I am looking for a man by the name of Ugarte. He is supposed to help me.
We read five times that you were killed in five different places.
In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.
I recognize you from the news photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.
A champagne cocktail, please.
Yes, Monsieur.
Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?
I'm sorry. It is.
Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
Berger, Norwegian, and at your service, sir.
What is your name?
Good.
-- Then perhaps for the lady. The ring is quite unique.
Thank you, but I hardly think --
You will find a market there for this ring. I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.
Well?
Excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to America.
Yes, sir.
I want you to take Miss Lund home.
Yes, I come, I will do it.
-- Tonight he forgot.
But Sacha always puts out that light --
I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
Yes, I come.
Come up here a minute.
The police break up our meeting. Herr Rick! We escaped in the last moment.
Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.
Goodnight.
I won't.
-- Don't tell me where you're going.
I will. Then I am going to the meeting of the --
Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?
Oh, thank you, Herr Rick. Sacha will be happy to hear it. I owe him money.
Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.
Oh, two weeks, maybe three.
How long can I afford to stay closed?
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
Monsieur Rick!
No thanks, Carl.
Monsieur Rick, may I get you a cup of coffee?
That's all right.
It shall not happen again, Monsieur.
Here you are.
I'm awfully sorry.
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
Well, I'll get it from the safe.
Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs. The cashier would like some money.
It has been a pleasure to meet you.
Er, goodbye, sir.
I have to warn you, sir. I beseech you...
Er, my check, please.
I'd better be going.
Er, good luck, yes.
Here's to you, sir.
I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.
Well, so long.
Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.
Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.
Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.
Ah, to get out of Casablanca and go to America! You're a lucky man.
It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.
That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.
Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
I'll tell him when he comes in.
Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters.
And the carrying charges?
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.
Practically no one.
Of course not. What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are.
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.
The bourbon.  The news about Ugarte upset me very much.
Carrying charges, my boy, carrying charges. Here, sit down. There's something I want to talk over with you, anyhow.
I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.
My dear Rick, when will you realize that in this world today isolationism is no longer a practical policy?
Suppose we do.
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.
I don't buy or sell human beings.
What do you want for Sam?
It's not for sale at any price.
You haven't heard my offer.
It's not for sale.
Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.
Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?
Hello, Rick.
Good day.
It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, Mademoiselle, Monsieur.
Thank you very much. Good day.
He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.
Rick?
Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.
Do you know where they are?
Those letters were not found on Ugarte when they arrested him.
Yes, something.
I observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man, Monsieur. I am moved to make one more suggestion, why, I do not know, because it cannot possibly profit me, but, have you heard about Signor Ugarte and the letters of transit?
Well, good luck. But be careful.  You know you're being shadowed?
We've decided, Signor Ferrari. For the present we'll go on looking for two exit visas. Thank you very much.
-- We might as well be frank, Monsieur. It will take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca. And the Germans have outlawed miracles.
I will stay here and keep on trying. I'm sure in a little while --
Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible to get an exit visa for you.
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
You see, my dear, the word has gone around.
My dear Mademoiselle, perhaps you have already observed that in Casablanca, human life is cheap. Good night, Mademoiselle.
And the other alternative?
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
What are they?
There are only two other alternatives for him.
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
Occupied France?
That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.
You needn't be concerned about me.
And Mademoiselle?
She tried everything to get them, and nothing worked. She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me, but that was all over long ago. For your sake, she pretended it wasn't, and I let her pretend.
Yes.
And you never will. But I've got a job to do, too. Where I'm going you can't follow. What I've got to do you can't be any part of. Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Someday you'll understand that. Now, now...
And I said I would never leave you.
We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.
But what about us?
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
No.
I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.
-- You've got to listen to me. Do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true, Louis?
But Richard, no, I, I --
-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
No, Richard, no. What has happened to you? Last night we said --
I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.
I don't understand. What about you?
Because you're getting on that plane.
But why my name, Richard?
Oh, Rick!
Everything is quite all right.
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
No, not yet.
Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him?
I wish I didn't love you so much.
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.
All except one. He won't have you.
Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.
And Laszlo?
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.
When did you first find out he was alive?
Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work, and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me.
Why weren't you honest with me? Why did you keep your marriage a secret?
It wasn't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia. They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a two-line item in the paper: "Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp." I was frantic. For months I tried to get word. Then it came. He was dead, shot trying to escape. I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met you.
And then?
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything. All right, I'll make it easier for you.
For the last time, put them on the table.
No.
Put them on the table.
I don't have to. I've got them right here.
-- All right. I tried to reason with you. I tried everything. Now I want those letters. Get them for me.
What of it? I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it.
No. Oh, Richard, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but, but you, you are our last hope. If you don't help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.
-- I wouldn't believe you, no matter what you told me. You'd say anything now to get what you want.
Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --
I'm not fighting for anything anymore, except myself. I'm the only cause I'm interested in.
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
Please.
You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
Richard, I had to see you.
I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?
The stairs from the street.
How did you get in?
No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.
Well, I'm not running away any more. I'm settled now, above a saloon, it's true, but... walk up a flight. I'll be expecting you.
You can believe that if you want to.
Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
I don't think I will, Rick.
Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.
Yes.
Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?
It doesn't matter.
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night.
Yes, that's very pretty. I heard a story once. As a matter of fact, I've heard a lot of stories in my time. They went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs, "Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid," it'd always begin. Huh. I guess neither one of our stories was very funny. Tell me, who was it you left me for? Was it Laszlo, or were there others in between? Or aren't you the kind that tells?
It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.
Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.
I don't know the finish yet.
Has it got a wow finish?
Can I tell you a story, Rick?
Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
I didn't count the days.
Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. "Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."
I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.
Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
Please.
Especially tonight.
No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.
I love you so much, and I hate this war so much. Oh, it's a crazy world. Anything can happen. If you shouldn't get away, I mean, if, if something should keep us apart, wherever they put you and wherever I'll be, I want you to know...
Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that... Hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?
Oh, darling!
Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?
That's too far ahead to plan.
All right. At a quarter to five.  Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?
No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?
-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
Yes, of course, we --
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
I know very little about you, just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.
Strange. I know so very little about you.
Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.
Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?
Looking for a job.
Ten years ago? Let's see...  ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?
Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?
With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.
It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.
My German's a little rusty.
I'm on their blacklist already, their roll of honor.
Richard, they'll find out your record. It won't be safe for you here.
Well, only one answer can take care of all our questions.
I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
That's easy. There was. He's dead.
Uh huh.
Why there is no other man in my life?
Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.
Yes?
And I was wondering.
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
A franc for your thoughts.
Here's looking at you, kid.
We said "no questions."
Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did you think? Huh?
He hasn't played it in a long time.
There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.
I will.
Say goodnight to Sam for me.
Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out, I'll wear it again.
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
No.
Not an easy day to forget.
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
-- It was "La Belle Aurore."
Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it.
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
Oh, he never... well...  he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.
Does he always leave so early?
Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
When will he be back?
I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
Where is Rick?
Yes, ma'am.
Some of the old songs, Sam.
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
It's been a long time.
Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected to see you again.
Hello, Sam.
Yes, I'm ready.  Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
Are you ready Ilsa?
Of course, I'll be careful.
Be careful.
-- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight, dear.
Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --
I love you very much, my dear.
No, Victor, there isn't.
I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?
Yes, Victor, I was.
When I was in the concentration camp, were you lonely in Paris?
-- Yes?
Ilsa, I --
Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.
Ask me?
He suggested I ask you.
Did he give any reason?
But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.
Yes?
Apparently he has the letters.
Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
To tell you the truth, I am frightened too. Shall I remain here in our hotel room hiding, or shall I carry on the best I can?
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I am frightened.
I must. Besides, it isn't often that a man has a chance to display heroics before his wife.
Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
Our faithful friend is still there.
We'll discuss it later.
What happened with Rick?
And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.
He does. Could we have a table close to him?
I meant to, but something always held me up. I love you very much, Ilsa.
Yes, I see. When I had trouble getting out of Lille, why didn't you leave me there? And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time, why didn't you leave me then?
Yes, I would.
But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?
No, Ilsa, I won't let you stay here. You must get to America. And believe me, somehow I will get out and join you.
No, Victor, no.
Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
We are only interested in two visas, Signor.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
I will, don't worry.
Be careful.
I must find out what Berger knows.
We have been in difficult places before, haven't we?
Victor, I'm afraid for you.
This time they really mean to stop me.
Won't you join us?
You are very kind.
If we would walk out so soon, it would only call attention to us. Perhaps Ugarte's in some other part of the cafe.
Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.
You're saying this only to make me go.
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.
I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met --
I can't get over you two. She was asking about you earlier, Rick, in a way that made me extremely jealous.
-- This is Mr. Laszlo.
Well then, perhaps you also ---
Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle?
Hello, Rick.
Well, Mademoiselle, he's the kind of a man that, well, if I were a woman and I...  were not around, I should be in love with Rick. But what a fool I am talking to a beautiful woman about another man.
-- Is what?
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
Rick? Who's he?
He came from Paris with Rick.
Yes.
Sam?
Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him.
Here it is.
I understand.
But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?
Yes.
I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.
All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
Everything in order?
Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.
No. It's all arranged.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
But we made a deal.
Keep it. You'll need it in America.
I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine.
Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you.
Apparently you think of me only as the leader of a cause. Well, I am also a human being.
You love her that much?
I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know, for instance, that you are in love with a woman. It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. The first evening I came here in this cafe, I knew there was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I, I demand no explanation. I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit. All right. But I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.
You seem to know all about my destiny.
I wonder if you do. I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself and that you'll never succeed.
Yes, I get the point.
You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny, for good or for evil.
What of it? Then it'll be out of it's misery.
We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for?
Yes, rather.
Had a close one, eh?
Thank you.
Well, this might come in handy.
My wife?
I said, ask your wife.
I beg your pardon?
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?
Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
What of it?
My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.
I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper.
You must know it's very important I get out of Casablanca. It's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement. You know what I have been doing. You know what it means to the work, to the lives of thousands and thousands of people that I be free to reach America and continue my work.
Right.
My office.
Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.
Go ahead.
Monsieur Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you?
I take that as a great compliment to Sam.  I suppose he means to you Paris of, well, happier days.
Good evening. You see, here we are again.
Good evening.
Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
Good morning.
Any time.
We'll come again.
Not at all.
I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
We all try. You succeed.
Thank you. I try.
Your work.
What for?
And I congratulate you.
Won't you join us for a drink?
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Are you quite finished with us?
I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.
Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?
I believe you have a message for him?
Yes.
By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.
-- Thank you.
Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power --
I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime.
And the honor of having served the Third Reich.
Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.
I am afraid not. My regrets, Monsieur.
Thank you.
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
May we proceed with the business?
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
I slept very well.
I am delighted to see you both. Did you have a good night's rest?
Goodnight.
We'll be there.
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.
So it is. And we have a curfew here in Casablanca. It would never do for the Chief of Police to be found drinking after hours and have to fine himself.
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.
Ricky, you're becoming quite human. I suppose we have to thank you for that, Mademoiselle.
This is a very interesting cafe. I congratulate you.
Well! A precedent is being broken. Er, Emil!
No. Two champagne cocktails, please.
My bill.
Very well.
Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
No, Captain, please.
I was informed you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca. That was a gross understatement.
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
Yes. What is it you want?
I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
Yes.
Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
Good day.
For the time being.
You won't dare to interfere with me here. This is still unoccupied France. Any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault.
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all of us? From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast.
If I didn't give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more "persuasive methods" at your disposal, I certainly won't give them to you now.
You will give us the names?
Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning.
Even in Berlin.
You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.
And that is?
Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.
Is that all you wish to tell us?
Not at all. Captain Renault's signature is necessary on every exit visa.  Captain, would you think it is possible that Herr Laszlo will receive a visa?
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.
Captain Renault, I am under your authority. Is it your order that we come to your office?
Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
This is hardly the time or the place.
I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.
I've never accepted that privilege, and I'm now on French soil.
You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich!
I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian.
Ask Monsieur Rick.
Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
What is the meaning of that phone call?
Find one.
But I have no excuse to close it.
Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.
But everybody's having such a good time.
You see what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration, what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on? I advise that this place be shut up at once.
I see what you mean.
Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.
A leader, like Laszlo?
We are concerned about more than Casablanca. We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance, waiting, perhaps, for a leader.
And if it should change?
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on?
My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.
You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe.
It may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here.
As to Laszlo, we want him watched twenty-four hours a day.
But we mustn't underestimate American blundering. I was with them when they "blundered" into Berlin in 1918.
You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.
If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly.
Mademoiselle.
Mademoiselle.
Perhaps.
You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick.
I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.
Of course, one must admit he has great courage.
You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.
How about New York?
Ho, diplomatist!
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? Unofficially, of course.
Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
You repeat "Third Reich" as though you expected there to be others.
How do you do, Mr. Rick?
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.
I expected no less, Captain.
Especially so tonight, Major. In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers.
Thank you.
May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.
Champagne and a tin of caviar.
Thank you. It is a pleasure to have you here, Major.
Good evening, Captain.
Good evening, gentlemen.
I have already heard about this cafe, and also about Mr. Rick himself.
Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's.
Realizing the importance of the case, my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects.
By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
What else, my dear Major?
Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.
You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm, Major.
Major Strasser, my aide, Lieutenant Casselle.
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
Uh huh.
Our expenses?
And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.
It might be a good idea for you to disappear from Casablanca for a while. There's a Free French garrison over at Brazzaville. I could be induced to arrange a passage.
I think perhaps you're right.
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.
As soon as the plane goes, Louis.
I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
What you just did for Laszlo, and that fairy tale that you invented to send Ilsa away with him. I know a little about women, my friend. She went, but she knew you were lying.
Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.
Well I was right. You are a sentimentalist.
And the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.
You think of everything, don't you?
If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.
That is my least vulnerable spot.
Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.
Call off your watch-dogs you said.
I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means?
Put that gun down.
I have. Sit down over there.
Have you taken leave of your senses?
-- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.
Serves me right for not being musical.
Sam's piano.
Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
I have the letters right here.
Is everything ready?
Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.
You know, this place will never be the same without you, Ricky.
Oh, he won't be followed here.
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.
You're late.
Go ahead, Ricky.
Oh, thanks.
Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I.
I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
Well, she isn't just any woman.
There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.
I'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit, and that'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest. You get him, and we get away. To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance.
Then release him. You be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves.
It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.
Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know. Louis, I'll make a deal with you. Instead of this petty charge you have against him, you can get something really big, something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years. That would be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?
You didn't come here to tell me this. You have the letters of transit. You can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please. Why are you interested in what happens to Laszlo?
Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
What friend?
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
Huh?
You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.
Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.
Well, they're all excellent reasons.
Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the letters of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like him either.
-- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --
But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now.
I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
How can you close me up? On what grounds?
Well, I forgive you this time. But I'll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blonde, and it will make me very happy if she loses. Uh huh!
Put it down as a gesture to love.
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
Yeah? Why?
As I suspected, you're a rank sentimentalist.
Who knows? In her own way she may constitute an entire second front. I think it's time for me to flatter Major Strasser a little. I'll see you later, Rick.
