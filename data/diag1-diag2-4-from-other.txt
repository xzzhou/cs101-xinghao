You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?	Forget it.
There.	Where?
Sure have.	I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
Hi.	Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
do you listen to this crap?	What crap?
Wow	Let's go.
She okay?	I hope so.
They do to!	They do not!
Did you change your hair?	No.
Where did he go?  He was just here.	Who?
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.	You did what?
You looked beautiful last night, you know.	So did you
Let go!	You set me up.
But she doesn't want to date.	Exactly my point
Oh, God.  It's starting.	It's just a party. Daddy.
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.	Why?
What about him?	You wanna go out with him?
He's pretty!	Okay!  I wasn't sure
You told me that part already.	Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
Where ya goin?	Away.
Leave my sister alone.	And why would I do that?
Yeah	What do you think?
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.	Fine, thirty.
It's about time.	A deal's a deal.
How'd you do it?	Do what?
Hey.	Are you lost?
You think this'll work?	No fear.
Have you seen him?	Who?
Excuse me?	That's what you want, isn't it?
Okay?	I'm fine. I'm
Why'd you let him get to you?	Who?
I should do this.	Do what?
Oh, so now you think you know me?	I'm gettin' there
You up for it?	For. . . ?
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.	Is that right?
You think?	Oh yeah.
Say it	What?
What?!	Good enough.
I could be gone for years.	I know.
I'm not asking you to swear to anything.	I don't want you to wait for me.
Can't you stay with us a little?	I am busy inside.
I want to go with you!	There'll be a time.
You come!  You speak first!	Tell the Chief we thank him.
What do you read?	Twenty eight.
Where can I meet this man?	Immediately.
Don't say anything.	Where are we going?
I can't take you to my place.	Somewhere else?
Are you alright?	I still can't believe Eddie's gone.
I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.	C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you.	If I tell you, will you arrest me?
Only one guys checked in?	Yeah.
Are you hit?	No.  I'm okay.
Who's there?	Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
You know what that is, right?	No, what is it?
It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want.	Watch the news?
I'll come with you.	There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
I'll let you know what happens.	This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
Why not?	Something back home?
Detective, does it look like a murder?	We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done.
Detective - can you tell us what happened here?	I can't talk right now.  We have some things to take care of.
Eddie, are you okay?	Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
Hey, honey.	Hey.
Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it.	Answer the phone.
Ready?	Keep them out of my way.
Any chance we can do that again?	Again?  I didn't wanna do it the first time.
Tell him to put his gun down!	Let her go!  Let her go!!
Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.	Okay.
Don't fool around.	Okay.
Get in the bathroom!	Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!	Don't want to film this?
What is that?	What does it look like?  It's an address book!
Let me get a shot of it.	Sit down!
In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?	The one who got caught in the bathroom.  George Michael.
I'm serious.	Shut up.  Look!
You got that?	No, I don't get that!
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.	Did you hurt her?
I can get you a job.	A job?
No.  Go ahead.	Thanks.  Appreciate it.
I'll take him.	No way!  He's mine!
Mouth's clean, too.	Clean?
What?	There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no!
Now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.	Yeah?
How was it?	Not good.
Get outta here!	What the hell happened?
Take the car.  Get outta here, Tommy.	Look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
Well, that's something.	Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
Too bad about Frank, isn't it?	Yes, it is.
I'm at Space Station Five, darling. How are you?	I'm fine, Daddy. When are you coming home?
I'm having a party tomorrow.	Yes, I know that sweetheart.
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.	Thank you, Daddy.
Oh, thank you very much.	Thank you.
Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.	Are you quite sure?
Yeah?	I want to pick up my car.
This is three years old.	Yeah, I've been busy.
Now how's your memory doin'?	Fuck off.  I don't know what the hell you're talkin' about.
You're in a hurry.	Yeah, i been waiting three years.
I said police.  Now drop the goddamn gun.	Don't give me that police shit. You drop it.
I got hit.  I can't believe it. I got shot.	You're done.  End of story.
Yeah.	It looks like you bought it off one of the brothers.
Hey, this works pretty good.	Thank you.
What do you think?	I think you better put him on ice, man.
Last night.	You have a good time?
There.	Must be billy's girl.
I been waiting a long time for some money.	How much?
Where's the goddamn car?	You're a real case, you know that, Jack?
That was quick.	When you been in prison three years, it don't take long. Let's go.
You okay?	Yeah.  But I wasn't there for a second.
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.	What'd you do?
Maybe you ought to buy me one.	Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
Hard man to live with.	How would you know?
What do you want?  What's goin' on?	Shut up.
Let her go.	First, the money.
How you doing, man?	Not bad, not bad.
You sure?	I'm sure.  Everybody here's looking at everybody else's ass.
Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?	Give it back.
Who are you?	I brought the girl remember?
What are you doing?	Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
What are we going to do?	This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!	Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
I just found a picture of you.	How do I look?
I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?	I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
Yeah?	Have you pulled yourself together?
I don't even know what I'm looking for!	Fuck it! Hold tight!
What did you say? What did you do?	Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing!
I'm so very sad.	Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
Not going to open?	I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
The cash man!	Been here long?
I want your best man on this!	Don't worry, Sir. I have the perfect one.
Is that better?	Perfect, Mr. President.
Welcome home.	Do you know how much I missed you?
How's the detective business?	Business was fine.  I'll tell you what, you couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
I love you.	I love you.
What happened to you?	I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.	What can I do for you today?
That's five thousand dollars.	Is it?
I'll do this for you.  Fifteen thousand dollars.	Machine's in?
You brought the money?	Right here.
Excellent.	Where are the women?
You're a dead man.	Leave him alone.
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.	Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
Don't ask questions.	Fuck you!
I don't know.  I felt like it.  I never saw anyone get done before.	You enjoy it?
Do it.	Don't think I won't.
Give me the film.	You'll get it when we get there.
I don't know what you're looking for, mister, but so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.	Good for you.
How long you been working there?	Three, four years.
People remember me from the news.  Can you drive me back now?	Of course.
You were right.  I didn't find anything.  I'm going to run and get something to eat. Are you hungry?	Yes.
Alright.  May I have your phone number, area code first?	No, you may not.
I love to dream, I just hate ones about my dad.	You could do worse.
Not really.	Is there something we can do?
As long as your driving doesn't kill us.	It's okay, we're just about there.
You look great!	Save it for later.  Come on!
I don't get it.	Let me talk to you.
What is it?	Oh God!  He killed them!
I gotta get out of here.	You just stay put.  You need rest.
I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.	How did you know that?
Hi, you don't look very well.  Are you feeling all right?	Been having bad dreams.
I don't think this is a nice place for you to be.  Maybe we should go find your Mom.	She doesn't want me around
Who says I don't like you?	My friend, with the funny hand.
Hi, beautiful.	Jesus!  Don't do that!
Where are we going?	To take a picture.
Thanks for everything, Dad.	You sure you don't want a ride to work?
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.	Well we gotta do something!
Then get out!	Mark!
They think I'm nuts.	That's their problem.
Stop saying that, it's bullshit.	I want to talk about the baby.
It's okay.	Stick around, please?
You all wait here.  I'm going inside, take a look.	Not alone, you're not!
Yeah?	Listen!  Hear that?
And if I didn't know better - I'd swear we were moving!	Let's get back to work, and maybe we will be, soon.
You hear that?	The sound again?
Where do you think the voice you heard was coming from?	Somewhere down there?
Well?	I'm with you!
Here - keep these.  It wants me to come alone.	Oh it does???
Right at him?	That's what I said!
Well, I'll be - !	I'll be another!
What are you boys up to?	Same old shit.
He's on to us!	Shit! What are we gonna do?
I used to play ball.	Yeah?
Open the door, will ya?	Why don't you quit now, you want out so bad?
Why do they do that?	Do what?
She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.	Yes.
Dad.	I'm glad you're here. Can you stay for a while?
Please don't cry. Please, honey.	What are you sorry for?
You okay?	Yeah.
You don't mean that.	Yeah. I mean that.
Call me.	Tonight. Let's get together.
Money.	Jack doesn't need money.
I can see what you looked like as a kid.	You knew me as a kid.
Strange.	Think they're alright?
It don't look right.	What?
What was that?  You got something to say, say it! Say it!	Nothing.
Where's Ma?	She's coming.
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.	Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
Pop, for Christ's sake!	You think you can take me now? Come on, try.
Love! What the fuck do you know about love?	Love! I'm made of love!
I know what it means. I'm just running out of ways to use it.	For what?
It's not like he hasn't made us wait a few times.	Well, you aren't the President, dear.
You don't want to say hi to your father?	I'm sure he's busy.
Mom?	Yes dear?
I don't drink coffee.	You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
The woman you shot. She was my friend.	That's the way of the world, little one. Didn't they teach you that in school?
He's dead then. They must have killed him.	We don't know that.
The rest of the secret service?	Dead.
The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.	Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
Stop.	You'll do it?
There goes your ride.	Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
I'll not going without my family.	Yes, sir.
May I speak to you for a moment?	Can't it wait?
You know what?	What?
Someone should give you a raise.	Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
What's going on?	We're under attack.
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?	I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
What?	I just wish it was that simple.
Forget it.  I was reading.	I was reading too.
Are you afraid?	Not when I'm with you, Ted.
Roger.	You can do it from up here, Captain.
You can't go in there!	Don't try to stop me!
Captain, how soon can we land?	I can't tell.
Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?	That's right.
You'd better tell the Captain. We've got to land as soon as we can. This woman has to be gotten to a hospital.	A hospital? What is it?
What did he have?	He had fish.
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!	That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.	Who wants to be first?
Oh, Bill, I'm going to miss you so much.	You promise you'll write.
Oh, I can't stand it.	What is it?
Would either of you like another cup of coffee?	I will, but Jim won't.
Roger.	Huh?
Roger.	Huh?
Excuse me, Sister?	Yes?
He's not here.  Why ask me?	The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
In there.	Show me.
Kill them both.	Here?
Look, you want to fit in here, right?  You want to learn how to get along?	Yes.
What's this?  What's going on?	Nothing.
Why did you do it?	Why'd I do what?
Who said that?	At the end of the bar.
I'm going home.	Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?
Stop the car.	Why?
What was that about?	Nothing.
What's this about, George?  I know that look.	There!  Go back.  Down that side street.
How do I look?	You look very good.
Get outta there!	I can't!  Do you mind!
I'll go.	What?
What is it?	I don't know.
GET THEM OUT OF THERE!  DO IT NOW!	Shut up.  Just shut up!
We're not making that out too well.  What is it?	You tell me.  I only work here.
Well that's great!  That's just fucking great, man.  Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!	Are you finished?  You okay?
We got problems.	I don't fucking believe this. Do you believe this?
Let's go!  Let's go!	Fuckin' A!
They'll get us.	Maybe.  Maybe not.
Locked.	Stand back.
Thanks.	Uh, what's next?
And how are we today?	Terrible.
I don't want you for a friend.	Why not?
They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would.	They're dead.
Yes, there are, aren't there.	Why do they tell little kids that?
Well, some kids can't handle it like you can.	Did one of those things grow inside her?
Are we going to sleep now?	That's right.
Did you know? Had you heard?	What?
Oh - excuse me!	Is her mother still lying on the floor?
Is she a good fuck?	What??
What is it?	I want to go!
No! No! No!	Yes! Back! Back! Listen - don't you know where you are?
I think you're mad! You're really mad!	Oh, leave me alone.
There's a young girl to see you.	What does she want?
You're not going to do this?	Why not? Half the house!
Who was that?	No one.
No. Don't answer it!	Why?
Give me one reason I can understand.	I can't write it!
Go back to bed.	Please! Let me sit here. Let me stay here with you. I promise I won't say all word. I'll just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you. Please, please!
Come back tonight.	Tonight?
I see that you're expecting.	Oh, yes.
And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.	And what do you expect? Who wants to walk out into a mess like this every day?
Be careful!	Be careful!
Hey!	Hey!
I said play!	Michael!
What a strange young man.	Yes. He is a little strange.
Really?	Ah, now! Here she comes.
An interesting idea, Majesty. But -	Yes?
Yes, sir.	Well. There it is.
Why are you here?	Am I not welcome?
What's that?	Oh, let's not talk about it.
I think I've found out about the money, sir.	Yes what?
Where does he work?	In there, sir.
Now calm yourself. Calm. What's the matter with you?	I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
I'm afraid I am.	Of course, it's him. Who do you think it is?
I'm sorry. No.	Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
How long will you give me?	Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.
What happened? Is it over?	I'm taking you home. You're not well.
Shall I answer it?	No! No, it's him!
Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it.	Finish what?
Another? But that's too soon! Tomorrow night? It's impossible! Did he say a hundred?	Yes. Can I - could I help you, in any way?
The Fire.	What time?
Do you have me?	I think so.
And that's it. Do you have it?	You go fast!
Do you want to rest a bit?	Oh no. I'm not tired at all.
You mean that play?	Exactly.
That lady is back, sir.	Show her in. Then go to bed.
Oh, Miss Price?	Yes, Doctor?
He's here.	Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
Could you get here without any trouble?	Yes, I should think so.
What shall we do?	Tea would be nice.
You're a very beautiful girl.	I thought you were asleep.
My friend Jack was just here.	Your dead friend Jack?
It's nice to see you.	It's nice to see you.
He's playing a stupid joke, sir.	What?
Feeling better?	No.
How are we feeling tonight?	No.
He all right?	Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
Officer, I killed those people last night.	You did, did you?
All right, you two, move along.	Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
No one brought them here! No one wanted them here!	You could have told them!
Miss Price! Miss Price, please!	Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
Are you cold?	Yes.
Jack.	David.
Hello.	Nice to see you.
Nice looking group.	Listen, at least it's warm in here.
Go on, ask them.	You ask them.
What do you think was wrong?	I have no idea.
Did you hear that?	I heard that.
Could be a lot of things.	Yeah?
Shit! David, what is that?	I don't know. Come on.
What's the plan?	Plan?
It's in front of us.	Do you think it's a dog?
See anything?	No.
It sounds far away.	Not far enough. Come on.
Jack?	Yeah.
Nice to see you.	Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
I'm going completely crazy.	David!
It's you, David.	What?!
You're not real.	Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.
What are you doing here?	I wanted to see you.
Hi, Jack.	Hi, David.
What can I say, Jack?	You don't have to say anything.
Because this must be stopped.	How shall I do it?
No, thank you.	I'd like some tea, please.
Hello, Tom.	You here again? What do you want?
What do you suppose anybody wants? Money, money, money!	Listen, I told you I wasn't interested in that deal, didn't I?
Say, do me a favor, will you Charlie?	Yeah.
Whose death?	It'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
We want to talk to you.	What about?
What do you mean?	All you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we'll do the rest, see?
What?	Don't you know I've been crazy about you for years?
What's this?	My apartment.
Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you.	I'm listening.
Shall we let the people come in?	Of course, let them in! You're late now.
Well, look who's here! Hello, dear.	Hello, darling.
What's the matter dear? What have I done now?	Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
Longer.	I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
I already told him I was home.	There you are.
My wife? What's she got to do with you?	No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
We can't keep open till four o'clock. We haven't cash enough to last an hour.	Don't you think I know it?
What did you do with it?	With what?
No.	Oh, you think I'm lying?
What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?	Yeah.
What's keeping you?	Oh, Charlie again.
What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?	Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
What time was it?	Huh?
Then who changed it?	I don't know.
So you were home last night?	Yes.
Everybody in?	I guess so.
How many of them did he kill?	Two.
'Bout time you got here, buddy.	What's going on?
Ride with me, cousin?	I could use the walk.
Not now.	What is wrong with you?
I got seven thousand.	I got three.
We'll make them pay for this.	I'm out.
Missed you, cousin.	Missed you too, cousin.
I think one of 'em's glass.	Which one, right or left?
The safe. Now.	Of course!  Uh, sir?
Frank, don't you have something to say?	You're doing just fine.
You know him?	Heard of him.
How'd it go in there?	Fine. How'd it go out here?
We're drunk.	Oh yeah.
Uncle Frank?	Yeah Jimmy?
Ma! Please!	Boys?
You shouldn't be up.	I've been on my back two weeks. I'm sick of it.
I don't understand.	She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
Don't turn around.	What?
Oh. That's nice to know.  We're going to hang you, you know.	I figured.
That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else.	He's too important, James.  They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.
Now let's have a drink.	Right here in church?
And you're too young.	I'm the same age you were when you went off to war.
I like that.	No.
Well, not exactly.	You been with a girl ever?
With my money!	We should go burn that school to the ground, sir!
This is him.	I remember you.
You wouldn't have done that?	Oh no, I would have done that. But I would have made sure I killed them, too.
So he's won.	No.
See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch?	Oh God, just get it over with.
I haven't seen you around here.	You just haven't been looking.
Nothing like last time, promise.	Alright.
You're really serious, aren't you?	Yes, I am.
If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.	Oh God, I can't believe this.
Where are you going?	I'm just leaving.
Are you my two o'clock?	No.
Doesn't he live here?	No, he doesn't.
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?	What exactly do you mean?
SHUT UP!	Calm down. Let's do it anyway
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.	Leaving what?
Anywhere you want?	Let's not think about what I want. How about anywhere you want.
Do you have a boyfriend?	No, not really.
So, what do you do?	What do you think I do?
Well.	Isn't it ridiculous? Coming all the way up here, but you know. They really are the best.
Pardon me, but are you okay?	Who do you ask?
Would you rather I not smoke?	No, I guess it's okay.
He does? You're sure?	I checked it out. It's clean.
I'm so hungry.	It's cold out, too, isn't it?
Gee, uh, that's too bad.	I'm so hungry.
It's the way he said it. Just the way my dad did, when he was caught in a lie. That's how you knew you were onto something ugly.	What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there?	Nothing.
Look at this.	What?
Great!	Look at me! I'm gonna change.
You look beautiful.	Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
Here we go.	Great.
What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.	I am. I am, sir.
How's it going?	Maybe I'm going too fast.
Ready for number three?	Let's go.
I think you should go.	You do?
Come with me.	Where we going?
Did you wanna be alone?	No. Please.
How close are you?	What?
That kid's the great white hope.	I could get it out of him.
Who're these guys?	Where is he?
You seem surprised to see me.	I thought you'd quit while you were ahead.
Come in.	I'd rather talk about Number Two.
Do you mind if I ask you a personal question?	Is it about my teeth?
She's working on another lead right now.	Then you'll have to go it alone. Good luck.
I haven't had fun like that since college.	I'm sorry.
I have something to tell you.	Lay it on me.
No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.	No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece.
I'm proud of you.	Why?
No, it's been too long. Best to leave things alone.	I'm on with a friend!  Look, I'd better go. I love you.
How long have I been here?	Three days.
You	Have we met?
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.	Promised? Who promised?
What on earth?	Any ideas?
Not quite. This is my field.	Is there anything that isn't?
I could save you the trouble.	No trouble.
No, after you.	You don't trust me?
Aren't you coming?	I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
I was getting to it.	Getting to what?
You with Mother or Father?	Both, actually.
What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?	They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.
What?	You're kidding.
All right!	When do the girls get to the party?
I don't want any trouble.	Oh, come on, just a little.
Great car.	The best.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!	Maybe it had something to do.
Nice shot.	Thank you, sir.
So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?	What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
This is it, lady. Last stop.	Can't I just go with you guys?
I can't trust you!	C'mon, I knew it was you.
I don't believe you.	You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
Are you okay?	Yeah.
Give him the works.	That's more like it.
You okay?	Yeah, I guess so.
Welcome, welcome, one and all.	Rick!
What the hell is that?	My gift to you.
I think you'll enjoy this table.	So long, Father.
Rick, I'm concerned.	About what?
Who was that?	I don't know.
Now, don't get into any trouble.	Take care.
You're late again, Rick.	I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
It doesn't go like that.	Who asked you?
Hey.	Hey.
I saw it.	Saw what?
Anything else?	What are we going to do about this?
Hey.	How's it going?
Hi.	Hi.
I'm sorry.	That's a dumb thing to say.
Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?	Who's doing this?
That's it! Oh, that son of a bitch, he's different, goddamn it! You see what this tells us, huh? Our killer doesn't love fire!	What?
Did you pull me out?	Yeah.
Your brother was a good man.	Yeah.
Completely out of control.	What the hell are we waiting for?
You don't know him.	I know you.
Are you all right, honey?	I was gonna bring it back myself.
I forgive you.	Me?
I forgive you.	Why? Why can't you hate me? Hate me! Please! Help me!  Hate me! Help me! Hate me!
Oh, really?	Yeah, really. I'm no fucking asshole, man. I'm a fucking cop!
OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?	I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
Do you have the money?	What money?
How's the case going?	What case?
Keep trying.	I'm on it.
What kind of show is this gonna be?	Different.
I would like to change your name.	To what?
What do you want?	I want to speak with you.
Enough about me, what's happening with you?	The same old, same old.  Trying to get my stuff through.
How long has my father been like this?	Not that often.  He was excited to see you.
Don't tell him it's from me or he won't take it.	Your father is proud of you.
This is the group I was telling you about.	Which one is your brother?
Just want to say good luck.	Break a leg.
Your life will never be the same.	Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
Same here.	The pleasure is mine.
Who's side are you on?	I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny.
What is this?	A gift.
Why'd you do that?	I don't want to hear it.
This is crazy.	That's why it will be so much fun.
He wants you to come and see him.	He said that?
Nice to meet you.  If you don't mind me asking you - how old are you?	I just turned twenty.
A lot?	Enough.
So what's up with you?	What do you want to know?
Why don't you call him?	For what?  He left.  Not me.
You're sure this is a good idea.	My people love me.
Good day to you, young sir.	Good morning.
No.	Have you had one?
Then this must be done tomorrow.	What is to be done?
Can I at least have a drink?	It's ten thirty in the morning.
Why'd you ask for a cop, Ray?	I'm not telling you what happened.
Some.	Tell me about them.
What do you mean, West's?	I mean I killed him.  Isn't that what we all wanted?
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.	You saw West, right? How was he killed?
Is it the truth?	There's that word again.  As I told you, I wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting.
I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?"	Well?
Why?	Because of what I saw.  Who really killed West.
How do you know?	Because I was standing next to him.
I'm sorry, Bill.	Don't be. I'm not cut out to deal with the West's of the world.
You wanted to break him.	Yeah.
So what now?	Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.	Right back where we started.
What?	Seven guys. What was it you said? You were "just starting to believe I wasn't the guy people said".
West?	Nobody saw. But I don't think so.
What are you doing out here?	Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
He was your friend.	Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks.
He couldn't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own.	He wanted more than that.
Hey kid! Your friend just made himself a star.	That's great.
See! The big guy likes it.	I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.
I was wrong about you kid. You may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. You could get any girl.	There's only one I want.
You were expecting me?	Not yet.
I have to leave. Tonight.	Why?
You won't find a better place!	I don't expect to.
Or are you too scared?	I'll go in right now and get that eye.
You get the eye?	I brought it.
Can I see him?	Absolutely. Be good for you to talk to him.
How long have you known my father?	Thirty years. Maybe more.
Did you see that woman?	What did she look like?
Okay.	Okay.
People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go.	Really.
When did you ever work in an office?	There's a lot you don't know about me.
What do you want, Will? Who do you want me to be?	Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
The river.	The river?
Tell me how it happens.	How what happens?
You become what you always were. A very big fish.  And that's the way it happens.	Yes. Exactly.
You don't even know me.	I have the rest of my life to find out.
Oh. Oh.	Hello.
I'm going to check on him.	I need to lie down for a bit.
I'm going with you.	You don't have to.
I talked with your father last night.	Did you?
Look, I know why you like him. I know why everyone likes him. But I need you to tell me I'm not crazy.	You're not.
Mom, would you say you understand Dad?	Of course.
Mom?	Yes?
Mom, do you want some time with Dad?	Yes. Thank you.
You first.	Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
It's enough isn't it?	What do you mean?
Do you like it?	Yeah.
Say thank you.	Thank you.
A baby? What are we supposed to do with a baby?	Name it.
What? What are you doing?	What are you doing here?
What did he say?	He says he feels safe here.
What was that?	I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.
She says she has a secret to tell.	What?
What was that?	Oh nothing.
How is bank?	Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
I understand. I'm so sorry	You can stay tonight.
Oh Jesus.	He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
Just leave her alone.	I'm so sorry.
Is that everything?	Yes.
They go. John. They go.	What's wrong?
Give me some money.	I don't have any money.
What?	I said I don't have any.
I don't want to talk about it.	Why not?
It wasn't what I wanted.	So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?
Excuse me?	Get out
Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?	No.
I'm sorry.	I don't know why I said that. She's not dead at all.
What?	I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
She's alive!! She is not dead?	Laugh it up.
I don't know.	What was her name?
I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?	No. I think I better just go.
Yeah. No thanks.	Please. Why not?
Okay. Goodbye.	Goodbye.
Something else.	Okay. Promise?
It's not mine.	It's not mine either.
Why?	I'm not asking you to marry me.
What does it mean?	Maybe you will find out.
Hurry. I'll wait for you here.	Right.
Is the flight full?	I'm sorry Sir. I believe the flight is closed.
You have excellent English.	Thanks.
What are you doing?	Just wanted to see.
This was very sweet of you.	Well. Hope you enjoy it.
Hi.	Hey.
Look it. I got somethin' for us. This is gonna help, okay.	You gonna miss your bus.
Holy shit.	Yeah.
You gonna steal my truck?	Make yourself at home. You done it already.
Better?	Yeah.
YOU SHUT UP!	Careful how you point that gun, boy.
Like a man.	Yes. I mean that's it. I wanna feel like a man with her. I wanna feel like the only man with her.
Now you get up! And you get in my house!	Or what?
You take it straight?	Sure.
Could you do somethin' for me?	Anything.
Where you gonna be?	Right here. Be here all afternoon.  You ready for this?
You took care of your wife, like you do me?	I tried.
What is it?	Nothin'.
I don't want you to let go.	Maybe I won't.
How a girl get like that?	Like I told you.
You get a call from Rose?	This ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. Just don't want nobody around me now.
You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. I got my mind made up and I ain't gonna be moved on this.	Ain't gonna be moved?
Are you outta ya GODDAMN MIND?	Man like you ought not take the Lord's name like you just done.
Heard about this morning.	We ain't here to talk about that shit.
Hey.	Hey.
I think it'd be better if you talk to me.	Yeah?
I feel better. Do you?	Yeah, I do.
What happened to your face?	Got in a little accident.
You got any money?	Thought you had a man for that.
Hey, hey, where you goin'?	Home.
Charlie, don't do anything.  Promise me?	What?
Some party.	Maybe we should do something?
This the right place?	I hope not.
Are you expecting anyone?	I wasn't expecting you.
How'd you get this?	I stole them.
What's he saying?	He says they're very nice.  He wants to know if you have anymore.
What'd I tell you?	There she is!
It's very small.	Big enough.
Thank you.  You have one?	A wife.  She left.
What's that for?	Luck.
You know, Nick, we can't lose.	Why's that?
Think we'll get him, Nick?	We can't lose.
Don't give him any more.	He gets as much as he wants.
Where's the wife?	You met her.
Keep the change.	I'm taking you back.
It's not your job.	He was my partner.
Because I want you to tell me.	The young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.
That wasn't our deal.	You want him dead too.
We're not used to the big city. Where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.	You certainly have a nice place here.
Let's go while there is still time.	Where?
One man.  He must be good.	Then go get him.
Show me something?	Like what?
You're our best and only friend.	Thank you.
What's going on down there?	He's not ready yet.
Then we're stupid and we'll die.	Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home?
I didn't like her.	You didn't like her!?
Well, when do you get paid?	Soon as I finish the job.
I think I have no money.	It's okay.  Forget it.
You want to see my friends?	Sorry, don't have the time.
How long you had these guys?	Two months.  But this one is not guy.  It is girl.  His girl.
You like to kiss her goodbye.	No thanks.
I like you.	I like you too.
How old am I?	I don't know.
Why didn't you go?	Too old.
My job is here.	Me too.
I'd like  you to take a look at these pictures.	Of course.
The best.	Does it eat?
Me.	And who do I go to about you?
Do I make you nervous?	Yeah.
I can imagine.	Can you?  I couldn't.
They probably want to find out when they were made.	Right.
I told you I'd come back.	You did?
Who is this?	Me and my dad.
Do you dream?	Yeah.  Sometimes.
Did you cry when your father died?	Yeah.
Have you ever known anybody a long time?	You mean a woman?
Don't leave here.  Don't open the door, don't answer the phone.	What difference will it make?
You know what I think?	What?
Thanks.	Black?
May I ask a personal question?	Go ahead.
Well?	If she is, the machine works.
How come you were in my truck?	I was tired and didn't have any place to go.
You want to go home?	I don't have one.
Where are your folks?	They left.
We scared each other pretty good didn't we?	We sure did.
Twenty.	What's your problem?
Ah, you get hold of your friends?	As a matter of fact I did.  They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.
What makes you think so?	You're all so perfect.
Hi!	Yes?
Oh, now, that's a great one!	You like it?
Get out of here!	No, you get out of here.
I came on a bus.	Why doesn't that surprise me?
So far?	Yes, I'm right?
I'm sorry!  I said something wrong, didn't I!  Please forgive me!	Get away from me!!
So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do is drive you to your hotel?	Yes.
Wait!  Wait!	What is it?!
Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.	Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
See, ya.	Why doesn't it never work out?
You got it! Wait here while I change.	Sure.
Wait! Wait!	What?
There's something else I would like you to help me with.	Name it.
When do you need her by?	Two weeks.
Could we talk about that a little later?	Of course.
Now, get out!!	Yes, ma'am!
All right.	So, what are you seeing?
No!  Not crazy!	Do I look crazy?
I thought I was here to meet women.	Not that one!
What about her?	No way.
Okay. I like that.	Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
That's ridiculous.	Maybe. But that's how it works.
I don't blame you!	Eve, I'm sorry.
There.	Thanks.
That's right?	I've never met anyone like you in my life.
This must be very new.	Yeah.
That's why little things mean so much to him.	I LOVE THIS!!
Hello.	Hi.
Oh. A nice one, I hope.	Yes, ma'am.
I'm afraid you've got to.	I'll be all right.
Right.	I just hope this is still good up there.
Mom?  Eve and I have to go.	What?
We have to go.	No, wait! At least stay for dinner!
You got a light, honey?	What?!  A light!  Yes, I've got a light!
You hear that?!	Yes.
How long will we have to stay down here?	I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
Home sweet home!	To you maybe.
To go up.	To go up.
Hi, honey! Feeling better?	No.
Oh, no.	What?
Watch this!	What?
Hi, honey!	Hi.
No kidding.  Who else would have done it?	And I made these!
He's smart.	Yes, dear, I know.
How long will you set it for this time?	I thought ten years.
Stop it, you two!	I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
You're serious, aren't you?	What's that supposed to mean?
Just be yourself.	Always good advice.
What's that mean?	We did not leave together.
Where are you going?	To bed.
What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?	You're goddamn right I am!
Oh, no!	What?!
What do you want to do with it?	Give it back to him.
Frank. Come in.	Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer.
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?	Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
Jeffrey?	Yes?
These are beautiful. How's the case coming?	Okay.
That's right. That's what I said. You have a good memory. Then what?	Well.
What do you want from me?	I, I don't know.
Do you like that?	Yes.
Do you like talk like that?	No.
Don't.  I don't like that. What do you want?	Nothing. Are you alright?
Don?	No.
Thank you. honey.	It's okay. It's okay.
Do you like the way I feel?	Yes.
You can hit me, if you want to.	No, please. I won't.
Do you like me?	Yes, I like you.
Hi, can I come in?	Yeah, hurry up though.
I liked being with you last night.	Same here.
Oh shit.	Frank? Can you stand up?
Nice guy. Who's he?	Who's it, you mean.
Oh God. Don!!! Why can't I just die.	There you go again. Stop saying that. You can make it.
Look.	No.
Who is Don?	Don? Are you in with them?
Come in.	Hello.
Do you like my body?	Sure I do.
What do you want to do?	I'm doing it.
You like to open me, don't you?	Yes.
That wouldn't be too good, would it?	Frank would open you.
Do you love me?	Do you love me?
I love you Don with all my heart.	No, it's not Don.
I guess I should go.	I want you to stay with me.
I'll call you.	Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
Oh no.	No.  Hi baby.
Yeah, it's me.	Oh God, Jeffrey, is that you? Oh God.
Where have you been?  Oh God, they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.	It's okay. It's okay.
Hold me, Don.	Don? Where is he?
Frank gone?	Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
MOMMY!	Mommy's here.
Look at these. What are these?	Come on, Frank. Let's go. Please.
No thanks.	No thanks. What does that mean?
Hey? You like to walk.	What?
What are you lookin' at?	Nothing.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?	This is it.
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.	Be right down.
Can I use the car tonight?	Of course, Jeffrey.
God, you scared me.	Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
He comes over to study.	Yeah.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?	That sounds great!
Good to see you, son.	It's good to see you, Dad.
What happened to him?	I don't know. He moved away.
I don't want to cause any trouble.	I'm here, aren't I?
Are you alright?	Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?
You really want to do this, don't you?	I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
That sounds good.	Two.
Here's to. An interesting experience.	I'll drink to that.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.	Why not?
Well, how did it go? What happened?	Well, I've found out some things, nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
Can I give you a kiss good night?	You better not, Jeffrey.
You were late.	I'm really sorry.
Great. Hey, I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things that could help your father but you might get into trouble.	Jeffrey, are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey, I mean it.
Okay.	What is it?
What was that all about?	Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
You want to dance?	I can't dance fast.
You want to dance?	Okay.
Oh my God. What's wrong?	Frank!!!
My father has a gun at home.	No.
Come on out a minute, okay?	Okay.
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.	Stop it Mike.
There's ways around that.	Go find one.
Lord's name.	Mother Mary, full of grace.
Are ya ready?	Aye.
Anybody you think is evil?	Yes.
Look again for fuck sake!	I know what the fuck he looks like!
Shit.	What?  What, that guy?
You guys?	We're here brother.
Hold this shit for us, Doc. We'll be comin back for it when we get out.	Right.
Absolutely not.	No pictures, either.
Nervous?	A bit.
Where the fuck are you going?	We'll find it. Just calm down.
Where are you goin'?  Did you tell him?	Yes.
Who did you kill?	Holy shit. Who? How many?
What?	Where's my cat?
Now, what is this going to look like to those who do not know what I just told you?	It's gonna look like the bad guys are killing each other.
Promise me boys.	We promise.
Hurry the fuck up!	This is some crazy shit, man!
You gonna do what I say, got it?	Yes.
Don't do this my son.	Open it!
Do your thing Father. Don't fuck this up.	What do you want me to say?
Why?	As part of his plan. I don't know why.
Did you see what I meant about the window?	Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
Did you see that?	Yeah, I saw it.
Holy shit. What'd I tell you?	Eight dollars.
But he didn't say anything.	Hang on a second.
Is it back in?	Yeah.
Holy shit.	We got it. We got it.
I swear to God. In a very quiet voice.	Like he meant it.
What's wrong with him?	What do you think?
I'll just say it.	I'll say it.
You owe me fifty bucks.	Bob?
I thought you guys went to get your hair cut.	No. We didn't.
May I have a word with you, please?	Sure.
What the fuck is going on here?	What. What's the matter?
See, now we've got a plan.	Don't worry about it, Bob.
When'd he tell you?	This morning.
Why don't you come with us.	OK.
I wish I'd been there.	Would of been nice.
I have an idea for that.	What?
When'd you get back?	Ah. Couple days ago.
I want you to look at this.	What is it?
What time did he say to be here?	Right now.
What do you think?	He seems pretty good.
He doesn't want to fight.	Get out of the way.
Or I might end up with a broken nose.	Did that hurt?
I'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.	I don't think you will.
He was a nice guy.	He was all right.
Uh-huh?	Take your second position.
Who did that? What the fuck is that?	It's going back down.
What are you doing?	Let's go. Come on.
Come on.	I'll see you there.
Why?	We're not sure.
Mr. Henry never gave you a test, did he?	What do you mean?
Where?	Behind Bob's house.
So how is it in there? 	What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to.
I think I may have found a way out of here.	You're kidding.
And you're wrong if you think, I'd turn my back on a friend.	Hold it.
How does that feel?	It feels good.
Future Man.	Who?
Let them fight.	Let them fight.
Are you serious?	Yeah. He said that.
See you.	See you, Bob.
You'll probably have them the rest of your life.	What was that?
Where you going?	Move.
Will you guys shut up? God. It's like having two little kids in the car.	OK, Dad.
What?	Is that OK?
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.	No, I don't mind.
Let's not even talk about it.	It was stupid.
Jesus, Bob.	I didn't do anything.
Yeah.	Who's got the car keys?
Is that him?	Wait a second.
What?	Bob! Get back in position!
Well, what do you think?	I don't know, Bob. What about one of those?
If you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one.	What are you talking about, Bob?
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?	Good question.
What was that all about?	I can't believe you said that.
Where'd she go?	Maybe she turned.
I think we might of scared her.	Let's just go.
Bob.	I'm paying attention. I just want to look at it for a minute.
What are you doing?	I'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
How much is there?	Don't count it.
You really think he'll remember you?	No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
Bob, will you please listen?	I don't want to talk about it.
Way to go, Bob!	I told you they were there.
Shit, Bob. What the fuck did you do that for?	He wouldn't move.
Bob. Are you coming?	See you in a little while.
You can go first, Bob.	My brother's in jail.
How long has he been in there?	I don't know.
What do you mean get back?	Well, obviously, we got to go back.
You've got a beautiful walk, Bob.	Let's go.
It's too bad about what happened on the road.	Yeah. It is.
It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother.	I didn't have any choice.
I'm sorry, Bob.	That's OK.
That's OK.	Look. We want you on the job.
Come on, Bob.	I know it, man. Hang on.
I couldn't hear anything.	Who's watching the door? What the fuck are you doing? Get back in position.
You keeping out of trouble?	I'm trying.
Your brother was up here the other day. He said you ran away from home.	He said what?
Is he good?	He's damn good.
You got to have fun with it. There's no point if you're not having any fun. Would you like me to be there tomorrow?	Yes.
We're closed, sir.	Where's that guy going?
Hello, my friend. You in the Army, yes?	No. I just have short hair.
I don't know.	She is a good looking woman.
Well, we'll see you later, Bob.	Pleasure to meet you, John.
Sorry to wake you.	I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
Sit down.	I'd rather stand if it's all the same to you.
Who else knows about this?	Nobody. You.  I had to tell you, right?
Of all the people in the world, you're the only one I have anything to offer.  That's why I came here.	Okay.
I would want to know.  I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself.	What?
I have to go now.	Is this really happening?
So why didn't you kill me then?	She wouldn't let me.  She's the only reason you're alive.
Try again.	Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?	I don't know.
You called it in?	I'm sorry.
Sleep. Sleep now.	I should be better by now.
You drive.	What?
I love you, too.	Tell me later.
I wanted to kill him.	But you found another choice.
I know it's a dream.	You do?
How do they know that? How can they know any of that?	What is this, a game?
And you got to him before we could.	I killed him???
What do you want?	I want to come in.
Okay, how do you want to do it?	I want someone I know to take me in.
We need to get in there.	I'm working on it.
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?	I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
Show me.	Here?
This is everything? Is there.	Is there. Is all there.
I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.	And why is that?
Let's give him half an hour.	So?
He won't come.	He will. I know he will.
Rest, William.	I rest.
Keep these. We're going too.	No. One of us is enough.
They're coming!	How many?
You'll move	I will not.
Come, it'll help you sleep.	Aye. But it won't let me dream.
We're gonna be late again.	When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
What happened?	Honey. What were you doing with that?
There must be a way to fix this.	Fix?
You're. Acting. Like your father.	Come on, Mom. Just 'cause Dad was my age when he started going crazy doesn't mean that I'm nuts.
Are you stupid or what?	What?
Not since we were kids.	I've stopped a hundred times.
I don't understand, where are you taking me?	You'll see.
I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.	Go on. Sit down.
Are you okay?	What do you mean?
Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone.	Nice to see you, too. Can I come in?
What's happened to you?	You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
I just thought you should know.	Know what?
There's one major hole in your story.	Which is?
Where am I? What happened? Where did we all go?	Calm down, kid. Stand still.
What time is it?	It's time for you to stand where the hell I told you.
That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!	Been there, done that.
That should buy you ten minutes at least.	Gee, thanks friend.
Look what you made me do!	What's wrong with you?!
What the hell are you doing?	It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?	No.
Nobody ever loved me that much.	And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
Excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to America.	Well?
Good.	What is your name?
Say goodnight to Sam for me.	I will.
Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did you think? Huh?	We said "no questions."
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.	No, no, no, no. We must leave.
Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.	No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
Can I tell you a story, Rick?	Has it got a wow finish?
I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.	All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
But why my name, Richard?	Because you're getting on that plane.
It's been a long time.	Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
Where is Rick?	I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
When will he be back?	Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
You are very kind.	Won't you join us?
Goodnight.	Goodnight.
Goodnight.	Goodnight.
Be careful.	Of course, I'll be careful.
How do you do?	How do you do?
We'll come again.	Any time.
Good evening.	Good evening. You see, here we are again.
Everything in order?	All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
I understand.	Here it is.
For the time being.	Good day.
Good evening, gentlemen.	Good evening, Captain.
You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick.	Perhaps.
Is that a serious offer?	I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
Yeah, you were saying?	Excuse me.
Where were you last night?	That's so long ago, I don't remember.
Hello?	Put that phone down!
Thank you.  Will you have a drink with me please?	No.
Rick! Rick, help me!	Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
Boss!	Yeah?
What's that you're playing?	Just a little something of my own.
Where is she? Have you seen her?	No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.
Save some for tomorrow.	Catch another fish tomorrow.
Get up.	Feels so good to lie here.
Can't.  Need water.	You've had today's water.
No more water, you said.	Take it.
What are you doing?	Can't kill another one.  Can't.  Can't kill my friends anymore.
I'm lost.  Goodbye.	No!
What's so damn funny?	You are.
You can't make it.	Shut up.  I don't feel like dying today.
You know what happened to this?	As much as anybody.
Yeah, a long one.	I've got lots of time.
Four four.  A record.	You don't seem too happy about it.
He is a cute thing.	He's your cute thing.
Why didn't you come over, get mad at me, tell me what a stupid bitch I was.	I guess I hadn't thought through how I felt.
Right back, you said you'd be right back.	A few things came up.  Or went down.
I got married.	I thought you might have.
You okay?	Great.  Really.
What will you do?	I don't know.  I really don't know.
If you say you are.	I most definitely say I am.
Thought you were going to bring her.	So did I.
How'd it go?	Great.  Terrific.  The good guys won one for a change.
You what?	It was fifteen minutes late.
To life.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.	To life.
Take your time.	What?
Not just that.  Take your time.  Use it. Live it.	Deep, real deep.
How many months are you?	Two.
I better go.	I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?	It will be okay.
Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do.	Nothing.
Do you think she'll be all right?	She knows how to take care of herself.
I thought they might take me.	They wanted a girl.
It's big enough to keep you out of the war, I suppose. Ain't that right?	Right.
I thought it was my turn.	It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
What's that?	It's just my heart.
You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope.	No trouble.
I'm not in trouble.	Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is.
You're not yet three months, are you?	Not yet. What do you know about it?
But I'm not that late. You didn't have to give away my seat.	I wasn't sure if you'd make it.
Thanks for playing along. I just have to sit for a while.	Tough day?
Oh. Well, thanks for the drink.	You're welcome. I was just going to ask you if you'd like to join us.
I can see why you liked her.	That was it. We had our crew. Now we needed the Mark.
We were back on.	After you cut her loose.
I'm going home	Let's go, Jake?
What? I can feel you looking at me.	That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.
You know what we're doing with the money.	And what about Big Al?
When?	Tonight. Just me.
How much we going after?	Two million.
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.	We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
She up for this?	She's up for it.
Why?	You ask a lot of questions. Come on.  Let me see 'em.
How much?	I think two million.
Come here. Feel this.	No thanks. I'm good.
Oh Jesus!	LISTEN to me! We don't have much time. We can still get through this but you have to keep your head and trust me!
What is this? You guys cops or something?	We're not cops.
Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.	Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off.
What the hell's his problem?	Don't worry about it.
He's gone.	Uh-huh.
You told me to change my hair!	What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
Yeah.	You better get over to Al's. Now.
Meet me at my place later.	How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
Him.	You sure?
When this is all over, you're going to tell me who the King put on Al.	You going to have the time?
The King, huh? Nice going.	I try.
What?	Consider him part of your crew. Consider him a part of me.
Did he buy it?	I think so. What'd he ever do to you anyway?
You sell it.	To who?
What are you doing?	High five.
Jack. Do you need a ride?	No. Thanks.
What kind of deal you looking to?	What's the Blue Book price?
How about fifteen hundred?	How about five hundred.
I found her in bed with someone.	Who was he?
What's the time?	I don't know.
How did it go?	Fine.
When you get home, I'm asleep. When I leave home, you're asleep.	I'll see you in my dreams.
I don't like it.	Why not?
The door, Jack.	Leave it.
What?	You were talking in your sleep.
How did you know I was here?	I thought you wouldn't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here.
Great.	Found a job?
I've lived there.	Well, thank you anyway.
Oh hello.	You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.
How did you hurt your hand?	Just an accident. Nothing.
I'm in trouble.	What kind of trouble?
They mean it.	Who's they?
And I thought you were only after my body.	I've come to know you. You're honest.  I trust you.
Next time it'll be my neck.	What about my neck?
How much do you owe?	Let it go.
I'm sorry.	What for?
Is it yes?	Yes.
Would you like a drink?	No thank you.
Where to?	Turn left at the lights.
Where do you live, Jack?	Over the river.
So how do you feel, your first night? I'll bet you're on a high.	Nice car.
What are you, a cop?	If I see you do it again, I'll report it.
Hey Jack, join us.	No thanks.
You want me to check?	I said good call.
Girlfriend?	Yes.
What's he doin'?	I think he's talking to it.
The key!	Key? Key? What is the key?
Hello, bomb, are you with me?	Of course.
What are you gonna name it?	What?
See what you don't know is you're already in the last two minutes of your life.	You're in the last two seconds, you don't cut the crap.
Some of us are trying to sleep.	You didn't tell me you lived with her.
Move it.	Where?
How're ya doin', Max.	You mean until you showed up?
Out there.	No way.
What're you looking for?	A grand.
What makes you cry?	If I'm sad, or tired, or sometimes when I'm angry or when somebody's being mean to me.
Sorry about your window.	Can we go somewhere and talk?
How'd you find me?	Wasn't that hard.
What's this?	Open it.
Know where I can find her?	You don't want to.
This is not a place you wanna go.	Let go of my hand.
Say the words, "I understand."	I understand.
I asked you to keep that thing outside.	You did.
I don't know what your story is and I don't want to.	Here's your money.
Gotta go.	Where?
Not right now.	Not right now?  Okay, when?
Who are you?	What, you gonna put me on your Christmas card list?
Make the call.	She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
Can you put that in a bag or something?	You get it when I get her.
Catch you back at the wall.	Later.
This is a hot run.  Beat it.  You're late.	I was on call. 
What about this?	I'm taking the rest of the day off 'cause I'm not feeling so hot.
No problem.	Thanks.
Sorry.	It's okay.
Coming dad.  I'll call you. Soon as we get a phone. Bye.	Bye.
What are you, high?	Yeah.
Any luck?	Plenty, but it was all bad.
Second floor girls' john! Two minutes! He'll never look there!	Check!
Cool.	I'm really sorry about that, man.
Oh, hi, mom.	NOW!
Trip, you fuckin' asshole.	What?
I did it! I did it! We won!	We won?!
Oh, yeah! You and what army?	The KISS Army!
Gimme your gun, boy!	No, you gimme your gun, boy!
I did?	Yeah, you did!
I feel bad for his family.	Yeah.
I want to show you something.	You have to do something for me first.
What happened to your eye?	I am so sorry.
Wanna walk me home?	Sure.
You're weird.	I'm sorry.
Where are you going?	I'm going home.
What happened to your neck?	I don't want to talk about it.  So what happened to your neck?
We're moving through time.	What?
What? How long was I asleep?	The whole movie. Let's go.
Hey.	Hey. You OK?
Did you call the cops?	Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.
Come with me.	Where are we going?
So, I met a new friend.	Would you like to talk about this friend?
Do you believe that the world is coming to an end?	No.  That's stupid.
What is going to happen?	Frank is going to kill.
So I hear you have a girlfriend.	Yeah.
How much are they paying you to be here?	Excuse me? What's your name, son?
Has your son ever told you about Frank?	Come again?
Our son just called me a bitch.	You're not a bitch.
What is wrong with you?	I don't know. I just didn't wanna win like this.
I hate her!	We all do. Now let's go.
What?	You heard me. Where is it?
If you're gettin' at somethin', you better just say it.	I just did.
If you want seconds, then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.	Bitch!
Here, I didn't get any.	Here, have some.
Here I am, Father.	Take a letter.
What's the matter with you?	What's the matter with you?
Hey you!!	All right -
Then it's war?	Yes.
Oh yes. You have so many nice things, and so much room.	Oh?
Did it go well, darling?	Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?
John loves the house.	Do you?
Yes.	And here are my mother and father.
Our man is sick. Come right away.	What is it?
What are you going to do?	I'll show you! I'll show you!
Don't!	Shut up!
What did you do to him? He's been like this all night!	What do you mean?
I like doing business with you. You and I understand each other, completely. I know I can trust you. Can't I?	Everything will be seen to.
I want my man back.	Just a moment, how did you get in here?
Oh yes?	And what was that, John?
Can you imagine what his life has been like?	Yes, I think I can.
How are you feeling today?	I feel much better. Thank you for asking. And you?
She's very pretty, your mother.	Yes.
Have you read it?	No, but I certainly shall.
Thank you very much.	Well, if there is nothing more, I suppose we'll be leaving you now.
Good evening. How are you feeling?	Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
Good morning, John.	Good morning.
My home.	There is one more thing, John. Here.
Stand up, John. Let them see you.	Oh no, I couldn't.
Goodnight John. Sleep well.	You too, my friend. Goodnight.
Won't come out, eh?	No, he's very upset about something.
Open up! I know you're in there!	Ah! It's my father!
Right! Where is he?	Who, Father?
It's all right! It isn't happening!	But, Father, it IS!
WHAT did you say?	I said welcome.
Please! Please! What are those?	What are what?
What's the matter?	PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
WHY?	Yes.
We mustn't let him land!	Who?
Just give me a hand.	I mean, you could have killed yourself.
No!	I'll bring it back.
No.	They didn't like it! Oh God! I want to die!
Careful!  They're not supposed to hurt you.	You've got to let me go!
I've come to take you back to the land of the living.	What a stupid idea.
Why should you care?	I don't know! I just did!
What are you talking about?	Come on, move it!
That's terrible!	You mean if just ONE PERSON gets killed?
He can have my place. I don't want to go anyway.	Well, you ARE!
Faster!	Make your mind up.
What did he say?	Look out!
You must help us.	We don't HAVE to help anybody.
There is another way.	Who gets killed?
Well, what else do we do?	How about making friends?
Hey, you two! What's going on?	I was sitting there.
How did he do that?	Do what?
Are you all right?	No, I'm not.
Help!	Help!
Shut up!	She knows it was our fault!
KILL! KILL!	Stop it!
Well I'M certainly not, either.	Neither am I.
Who was the girl you walked off with?	No one.
How are you today?	Okay, I guess.
Come over after I'm done here?	I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
What's wrong with me?	Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
How are you today?	Okay, I guess.
I'm sorry.	Why?
Really?	Well, I didn't want to assume.
I don't need nice. I don't need myself to be it and I don't need anyone else to be it at me.	Okay.
Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.	No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
You like that?	Very much.
God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.	I'm fine.
Ready for another?	No, I'm okay for now.
What do you want to hear?	You pick it.
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.	Yes.
How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?	You didn't say anything about my hair.
How can you watch this crap?	Where are you going?
Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?	I want to have a baby.
What?!	I don't want to talk about this here.
More?	No. Thanks.
What if you hide me?	What do you mean?
There's this guy!	What?
Right. Something black though.	I'll buy that. Black's always good.
I told her today I need to end it.	Is that what you want?
Hi there.	Hi.
I do sort of live with somebody though.	Oh.
Cool.	What are you doing?
So you'll call me, right?	Yeah.
Listen, did you want to make love?	Make love?
What took you so long?	I just walked in.
Yeah?	Did you send this? Is it a joke?
It's them.	It's too late.
I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later.	I didn't want to do this. But I had to or they would've called me a girl.
Okay. I wish you could come.	This is it. The night we met. My God, it's over.
Yours?	You take it. I don't know.
Hi.	Hi.
Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.	In a minute.
It's stopped.	What?
He's coming?	You better go.
Hey.	Do you swear you didn't know?
Oh.	Hi.
What's this?	Nothing.
I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.	I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
Does that help?	Yeah, that looks better. Thanks.
Yeah?	Just wanted to let you know.
Is everything getting worse?	Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.
How does she like what in bed?	Like what?
I can see why they sent you along.	So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?
Is that an offer?	It is not.
Do you hear it? Right there.	Hear what?
What's wrong?	Nothing. It's nothing.
What's wrong?	You didn't hear it? You must have heard it!
I found one.	Alive?
Yes.	One of my men is down. I want to know what happened to him.
What are you?	You know.
Thank you.	Captain, we got a problem.
Everybody okay?	We're all here.
If you knew it was impossible, then why'd you waste my time?	I thought you wanted an answer. And that's the only one I have.
No. I saw nothing.	I did.
You got any coffee?	It's cold.
What are you doing?	It wants me. I have to go.
I don't think She's real big on hate.	You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
We're going to have to work on your touch.	I like the sound of that.
He didn't.	Oh, he did.
What are you doing here?	I'm worried about you.
What did you wish for, honey?	I already got it. Everything I want.
I can't take this.	Ben. This is business. Just work.
What about his first born?	Ben, the money's not important. We could save lives.
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?	Five times.
How long was I out?	Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
We had a tough year.	Yeah, nine years straight.
You're hot!	So are you!
This is wrong in so many ways.	You've been working out.
Stop it.	Okay, "mom."
What is that thing?	I think that thing is Ben.
I'm driving.	Dude. That's my sister.
I, uh, think I remember the number.	It's been changed.
Feeling better?	Yes, thanks.
What?	We need to get past them.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?	That's what we're here to find out.
I mean, you broke up with me, right?	Are you kidding?
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?	Not at all.
Not until Ben is back inside!	It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
Go ahead. Just make it quick.	Totally.
Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?	They're not home yet.
You're not going to tell me, are you?	No.
Do you have any ice tea?	Sure. Come on in.
Listen. I feel pretty strange here. Because Mark really likes you, and he's my friend.	He's my friend, too.
Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike?	You first.
Hey, Mike?	What? Are you all right?
What's wrong?	I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
Oh. Hi.	I didn't see you this morning.
What's going on?	Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it.
How do you know it's mine? We only did it once.	I know it's yours.
Take that back.	All right, I take it back.
Okay. Tell me. What's the Five Point Plan?	All right. Pay attention.
Well, I've gotta be running.	Okay. See ya.
Poor guy.	Really.
Hey, slow down. This is my brother's car.	I thought he was out of town.
What the fuck is this guy doing?	This ain't no cop.
My brother is going to kill us. He's gonna kill you and then he's gonna kill me. He's gonna kill us.	Just be glad you're all right.
How's it going.	Do you think that guy's cute?
Don't you like him?	Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.
I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.	Believe it.
Was it great?	It was okay.
What do you think it is?	What do you think it is?
You know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys.	What?
I think I've made my point with you tonight.	Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
You look like you could still be in high school.	I know, everyone says that.
What can I get for you tonight.	How about your phone number?
It's very warm out tonight.	It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
I think I better take you home.	What about those other guys you live with?
Is this your first time?	Yes.
Thanks for coming to get me.	Sure thing.
This is a nice car.	Yeah. It's my sister's.
Do you have Mrs. George for English?	Yeah. She is pretty good.
Are you all right?	Oh yeah.
Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?	Not at all.
Where's your brother?	I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
Really?	Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
Thanks for the ride. Thanks a lot. I like you guys. Don't worry about me.	Wait a minute! Come back and have a beer!
Why?	Why what?
When does this thing stop?	It won't stop. It's not ever going to stop.
Don't run. They'd like any excuse to shoot us.	You drive! I think there's something wrong with me.
WELL? What are your plans?	Plans?
The airport is over there!	Never missed a plane yet.
Maybe she's telling the truth. Maybe she's not part of it.	No! I swear I'm not!
Could I have that, please?	Why not? It was getting warm anyway.
Oh Lord! I'd do just about anything for that!	You and a lot of other people.
Stop!	What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
YOU'RE KILLING HIM!	They'll get in! We'll all die!
I will not die because of him!	Don't be stupid, drop the gun!
Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!	They'll be back.
Where are you two going?	We're going to get my little girl.
IS IT CLEAR?!	Yeah.
Well, it don't look pretty.	But it's got teeth.
Oh!	"OH!?" WHAT IS "OH?" What does "oh" mean?
They're right here.	Hey!
You all sure about this?	Follow me.
I'm gonna shoot him if they don't get him first.	Just move!
Scared?	No. You?
So, what now? Did those things leave?	Why don't you go check it out?
We're better off.	Who's with me?
Come on!	He's dead.
I'm in.	Anyone else?
We're going to get help.	We gotta try.
We gotta be close.	What?
You wanna see, baby?	Sure.
What?	What?
They were all over the place.	You smell like ass!
Bullshit.	No bullshit.
Fine, Chief.	Gimme the keys.
What?!	Move slow and move quiet.
Shit!	I'm fine! I'm fine!
SHIT.	MOVE YOUR ASS!
Yeah, maybe.	Get something on that.
Nothin' will happen to you. You get on my back, hold on tight and we truck out of here together.	Am I too heavy for you?
What's wrong?	Nothing, just lookin'.
Let's go.	She's not very nice, is she?
DON'T!	YOU'LL HIT US!
Go! Go!	Not without you!!!
Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready.	All right.
You know you don't have to do this.	I'm fine, I really am.
We should stick together out there.	I'd love to.
Well, I suppose I should just say it. It's your clothes.	My clothes?
Good, good. Give them that.	What?
Okay, but come here first.	Huh.
Hey, where's the fire, sister?	In my eyes, officer.
Harry!	I gotta go now.
What do I do, Dad?	You really want to go?
I'm going back to the hotel.	Good.
Age?	Fifteen.
Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?	You think I'd miss it?
Serious, huh?	Yeah.
Take a walk, pal.	Who said I was a lady?
Oh my God, I look awful.	You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.
You know something, Harry?	I guess.
Why are you always leaving me, Harry?	Huh?
There's just one more thing.	What's that?
This is it, kid. This is our chance. When you got a chance, you better take it.	Yeah. I don't know.
I got a new car. Only it's red. Did you know Mama died?	Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.
It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?	I'm not sure.
Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you again.	Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way with you?
Yeah.	What'd you do?
Shit!	Run!
What happened? Who're you?	Who're you?
I'm not!	Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
How's it sound?	The speech? Real good.
I think I need a little air.	What's wrong?
How long will you be?	Not long.
I'll have lunch ready by one.	I'll be back.
Where are you going?	I'm going out!
Oh, just leave those things for now.	No, Mama, I'll take care of it. I'll wash them in the morning.
You were with him at the end.	Yes.
Nice.	The music? Or the fire?
Come warm yourself if you like.	You speak.
What can I do?	There is something I want.  A friend.
Soon?	Yes. I want this over and done with.
You will honor your promise to me!	I will not! Kill me now!
She's beautiful.	She's not for you.
Nothing. Still nothing.	It's been months. It's not like him.
Are you all right?	Fine.
Are you sure it can't hurt us?	Nothing can. Not ever.
I've loved you all my life	All my life I've known.
Brother and sister still?	I wish to be your husband.
I thought I'd never see you again!	I'm all right. I'm safe,
No. Not tomorrow, not next week, Marry me today.	Why the change? What about your work?
Brother and sister no more.	Now husband and wife.
Professor?	Oh God.
Only you would think of that!	Somebody has to!
Quite a place.	Thank you, Henry.
What happened up there?	I didn't find what I was looking for.
Are you sure you'll be all right?	Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her.
The killer is still out there.	I will protect you.
I think we should go wake them up. Just in case.	Give them a little while longer. It's still early, anyway.
How come you're leaving?	It's long and personal. It has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
What'll you do when you leave here?	I don't know.
Help you clean up?	Absolutely.
Where?	They're off now.
You said we were special.	I meant everything.
What the hell?	Where'd you get that stuff?
Give me a hand?	For sure.
You saved my life.	I had to.
What is it?	Is it stuck?
How many with you?	Just my son and I.
What was that?	Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
What's this guy's problem?	I have no idea.
Not a chance.	Come again?
Yes.	Good.  Your old man's all right, he just saved your life.
Who's this?	My wife.
Is this real?	Yes.
I'm telling you, don't hurt her.	As long as you're cool, she'll be cool. What're ya gonna say?
Then?	Then stop, 'cause that's where we're going.
Who else?	Pass.
To your family.	To yours.
Now, is your shit together?	Forever together.
About two hours from now.	So all we have to do is get by for a few more hours and then we can walk right out the front door.
I'm going for 'em!	No!
What?	Where are you taking us?
You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said?	Yes.
We have to go back for Daddy!	Daddy's dead.
I'm sorry.	Me too.
See ya.	Later.
Where's the woman?	What?
Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I am?	What?
Richard!	What?
This isn't gonna work.	Shut up. It's gonna work just fine,
You okay?	Yeah, I think so. What happened?
How?	Where are you right now?
Then good night.	So I'll get a fair shot?
Fine by me, sir!	No problem, sir!
Shit.  Think we're had.	Smoke her.
White House boys want a private meeting.	I'll act surprised.
Yes?	Did you hear?
They're more afraid of you.	Well, now I feel so much better.
Say again, sir?	You heard me.  Move on.
Simple question, lieutenant.  No reason not to answer.  What is your father's name?	"Dad."
Do you?	No.
Got it.	Show us where you are, Chief.
Clear.	North?
You mind?  I'm trying to eat here.	So am I.
Who the hell are all these people?	What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.
You okay?	It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this.
Animal, I can't.	Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance.
Don't you think we have enough?	Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough.
Think we can fit up in there?	Only one way to find out.
He's not going to do it.	Oh yes he will.
So you made it.	What?
Wait. I'm sorry. You're right. Eight years is a long time. Can I offer you a cup of tea?	Sure. I'd like that.
Is this cause of me? Because of the story?	Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?
Who was that French guy, anyway.	Oh, just some insurance guy.
It's Nick! I know that guy. I know him!	Who is he?
Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.	That's the problem. He did.
Not for a long time, now.	Well, I think you're cute.
I'm sorry about all this.	Me too.
Who are they? Lieutenant, get those people away from there.	They are with me!
Are you looking for this?	Thanks.
Do I know you?	We've met before.
How did you get all of this stuff into the country?	This is America. There is nothing you can not buy.
I think we should leave now.	Good idea.
What'd they say?	I can't get through. I don't know what's wrong.
Who the hell are you?	It's okay. I know her.
Go ahead!	You go first! There's no time!
What?  What?	Nothing.
I don't know.	Nobody was WATCHING?
You said "the Commander.	What?
Go. They're off again.	Up.
Guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay?	Oh, I'm not? I'm not? Then what's my last name?
They're gone.	Where'd they go? Back inside?
You're playing your good side.	Don't be ridiculous.
What?  What did he say?	Nothing. Hold please.
Where the hell is he?  An hour and a half late.  An hour and a half!	This is great!  They're going to start eating each other out there.
You gotta admit, they do love him.	Almost as much as he loves himself.
That's it, It's go time.	Don't do it, Tommy. He's not worth it.
I heard it too.	Is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?
Wait. What did you say?	Please, don't hurt them, it's not their fault. I'm not the Commander, I don't know anything.
Faster Tommy. Get us out of here!	It's as far as it goes!
Oh, right, sorry.	Okay, let's go.
NO NO NO.	We've got to get out of here.  C'mon, hurry
Well, George, who were you?	I?  You all know my history.
How old are you, Captain?	I'll be twenty next year, sir.
Not today.	I want you to see our hospital.
We can't take them.  Are you all right?	We're leaving them?
Well, this must be about something!	It is; we need you George.
He knew it was a set up. He was ready for it.	So where's the money?
You get the money?	No. What's this?
What, did you see it work in some movie you got beat up in?	I have to ask you for that key.
What's this movie you're doing first?	Harry, let me answer that.
But first I want to know who I'm talking to. Am I talking to you, or am I talking to him?	You can talk to me.
I really think I can be of service on this one.	Yeah, well, we need a ride somewhere, we'll let you know.
I need the money.	What money?
She's great. Gimme the money.	First you and me gotta get a couple things straight.
You broke in my house and I have a witness to it.	What?
I don't know.	It's not the kind of thing you do.
I can hear you, but where the fuck are you, man?	What I been wondering is where's he been.
What?	Look at me, Ray.
Jesus, if I have a heart attack, I hope you know what to do.	Where you been, Harry?
Did you stop to think what if I had a heart attack?	You look okay to me, Harry. Come over here and sit down. Tell me what you been up to.
I'm looking at you.	I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
You're not looking at me, Harry.	Why do I have to keep looking at you?
That's it? That's your movie?	I said I had an idea, that's all.
How's anyone gonna see anything from way up there?	Hey, Harry.
Really.	Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
So you don't know what I'm thinking.	No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
How about this?	That's not bad.
You've been losing.	I'm up twelve grand today.
The interest is four hundred and fifty dollars a week on fifteen thousand?	That's right. Three percent.
You been here the whole time?	I just caught the end.
That why you came over here, to ask me that?	I want to know.
Yeah?	Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
Were you scared up there?	You bet.
I'll be right back.	Go get your stuff.
I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.	You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
Well, aren't you gonna offer me whatever it is you taste like?	Come on in.
What's wrong?	Be quiet and listen.
What I'm saying, Harry, is I want you and your new buddy to get out of my house.	Oh, yeah, sure.
One more?	Why not.
What is your first name?	What?
Roger.	Roger?
You think that's funny	No.
Ready?	Bring it on, dude.
Guess I'll just keep working.	What're you crazy?
Maybe that is his boat.	Gimme a break.
Fifty million dollars. Fifty million. We gonna let this guy just take it from us? One guy?	So we kill him?
One guy isn't gonna be so stupid.	Maybe he isn't alone.
Did you?	Hell no. You think I'm crazy?
It's a hell of a lot of money.	What, you think there's something funny about it?
Or somebody stopped them.	Either way, they must've had a pretty good reason.
Can't you use something else?	I might be able to find something on the ship. But it's gonna take time.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?!	I don't know what you're talking about?
The radio!	The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio.
Yeah.	You better get down here right now! We're taking water! Big time!
You're late.	Sorry.
Then why didn't they take it.	Probably didn't have time.
Coffee.	You're a pal.
Stay away. Or else.	Because of the gold.
You okay?	Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
Coffee?	Yeah. Thanks.
Why not call for help?	For now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.
Take it easy, you'll live longer.	Did you see him?
How's he doing?	Same. Any luck?
It's not gonna hold us.	Doesn't matter.
Hey.	Hey.
She said the ship was evil. That we had to leave right away. That if we didn't, we might never leave.	What's that supposed to mean?
Why you? How come the rest of us haven't seen these people?	Just lucky I guess.
What do we do with him?	Leave him till we can get some help.  From now on, nobody comes down here.
What happened?	We hit land.
I been watching it for close to an hour and it hasn't moved. I can't raise it on the radio either. Makes me think it might be in trouble.	Alright. I'll be right up.
It's funny.	How's that?
Morning.	You're up late.
What now?	We could call for help.
I don't know.	Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
What happened?	You don't remember?
What about the gold?	Leave it.
Why do you even need a ride? You could walk there in two minutes.	It's just an excuse for us to spend time with you.
Jesus, look at this guy.	Oh my God, that's HIM!
Do you want something to drink?	Why?
Much later.	In fact, never.
Hi, Al!	Can we call you "Weird Al"?
You call.	Why do I always have to do it?
I want to "make love" to him.	I'm going to tell him you said that.
It's obviously him!	I can't believe it!
Are you sure?	Totally! Look!
Why are we going here? I hate this place.	It'll only take a second.
I totally, totally hate you.	Aw c'mon, this is a fun party.
Give me all your money, bitch!	Where did you get that?
That guy is totally amazing.	He does that every single day.
Hello?	Do you still want to do something tonight?
Hello?	I need to talk to you.
Didn't they tell you?	Tell me what?
Go die, asshole!	Get a job!
Thanks for the tape - I'll have to pay you later, I'm broke.	Hey, where are you going?
That's five hundred dollars.	What?
I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them?	Who knows?
What are you doing here?	I had to see you.
I agree.	I wish I could see him.
Did you remember to pay the phone bill?	Yeah.
I have to admit, things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit.	So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?
Thank you, doctor.	Don't thank me. You're doing all the work.
I am a man of peace.	Am I to take it you want to live?
Starting now, we attack them.	How; we don't know where they are?
You're certain about tomorrow?  But you don't seem excited. 	You don't enjoy killing, do you? 
What a good week.	You mean nobody died?
I didn't have a chance to thank you.	What did I do?
It's certainly the best chance they've had to kill you.	You think they'll come then?  Why?
You like him, don't you?	Oh yes. But it takes time.
No, you didn't, Frank.	Okay, that's no problem.
So this is what you do, huh?	Oh, hello, Peter.
Is this the spot?	A little to the left.  Right there!  That's where it stopped.
You're really good with children, Louis.  I can tell.  Why don't you come here and sit with me?	Okay.
Should we go?	I don't think we should leave her alone.
Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television.	How are you?  What's that you're working on, Johnny?
I'll let you get back to it.  Nice meeting you.	My pleasure.
You've got to do something!	Who are they?
These boys aren't playing around.	You've got to stop them.  Please!
That's it?  That's all you have to say?	Did I forget something?
Don't shoot!  You'll hit Ray!	Do it!  Just do it!
Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it.  Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish up and get out of here.	I'll get one more reading.
My Fault!	She's new in town.
Ready?	I'm ready.
Now that's one ugly dude.	Huh?  What?
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?	Wonder what?
Now where are you going?	To the bathroom, where do you think?
Is it a star?	It is a star!  That's great.  You're very good.
Okay.  Just give me a second here.  I have to leave now but if you've got some time I'd like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me.	Eight o'clock?
Why would anyone make up a thing like that?	Some people like the attention.  Some people are just crazy.
That's too bad.	What?
Uh-huh.	Well, let's check it out.
Damn!	Are you all right?
Do you want this body?	Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
Did you see it?  What was it?	We'll get back to you.
I want you to have this. 	What is it?
Nervous?	Yes.  I don't like this.
Something was definitely here.	Yeah, I can smell it.
Wait!  Wait!  There's something I forgot to tell you.	What?
All right.  I'll try.	I'll spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
Ray!  Where are you?  Are you all right?	God, it's ugly!
I told you it's real.	What do we do now?
It's here, Ray.  It's looking at me.	Don't move.  It won't hurt you.
You don't have to worry about that with us, sir.	Right.  We'll believe anything.
It's my brother's neck you want, not mine.	Yours will do!
General, do you realize what happened out there today?	I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
Hello.	Hello.
You're living at home now. Is that right?	Yes.
Do you always drive like this?	Yes.
Do you want some dinner?	I'd love some.
Aren't you eating?	No.
Could you do it?	No.
Will you take me home now?	I'm sorry I took you in there.
I want to go home.	But could I just tell you this one thing?
Where we going?	I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
What is the matter?	Nothing. I'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. I mean let's go see. Let's go see if they do or not.
Do you?	Yes.
I'm sorry. That is not my business.	It just happened. It was just this thing that happened along with everything else. Can you understand that?
Was she married or something?	Yes.
All right.	During the day? We'll go for a drive or something.
Why aren't you ready?	Because I want to know what's happening.
I'm meeting someone.	Ah. Where?
Is that him over there?	No.
I want to ask you a question.	Come in.
I said I think it is.	All right then! Yes!
Why?	Because it isn't true.
What are you going to do now?	I don't know.
Are you going home?	No.
I don't want you to leave tomorrow.	I don't understand.
You won't?	I don't know.
I just don't think it would work.	Why wouldn't it?
Are we getting married tomorrow?	No.
I'm putting it here by the door.	Will you bring it in to me?
Yes sir?	A room. I'd like a room, please.
Is anything wrong, sir?	What? No. Nothing.
Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?	It's down the hall.
Is it a girl?	Is what a girl?
You don't?	No. 
Thank you.	Right.
Will you come in, please?	What?
All right then.	What do you drink?
Drink?	No.
Are you always this much afraid of being alone?	Yes.
What do you think of me?	What do you mean?
Oh my God.	Pardon?
I think I'll go to bed.	Oh. Well, goodnight.
Thank you.	Right.
I really don't want to put this on again. Won't you bring it up?	Where is it?
Don't be nervous.	Get away from that door.
Yes, I do.	I've got to go.
May I sit down?	Of course.
How are you?	Very well. Thank you.
May I have a drink?	A drink? Of course.
Did you get us a room?	What?
I got a single room.	That's fine.
Thank you.	You're welcome.
How do you get out of the house?	I walk out.
What do you say to him?	He's asleep.
Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him.	No.
Why did you do that?	See if you can guess.
What kind of car was it?	What?
I wish you'd tell me.	There's nothing to tell.
I say I've got it.	Sir?
Can I talk to you a minute?	Sure.
I drive around.	What else?
But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me.	Goodnight.
When did you two talk this over?	We haven't.
Can you see me now?	Yes, I can.
I've quit.	You can't.
Never?	You're a fool!
He must be very nice.	Who?
We'll dance.	All right. We'll dance.
I'd given you up.	Sorry.
That was lovely.	Will you do me a big favor?
I'm worried about you.	Don't.
Thank you, sir.	Not at all, sir. 
That was my last.	You've lost everything?
Oh, let the poor devil alone.	I did not ask your advice.
Oh, I've got to find it.	Stay where you are.
You must look at my face and not at the floor.	Yes.
Can you pay some attention to me?	Oh, yes.
Come here. 	Here, hold up!
He will be on the train.	But when did he go? How do you know?
We will wait.	You are late. Hurry.
One question. Do you want to stick to that story, or do you want to keep your teeth?	I want to keep my teeth.
All right.	I'll get you a check.
What? Me?	That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?
Not as tough as you, huh?	No. And you have to be.
Lucky? You call that lucky?	He let me live. He let me be his friend.
I just give you your life. What you do with it is up to you.	That's right.
What's that?	Four grand. For the hospital. Is that enough?
Going somewhere?	Somewhere else, that's for sure.
You want a drink?	I don't think so. You probably shouldn't either.
Where's the five?	In your other hand.
Well, well. In a real hurry, are we?	Always, for you, baby.
Her job.	I want to know everything about you.
Get well soon.	Every day in every way.
No.	See you soon.
Think about it. Okay?	Sure.
Yeah?	Open your door.
What is it? What's going on?	I'm happy the way I am.
Oh, Jesus.	No question, huh?
That's that, then.	Oh, yeah. That's that.
That's it?	Care to join me?
Where are you going?	To the bathroom.  Can I do that alone or do you want to watch?
Shit, John!  What the hell were you doing out there?!	Nothing.
Where are you going?	I don't know.
He found you, didn't he?	Get on the bus.
Not me.	Why not?
What are you doing here?!	I came to see you.
You look kind of cold.	I'm okay.
Better?	Yeah.
Aren't they doing a terrific job this year?	Looks great.  It does.
It's John, isn't it?	It's always John.
Hey, you alright?	What?
Wait.	What is it?
Fuckin' A.	He gave me a fuckin' A?  Wow.
Let the party begin.	Have enough fun for the both of us.
What if your parents come home?	Then they can watch.
Aren't you gonna answer that?	Answer what?
God, what's wrong with him?	Here.  Let me try.
Where's the baby?!	He's gone.
Come on!	It's not working!
What is that?	It's a sign.  He's come home.
There you are.  Who was that boy?	An old friend.
No!!!	Stay away, Sam.
Who else knew I had the baby?!	No one.
Run, Tommy!!!  Run!!!	No!!!
Home.	You know what gets me?
You know what gets me?	Oh, shit.
You know what gets me?	Go home!
And how were things?	Let's talk about something else.
What's funny about that?	You know me, boy.
What an awful sound!	Get used to it.  Back door, Paul.
Fifty years?	You're making a joke.
Yes, wife, it is.  Come here, boy.  Your father is home.	Sir?
Dad?	Who was it?
Mom?	What's this?
What's this?	Nothing.
Then speak, by God!  Can you fight with words?	I don't want to fight you.
Can I help you, sir?	I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
What's the matter?	Give us time.
What's that all about?	We thought a doctor might help.
You know what I want?  I want you both to be friends.  I know you both, respect you both. You should be friends.	Nothing would please me more.
I'm so glad you like each other.  I was so scared, so scared.	Have some.
Awful.  I can't tell you how sorry I am.	Say hello to your mother.
He hasn't had breakfast yet.	Buy yourself breakfast.  There we go.
I'm going to call the police.	Don't!
This is suicide.  Go get the police.	Stop!
Give me that Goddamn thing!  Now get out of here, or I might kill you.  Who knows?	You've killed women?
No.  No.	Get up.
Dead!	Jesus.
So long, you guys.	What will you do, Colonel?
That goes double for me.	I don't want to live any more.
Don't touch me.	Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
I hate that thing.	It's beautiful.
Mom?	That man is your father.
Really?	It is an emergency, isn't it?
I didn't get his name.  A friend of your father?	He isn't any friend of Father.
Coming.	Women are always late.  You'll find out.
What then?	We could have had some kind of birthday party for him.  We could have taken Paul to the fight with us.
Did you see him?	Yeah.
This is very good for us.	It is?
Get out of here.	It's really that bad?
Do it!	Goodbye.
You've got to fight from time to time.	Not true.
We have this new club up here in Heaven.	Yes, we do.
You're not exactly the type we're looking for.	You mean I'm black?
Hello. You want some information?	Yeah.
Are you the star of this picture?	You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
Are you a private detective?	Something like that. How much do you make?
I thought you were going to bed?	I am.
No.	Huh?
You have anything to drink? You want to go out and get something?	I don't drink, but you can go out.
You're not a private detective either, are you?	No.
Why do you say that?	Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
Where is she?	I don't know.
I'm only human, you know.	Get out.
Where'd you hear that name?	I just heard. Who is he?
You want to go for coffee after we send the girls off?	No. Thanks anyway. I've got to get over to the office.
How's your business, Jake?	Pretty good.
Jake?	How did you find me?
Just do what I say. Don't ask.	What is going on?
Hey, stop, stop. I'll do anything you want. It's okay. I can dig it. You can do anything you want to me.	Where is she? Where is the girl?
This is from the movie I was talking about.	I don't know what you're talking about.
I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything.	Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
Hold it, mister.	What do you think of that? Or this?
You can fuck off, too.	You're taking a big chance.
Okay, lady. Out.	Hello.
Haven't we met before?	None of that, lady.
Eh, no. Thank you.	You're welcome.  Did you know him?
Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?	No, thank you. I have my car.
Do you dance?	What?
What do you think?	Oh. Eh, I like it.
Why do you say that?	Because they are all the same.
What happened?	Look.
Oh, my. We're too late.	Is he all right?
We'll come back in the morning.	What is that he's working on?
Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together.	But I don't play anything.
I think I see it.	Yes. It's almost there.
But they'll put me in jail.	Really. Just put it there, Harold.
I suppose you think this is very funny, Harold.	What?
I'm going to marry the woman I love.	Harold!
Oh, is this your father?	No. My uncle.
I don't think I'm getting through to Mother like I used to.	Does that worry you?
Harold?	Huh?
I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all?	No.  I'd have liked to.
Good idea of yours to come out here, Harold. It's a lovely spot.	Thank you, Uncle.
Stay where you are, Harold .	She took my head.
It's different for us.	We've always been here.
Oh, right. Daddy's died and gone to heaven, eh?	Yes!
She's done it.	She certainly has.
The box. I need the box.	The box? Like in your story? Like in his house?
Get out of the way.	Are you crazy?
I'm scared.	No. Don't let it. You've come this far.
But I didn't open it! I didn't!	Then why are you here?
But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours.	And what about you?
It's almost over!!	No. It's not.
Don't look! Turn around.	Is it bad?
I'm in way over my head, I know that much.	You're doing fine.
Thank you.	My job.
What took you so long?	C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
Keep her safe. No matter what. I'll deal with whatever's back there.	Alone?
Goodnight, then.	Goodnight.
Hit me.	What?
Christ!	What's the problem?
It's my lucky day.	Hi.
What's happening?	We're leaving.
Will you sign for the bed?	Sure.
Alright, let's give it another try.	Do you really need this bed, lady?
That your daughter?	Uh-huh.
Just in time.	Stay the fuck away from me.
Please. Get back into bed.	I have to speak to my father.
I bet you make your Daddy proud, don't you? Beautiful.	This isn't happening.
No.	One last time. Give me the box.
Come to Daddy.	This isn't happening.
There is going to BE a wedding?	Oh.  Oh yes.
Well?	I don't want to see the dress.
Help me.	Tell me who you are.
No. God no.	Believe me. It's me. It's really me.
You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't.	What do you want me to do.
You can't love him.	I don't.
You look terrible. Have you had an accident?	I was here this afternoon.
Maybe somebody changed the lock.	Like who?
How long since you were here?	The best part of ten years.
Where are you?	In here.
Well?	Why not?
What have you done?	I cut myself.
Is it deep?	I don't know, I haven't looked. You know me and blood.
Are you all right?	Just feeling a bit sick.
Are you all right?	Fine.
Oh baby.	Don't go upstairs.
Not much fun, is it?	What?
Is this your place ?	Do you care ?
What's going on?	We don't need a bed, do we?
First time for everything.	That's right.
Why don't you do the same?	Maybe I will.
You know, you're very beautiful.	Am I?
Oh Christ.	What's wrong?
Who brought me in here?	I won't be a moment.
You wouldn't believe me.	Try me.
Who's there?	Daddy?
Well I want you to see the house.	I'm not going to change my mind, Dad.
Great.	Well come over, will you? See the place?
Big house.	You like?
She doesn't even want to leave the house.	Really?
I have to talk to you.	Of course.
Poor Frank. He's better off dead.	I don't believe it.
Get the fuck out of here.	What's the problem?
Where are you going?	I have to get out.
I won't be able to stand.	So lie down.
You're not going?	Just upstairs.
I'm here.	I thought we'd lost you.
You know I do know the way home.	It's late.
I beg your pardon?	There ya go.  I beg your pardon?
Oh no?	Oh no.
Oh!	Are you alright ?
Are you busy after work ?	Just trying to get my apartment in order.
I'll come back later, huh?	Sure. Why not?
Do I know you?	I don't know.
Yeah.	But now I kind of like it.
What?	What do you mean, "what?"
Hey.	What the fuck is that?
What the fuck is that?	What?
I'm looking for a record for my daughter.  For her birthday.  "I Just Called To Say I Love You." Do you have it?	Oh yeah.  We got it.
Great.  Can I have it then?	No, you can't.
What?	Nothing.
I can't go to the club tonight, guys.	Why?
Who are you going to see?	Nobody.
Hey.  Didn't you steal that one already?	Can I help you?
Let's not.	I want a tape.
Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone.	You look upset.
Shit!	Hi.
So.  Where have you been staying for the last week?	I think you know that.
What?	What, what?
Hello.	It's me.
Are you still in love with me?	Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later.
I called and called but you were out.  I thought I'd be gone before you got back.	Is that the last of it?
I'm sure.	You still together?  Going all right?
Hello.	Hey, how ya doin'?
I'm sorry.	No, no.  When are you going home?
Look, are you coming or not?	Yes, of course.
Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.	Hi.
Let's go home.  Okay?	Okay.
C'mon.  I want to know.	Want to know what, exactly?
Hi.	Hi.  What are you doing?
Are you worried about tomorrow night?	Not really.
Are you going to talk to me, or shall I get my paper out?	I'm going to talk to you.
What are you going to talk to me about?	I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not.  To me.
Are you okay?	Yes.  You?
I'd like it if you could stay the night.	Oh, right.  Alright.
Would you like me to turn the lights out?  Or would you like them on?	God, you ask a lot of questions.
Which way are you going?	That way.  You?
Hi, Mom.	Everything all right?
She left.  She's gone.	What do you mean?  Where did she go?
I think you have more.	Well we don't.
How's your uncle?  I hardly ever see him anymore.	Fine.
Would you like more tea?	No thank you, I'm fine.
Do you play?	Yes.
Jesus Christ.	You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.
He tried to kill me last night.	Where?
No.	No one knows you're here?
You did kill those men.	Not all of them.
No.  So what now?  We just wait?	Yes.
Here, try this.  I suppose they're still making women the same as back then.	It's beautiful.
I don't know any of these.  I'll make a fool of myself.	Follow me.
Who are you?	That would be difficult to explain.
What's wrong?	I can't stand it.  Oh God, I can't stand it!
Get out.	No!
Forget it.	I'm just curious.
I don't believe him.	Why?
I did at that.	And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?
It is as you are.	No!
I'm your future husband, remember?	I have no future husband.
Oh please.  Another one.	What would you like?
That's wonderful.  Where did you ever learn it?	Far away.
We must talk.	Stay out of it.
Do not turn your back on me.	You are really going to force this, aren't you?
I want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff.	Figure she's with him?
Where!	I don't know.
He found us even there.	He always did.
Long time.	Not so long.
What's the point?	This isn't done.  Get up.
This your present address?	Yes.
Look, I don't know what the hell you're up to, but I think I've got a pretty good idea.	Do you?
You're one of William's kids, huh?	His only kid.
Morning Mr. North	Same.
I won't be more than ten minutes, I promise you.	Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.
Too hot?	No. It's strong.  But I like it that way.
Oh, she was here.	Where'd she go?
Well, she'll know some day.	That's all I ask. Oh, wait a minute.
Well, I got to get back. You can find your way out, can't you?	Oh, sure.  Well, thanks for everything.
What's this?	Get out of here, you!
How long is what?	You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
Then what does he want with you?	Now you got me.
Well, I'll tell you one thing, old man, she never looked at me the way she's looking at you.	I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
Ring that number, will you?	Come here. See if we can move it.
No, you don't! Walter!	What is it? Here!
Wait a minute!  Let go there!	Murder, uh?
Anything you want, Boss.	Beat it out and get hold of some guys.
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?	I think it is.
How much?	Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
She looks as though she's going to come to.	Give me a hand with her, will you?
Hold the phone!	I'll have it in a minute.
Where'd you get this?	I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
All right. Tell 'em to shoot to kill.	What?
Who is this man?	Throw him out, Frank.
That's a lie!!	I never saw him before!
Where's the old lady?	I'm telling you!
Any news?	Yeah. I was never so tired in my life.
Hiding him where?	Mother!
Mother!	That man there!
What good'll it do?	We'll get you out in ten minutes.
What's the idea?	Never mind! Just play dead.
Who? Me?	Who do you think!
Why not?	I couldn't work in the city. You see, I've got my family in the country.
What's your hurry?	We want to see you.
I never was.	Yes, you was. Make him talk.
I know a secret.	What's that?
Well go on then. You can't join if you can't answer.	I only know one.
Go and ask her if she wants to play.	Ask her yourself.
Can't we just see the end?	They've got the real thing outside.
It was great for me, how was it for you.	A bit too quick.
Taste it. Why don't you taste it?	You taste it.
When do you think you'll get leave again?	Not till Christmas, I don't suppose.
Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me.	The ideas you get in your head.
And where do you think you're going?	Out.
I want him. I want him so much. I'll kill myself if I can't have him.	There, there, my baby.
What did he say?	He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
I don't believe this is happening to me.	It's not. It's happening to me.
Is it peace in out time?	No, Mother! It's War! War!
Please yourself.  Let them go, if they want.	Grace!
I didn't mean it like that, Grace. Why does it always come out wrong?	I know you mean well.
Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.	Please don't kill us, please don't kill us.
Who's your Daddy!	Who's your Daddy!
What about the tree?	Oh yeah, the tree.
OK, whatever. Let's go get your brother's truck. Faster we get the truck, faster we get out of here.	OK.
Don't worry, I'll be right back.	Come on.
Christ, you scared the shit out of me.	Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
Thank you.	You're welcome.
I'd like to see that.	Nice.
Can I help you with something?	I was just wondering.
Keep the change and get yourself a new name.	Holy crap, thanks!
Come on, we need something like this. It could be the real deal. It's too far out of the way to come back to.	What's that?
I can't believe what I'm seeing.	I know, this is fucking nuts.
Almost there.	Jesus, you think she was really gonna cut you?
I like sleep.	Here he comes.
Fuck! We are fucked!	Turn that fucking radio off!
Go around him.	There's not enough room.
Well, I got some bad news and some bad news.	What?
Fine. I'll go straight.	What!
I hope to Christ she doesn't expect us to wear these things.	Whatever it is just do it. The more we play along the faster we'll get the hell out of here.
How much is a person supposed to stand?	Quiet.
How long is that gonna take?	He should be back in a couple hours.
Huh?	Grab Mary and come inside.
Yeah, Jerry, she said some pretty fucked shit to us.	When?
Thank you.	Yes, thank you. Thank you very much.
Come on sleeping beauty, time to go to work.	Sleeping.
What was that?	What? I didn't hear anything.
Jesus Christ.	I think I'm gonna have a fucking heart attack.
What'd ya got there?	Keys.
Just back up.	I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right?
I'll go. It's my fault.	You said it, not me.
God damn it, I must be fucking crazy to let him go off with that crazy fucking bitch.	Huh?
Where is he?	Let's go see.
Over.	We found one.
What is wrong, my darling?	Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world.
My little French.	Stop. Get away.
Call you back.  You bastard! What do you want?	I just want to talk.
Well?	God, you're beautiful.
Yes, please, somebody ask him what is wrong.	I don't know.
I'm going alone. This could be dangerous.	Okay, my sweet. Good night.
Very well.	Very well.
You what?	I want to be the way I was before.
Done!	Ready!
I'll be in touch.	No you won't. But it's okay. You have stuff you gotta do.
What are you doing in there?	I'll be out in a minute.
Do you? Oh do you, darling?	Why certainly!
Did you see that?	What?
What are you doing in there?	Nothing. Be right out.
I think he's ready.	Oh boy!
Wait!	Yes?
Hey, another one for me and another one for the lady.	Check!
Give me a bottle of beer.	Right.
I'm ready.	Soon as I finish my coffee.
I want to talk to you.	Do we need words?
I'll make it up to you.	How?
Are you ready for another?	Thank you.
In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it?	It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money.
Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?	That's the way it's done.
We'll be there.	Good, good.
How much?	Oh, about five hundred.
Okay?	Sit down.
Make it twenty.	Cut.
Maybe by that time you'll die of old age. How much do you think you'll, uh, need?	A thousand.
Hello, Eddie.	Hi. How's business?
So does Eddie.	Well, I win sometimes.
What's the matter? What happened?	It's all right. She had a little too much to drink, that's all. Forget it.  Go upstairs and sleep it off.
How do we stand?	'Bout even.
I can beat him.	All right. Five hundred.
I'll beat him the next game.	How're the hands?
Please don't get off me now.	I know when to quit. You don't. Win or lose, you don't know when to quit.
I wanna walk.	It's a long walk.
How do you feel?	Fast and loose, man.
Quit. He's too good.	Charlie, I'm gonna take him.
Is this all we got left?	If that's all you got, that's all we got left.
Oh, I don't want to be no bother to nobody.	Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
With what?	Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.
Just like that?	Yeah. Just like that.
No, no more for me.	Well, hello. Haven't seen you in a long time.
You gentlemen care for a drink?	No, none for me. Come on, let's play.
Hi.	Hi.
Long wait for a bus?	Yes.
How long you been waiting?	What?
What time does the bus leave?	What bus?
That wouldn't give us much time, would it?	Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't.
Have a nice trip.	Thanks. I will.
Have a nice trip?	Fair.
Why did you do that?	I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
You were asleep when I left. I didn't want to wake you. Did you go out?	Yeah, I went out for a couple of hours.
Well, I believe you when you say you go to school.	You want to go with me?
Do you want me to go?	No, stick around.  Can I get you something? Drink? Coffee?
You going out?	Yeah. For a little while.
What are you writing?	Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.
Give it to me.	What's this supposed to mean?
Who is it?	Me. It's Eddie.
You can read it, if you want to.  You want to go out for a while? To a movie?	You wanna drink?
You glad?	Yes, I'm glad.
Well, what's so funny?	Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.
What is it, Eddie?	Nothin'.  Want another drink?
No, I want to walk.	Come here. Come on, now.
Don't you want to know where I'm going?	No.  Yes, I want to know what for. But I don't want to ask.
If you don't mind I think I'll stay at the hotel.	Well, what's the matter?
Go on back to the hotel.	Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
Your shot.	You miss?  Well, you don't leave much when you miss, do you, fat man?
Are you all right?	Yes.
Who is this?	My wife.
Do you remember where it is?	What?
You want to find them.	Yes.
Why don't you start with me?	You're not them.
What do you want?	What do you mean?
Mine.	Have you always had it?
You want me to stay?	Yes.
Do you still want me to stay?	Yes.
You have to go.  He'll never stop. Leave this place.  Find another.	I'll go.  We'll both go.  Far away.
I remember the first time we met. Do you remember that?	Yes.
Need some gas?	Please.
Hell of a night.	You got that right.
Bathroom?	Round back.
We're going to be moving, son.	Do we have to?
Well, son?  Should we call it a night?  I for one have had a long day.	Okay.
I had an awful dream.	What, Jim, what?
Better get some sleep, son, or you'll be pretty tired at school tomorrow.	Good night.
What did he talk to you about?	He was upset with moving, I believe.
This is a new town for you.  Do you like it here?	No.
That's quite a story.  You know that, don't you?	Yes.
I swear it was here.	But it's not, Jimmy.
Stay here.  I'm going to make a phone call.	Who are you calling?
No one comes here after dark.	Hide the car.
Damn.	I know a way.
Hi.  Sorry I'm late.	The back door was open.
Mom.  I gotta talk to you.	What?
What do you want?	You have to leave the White House.
What do you want me to do?	I want you to leave with us. Right now.
Just my luck, no ice.	I take it you've heard.
You still believe in him.	He's a good man.
Are you all right?	Did it work?
We're losing them.	Then get them out of there.
There's good news and bad news.	What's the bad news?
Tell her to get the kids and leave town.	What happened?
Perfect, she's using it.	It's perfect the line is busy?
David, David! What the hell are you doing!?	I'm making a mess.
What the hell are you doing?	Just getting a feel for her.
Nice meeting you.	You as well.
We're loose!	Doesn't matter. Game's over.
How're we doing?	Better than we thought.
Wait. I have to tell you something.	What?
Before we do this, I want you to know I'm sorry.	Sorry for what?
I shouldn't have left her.	Don't worry, big guy. I'm sure she got out of here before it happened.
Damn it!	I didn't even see them fire!
But I gave you some this morning.	I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore.
They let you out?	Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
We're leaving, don't try and stop us.	You're not going anywhere. You hear me? I'm still your father.
What the hell's going on?	We're leaving.
Mr. President, a real pleasure. They don't let us out much, you know.	Yes.
Yes.	Papers, sir. Got it here.
You know how long I've been looking for that?!	All your life.
What has the old fool got himself into now?	I don't know. But whatever it is, he's in over his head!
What about you?	I'm going after Dad.
Look what you did!	It's war.
I'm through!	We're through!
I said go around!	You said go between them!
My room!	Mine, too.
What are you going to do?	Don't know. Think of something.
This one. I think he's in here.	How do you know?
How did you get here?	Where is it? I want it.
Dad!	Out!
No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.	Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
Found it.	He was actually there? You saw him?
No! Don't Shoot!	Don't worry. He won't.
Dad!	What?
Come on, Dad. Come on!	What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
Stop!	What?
Dad, are we hit?!	More or less.  Son, I'm sorry. They got us.
Those people are trying to kill us!	I know, Dad!
Ready?	Ready.
All right! Where's my father	If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
I believe we're being called to dinner.	Finally!
Come one, what's wrong?	Behind you!
What'd he say?	He told me they knew I was coming here.
And then they took their children.	Their children?
What's happening?	It's starting to let go!
I'd like to find one of those myself.	Oh really?
Couldn't keep away, huh?	Just try and control yourself.
Let's go! Let's get out of here!	Quiet!
What?	You've got to go to sleep now.
What're we going to do?!	There's got to be another way out.
I can't!	Go!
I get it!	You got it!
I said something.	I know you did!
No, not her. Me.	Who's you?
My name is AL.	Al ???!!!
Al.	Yes?
Somebody's been here.	Where are we now?
Who are you?	Who am I?
Look! I didn't ask to be in you. Don't blame me for it. You did it.	Me? What'd I do?
What was that?	Who was that? Somebody out there?
No they won't.	Why not?
What'd he look like?	He's not the problem. It's the van in the back.
Did you hear that?	Yeah.  Al wants to talk to you!
It can't take that long.	Why?
JOE Or what?	I don't know. I don't want to find out.
Ever think of what they might have to do to find me?	Find You?
I don't like the sound of that.	We have to get out of here.
Now what.	Go out, take your first left.
Which way do I go?	What does it say.
I'm back.	I'm at the airport.
What do we do?	Send a man there. A secret agent.
What about money?	What about it?
Now what?	The beach.
Holy shit!	What is it?
Take it easy, now. Don't want you in over your head.	Little late for that.
Now lie down somewhere quiet and rest, I'll be back in a while.	Where are you going? Wait!
Al, are you doing anything in there?	What? What do you mean?
Beautiful!	What was?
This must be business, there's nothing else here.	Follow it.
Help me out, will you?	What can I do? You're on your own.
What do I do?	Don't just stand there, say something.
.	.
Wait.	Wait.
Where is she staying?	Where are you staying?
Touch her.	What?
Now, where would I be?	What are you looking at?
Much too blue.	Not blue enough.
Mind your own business.	It is my business. It's my name.
Which one is she?	The beautiful one.
They both look good to me.	You have no taste.
Get close to them.	That place. By the window.
You're not just after this girl, are you?	Who, me?
I feel like an idiot.	Just hold them close and stay still.
Just don't show fear.	I don't know what's going on.
They're all in it.	How do you know?
What Happened?	I don't know!
And on my time.	It's not your time. I get time off.
You been had. We have.	It wasn't like that.
Some agent you are.	Why don't you get out of my face.
What do I do?	Follow her.
Come on, she's getting away.	I can't keep up.
Don't touch a thing.	Don't worry!
What next!	Drink lots of water.
Door to the right. Get up and run.	I can't see a thing.
What?	Never mind, just say it.
It's him.	Come on.
You sure this will work?	Not sure at all.
Do it.	I can't handle that thing.
Are you alright?	Just fine. I'll do the driving from now on.
There's a lot you don't know.	And don't let her know, either.
This may hurt.	Well, don't let it. What are you doing?
Do something.	What exactly?
Be quiet.	Where've you been?
She is beautiful.	You've changed your mind.
You're a lucky man.	Yeah, sure.
Not that truth!	Aren't we all.
Doesn't matter.	What part what?
I've seen that before. Never had anyone actually do it.	Do what? What'd you do?
What is your name?	Don't give her your name.
No!	Oh, I can't.
Can you fly this?	Don't worry.
You didn't tell us you were coming?	Then how did you know?
What Job?	Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
Who is your friend?	We met on the beach.
Well, I'm glad to see you. Sorry things broke up like that.	It's just money.
Joe.	What?
I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.	Of course you're not. We'll take good care of you.
And you, there are many places to get away. Why here?	A little voice in my head.
Don't do it!	Just give me the keys.
Now you know what I know.	Sir?
Is someone else here?	No. No one to speak of.
I'll be right there.	Where?
I can't do that?	Do what?
You mean from it.	Yes, of course.
You again.	Me still. They left you alone?
Promise you what?	That you're not crazy.
Joe! What happened to you?	Why'd you run off?
Why did you leave?	They left. I had to go with them.
Why did you stay with me?	Wanted to get to know you.
You're leaving.	Food doesn't agree with me.
You know where he went?	What's he done?
You don't believe me.	Oh sure.
Now what?	We figure out if it's in here.
What?	I said just relax. I'm in full control.
So do I.	This going to work?
Why not?	Can you?
What happened?	I can't fly it.
What a mess.	You can say that again. What do we do?
What?	They can hold us here forever. Nobody knows about us.
I'm sorry I got you into this.	It was my choice.
Don't blame yourself, I didn't have to come along.	Why did you, then?
How?	What?
Now what?	I've never met anyone like you.
Don't worry.	Why not, what are you going to do?
Just like that?	I'll come back for you.
Kiss her you fool.	Her?
Who are you? Who do you work for?	Doesn't matter. I'm on your side.
He can't help us.	Do something!
Come on.	That's twenty feet high.
What is it?	We're not moving fast enough for him.
I can't. He didn't do anything. Thanks to you.	Why are you on to him?
Wait.	Why?
It's alright.	It is?
Right there.	Thank you.
What'd he say, how's he know about Al?	What does he know?
Hi, honey.	Hi, Daddy.
Hey, baby. What's wrong?	What's that outside, Daddy?
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?	You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
Are you all right?	Yeah. Catch you later.
What does that do?	What do you mean, what's it do?
Hi, baby.	Catch you later.
I can take her.	Don't you have to be at the office?
Thank you, Bob.	Who's calling?
Yes, I'm right here. Could you call me back on a hard line?	Alright.
Oh, man.	Who are these people?
The new place? New.	You okay?
You believe that?	No.
What about now?	What?
I'm happy for you, pal.	Thanks, buddy.
My God.	What?
Well. He said to "make the house mine."	Oh boy. If he only knew.
Hello?	Miles?
Is that you?	Me. Yes.
Friends?	Don't go. Stay with me for a while.
I don't have a ring!	I know.
You don't like me?	I love you. I want to have your baby.
STUFF.  Got a light?	What kind of "stuff?"
Wait! He works for YOU?	Now. But first, he worked for you.
Sweet.	I thought so.
Who's that?	Jesus.
Maybe.	We do have a man for you.
Wait. I know you.	Yes?
What do you think?	What are they?
What's this about not eating?	I don't want to eat!  And there's one more thing I don't want! Definitely! That's to see you.
Where are you taking me?	South America.
A time will come when you'll thank me for this.	I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious.  Where'd you meet him?	On the road.
No, thanks. We're not hungry.	Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry.
What do you think you're doing!	Huh?
Tell that man not to drive so fast. 	Are you talking to me?
Do you mind putting out the light?	Not at all. 
Oh, so now I was drunk!	Well, you were!
This looks like the best spot.	We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
What's the matter?	Oh, Peter
Sure.	What?
Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two.	When you get up to a hundred, wake me up.
I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.	Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
What're you going to do?	Mind your own business.
Thank you.  Am I going to see you in New York?	Nope.
Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love?	Me?
Better go back to your bed.	I love you.
I hope you got your money.	You bet I did.
Maybe I could jump out of the window.  Do you think they'd see me?	Come here, you little fool!
Where's the bus to New York?	Left twenty minutes ago.
Eight o'clock tonight.	Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
I've been thinking about you.	Yes?
Funny couple, ain't they?	Yeah.
I told you! I told you, you couldn't trust him! He's gone!	Who?
See that. They're gone!	Looks like it, don't it?  Here's the woman, ma.
Not a minute!	Better start gettin' into your clothes.
Well, you're two up on me now. 	Hey, you!
Huh?	There's a seat over there for you.
Lucky thing, my running into you. Just the man I need.	You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
Did he pay you for this?	Twenty dollars each time.  Hell, it's no secret.  That's what I'm here for.
All right, all right.  Break it up.	Where you going, boss?
He asked me why I thought I was in danger and I said:	Well if they can kill the President, they can certainly get me.
I'm sorry.	I know.
Hi.	Tough day.
Did they live?	It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
They killed him, honey.	Huh?
Time?	Between six and seven seconds.
Here's my problem, Jack.  You told me you and Guy were good friends for a long time?	More than ten years.
How much more?	I don't know if I should talk about this.
No, she could get hurt.  If you believe what's happening to these other people.	She's the best damn witness we have!
Can I help you?	Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye on.
I understand.	Then say "Yes, Max. I understand."
I'd say there's about, oh, fifty thousand dollars here. What would you say Ray?	That looks like fifty thousand dollars from here.
What's going on?	She wants to make a deal.
Can I have a word with you?	Sure.
Help yourself.	While you're at it, let me see what else is in there. You mind?
You don't want much, do you?	Can you do it or not?
How was your flight?	Fine.
Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.	What's her name?
You're not tired of it?	I am, as a matter of fact.
If you're having some.	I am. Have a seat.
Thanks, but I have my own now.	You went out this morning and bought a gun?
What, I couldn't hear you?	You went out this morning and bought a gun.
Want to hear some music?	Sure.
I couldn't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair.	It looks nice.
This is pretty.	Uh-huh.
How do you get it out?	Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work.
How do you feel about getting old?	You're not old. You look great.
Well, hello.	Surprise.
What're you, a bag lady?	I go back to work tomorrow.
I didn't use you, Max.	I didn't say you did.
I'd feel a whole lot better if you took some more money.	You'll get over that.
Wanna go?	Thanks, but you have a good time.
He say we like the same thing as married.	Do you live together?
Most of the times.	Not every day?
Sometimes every day, for a while.	Then you don't see him for a few days?
Yes'm.	You know what's in the bag you're taking?
We'll just be a minute.	Can I smoke?
Oh, so now you know him?	You never asked me if I did or not.
I thought I did.	You didn't. I would think with all this on your mind, you'd wait till after.
Oh, hi.	Buy ya a beer?
For what?	Who you think got your ass outta jail?
The same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.	Hey, you get caught with blow, that's your business.
Yeah?	I didn't tell 'em anything.
What the hell you doin'?	Shut your ass up and grab the wall!
I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.	Talk to you tomorrow.
You told them that?	It's true, isn't it?
Drink?	I need to talk to you alone.
Want a hit?	Sure.
When did you get out of jail?	Four days ago.
Is it ready to go?	Yeah, there's another hit left.
Wanna fuck?	Sure.
Yeah, that really hit the spot.	Now that's over, let's get to know each other.
Is it dead?	Yeah.
He killed a man worked for him the other night.	So what are you trying to tell me? I should get out of here?
That's not what I'm saying at all.  You know where he went?	No.
Please.	You live with him.
We're leaving now!	All right already.
What are you doin'?	I'm getting out of here. What do you think?
Thanks, Baby.	Who's your partner?
I'm going to wait in the car.	Sure.  We almost done, ain't we?
Take the keys, man. Listen to music.	Which one is for the car?
It's Louis.	Did you get it?
Louis?	What?
What'd you shoot her with?	It's in there.
Jesus Christ.	What?
I'm going out for a few hours.	Hold on a minute.  Where you going?
It's in my bag.	You have cash. What do you need me for?
Getting there.	You go wait in the car. Wait a minute.
Hey, Max.	Yes.
Somebody already did.	What?
Where is it?	Is that what I think it is?
It's the next street.	I know where it is.
My money's in that office, right?	Uh-huh.
Get that for me, will ya baby?	You know it's for you.
Hope you don't mind keeping him company.	No problem.
He ain't here right now.	He leave town?
Get me out of here.	Where do you want to go?
Remember?	No! That was years ago! I've lived years since then.
Dream on!	No! Oh God.
Too late. I've tried. I think you're right, Jake. I'm game.	Me, too.
Daddy!	Oh God!
You know, you got a strange line here.	It's short, huh?
You mind? I'm eating, huh?	Something's going on here. You're not telling me something. What the hell's gotten into you?
What'd he say that for? What made him say that? Strange, huh? Strange.	What else did he say, Jake?
Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.	How do you know?
Ah, good. Now turn to your left.	She talk about the boys?
Loves me!? She hasn't said a kind word about me in years!	Right. She doesn't stop talking about you. You're always on her mind. That's love, Jake.
Half an hour from now and you'll be walking out of here all by yourself. Mark my words.  Well, you've done it to yourself this time, haven't you?	Am I dead, Louis?  Am I dead?
Perfect. We got it.  Okay. Let's just give it a little try. See if you can stand.	What? By myself?
What are you doing?	There's something I've gotta take care of, Louis.
I'm not dead. I am not dead.	No. Of course you're not. You've just hurt your back. That's all. You're going to be fine. It'll just take some time.
They stole it.	Who did?
I don't have to ask if you can feel that.	Goddamn it. I want Louis.
That help?	Thanks.
What do you think?	What do you mean?
Wait. Don't.	I don't like things that make you cry.
Jake!	How's it going?
I'm going home.	What's wrong?
You okay?	I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
Can't you stop it?	If I could stop it, I'd stop it.
What's it say? A hundred and two?	I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.
What does it say?	It's gone to the top.
What the hell are you doin'?	Get your clothes off.
He's coming right over.	Coming here?
I can't do it.	What kind of man are you?
Don't gimme that.	Lie down!
Help me! Help me!	Here. I'll do it.
Jake.  You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine.	Am I home?
Why are you doing this to me? You can't just go away like that.	I can do anything I want.
Don't!	It might be for me.
This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever since I was a little girl. I never thought it would happen.	Stick with me, kid.
WHO ARE YOU?	How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
Why won't you answer me?	Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
WHO ARE YOU?	How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
I can't move.	Just relax.
No. I'll take the other one.  Right. Well it's good to have you back. See you tomorrow, probably.	If you're lucky.
Clear the area. This is an order!	What is wrong with you?
Dream on!	What?!
Well, don't we look better this morning? That was a hard night, wasn't it?	Where am I?
This is not a dream! This is my life.	Of course it is. What else could it be?
Still married, Jake?	Nope.
That's as straight as I can put it. And don't tell me that I'm crazy 'cause I know I'm not. I'm goin' to Hell. They're comin' after me.	Who is?
It's okay, Paul. It's okay.	I don't know what to do.
Do you want me to get someone?	No. No. It's okay. I'm okay.
I have some ice from the machine.	Bring it in.
Asshole that does not count as a kill.	Yes it does.
Okay, enough of this shit.	Alright, asshole.
Goodbye old friend.	Okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
His mother?	What?
Where the hell were you?!!	He came for me, I had to run!
Better let me.	Where'd you get the gun?
Everyone okay?	I think I broke my arm.
We're not supposed to do that.	What are you gonna do, tell me?
Done!	Let's move out!
How many?	Bring 'em all. Let's move!
Then what do we do?!	I don't know!
Hurry!	Faster! Don't we have another gun?
It bought us some time.	And now we're all out of it.
What the hell are you doing?	My job.
Yeah, I got ya. I don't see anything inside though.	You just keep an eye out.
I'm with you kid.	Where is he?
I need to know what you know about this guy.	Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it.
Jesus, God!	Oh man, what the hell happened?
Where are you going?	We have to get off this ship.
Don't just stand there! Shoot him!	No you don't!
What if you miss?	What if we don't?
I couldn't save them.	Well, we'd be dead without you. You know that, don't you?
See? We're not so bad.	Not so bad.
Got it.  You ever space walked?	Oh sure, all the time.
It's time.	What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
Well?	She needs a little time.
Shut up! She just wants this thing dead!	No shit. I got no problem with that.
I feel better. Now how do you fire this damn thing?	Just go! I've a feeling he's right behind us!
It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up!	I'm on my way.
Okay?!!	Just come on, I've got an idea.
Oh, shit. He's going to see us.	Well, do something!
They're not gonna make it. Close the door before he gets us all.	They'll make it.
Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . .	Just get us to the ship!
You think it killed . . .  Yeah, I guess not.	Let's just get out of here.
Hurry! She's lost it!	So what else is new?
I didn't say I was good at it.	Oh shit! There he is!
It's just you and me, then.	Come here, might as well fix that arm.
Yo, Teach, what the fuck?	We're missing two of the kids!
Leave him behind!	No! He's coming with us!
How do you know?	I just know.
Something's wrong.	Keep trying!
Damn!  Close the door! I'll be right back.	What?!!
You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?	We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found.
You're not going anywhere.	You wanna die?
What good will that do?	They can deal with this sort of thing.
How do you open the damn door?	You're crazy!
Can we get through these?	Sure but what good will that do?
Guys, he's right behind us!	It's okay.
Did you bring a check?	What?
I never saw one that big.	What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?
Right.	Do you see the kids?
Love ya.	Hey Chief. Bring my cup back.
It's three feet deep, Martin	Michael! Come inside!
What happened?	I want to check something. Hold my feet.
Don't shoot him any more! He's crazy on his own blood already!	I can't stand here doing nothing!
We're not even sure what it was.	What else could've done that?
One more after this, then I'm going home.	Set?
You do this all the time, right, Charlie?	Twenty years.
Over there!	What do you see?
I'll drink to your leg.	And I'll drink to yours.
Follow him!	He's under!
Oh, I couldn't copy your work.	But you copy my work every week.
Wait, let me take that.	Huh?
No.	Cool. Well, let's sit down and get to know each other a bit.
Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?	The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.
Cool.	Come on, I have something for you.
What?	I actually know this one.
Oh, okay. Like this.	You've never been to a dance, have you?
No.	No?
Hi. I'm here for the big show?	Your name, please?
I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.	I have no idea what kind of girl I am.
You don't say.	Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?
What would be a good time for you?	I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.
We're actually, finally doing this?	Looks like it, yeah.
You lose!	I suppose anything's possible.
I told you how Early feels 'bout a woman drinking.	How'd you meet Early?
I'm cool.	Could I try that?
You took this picture?	Took 'em all.
That's me.	No it is not!
Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready.	I heard that.
Yeah but, what is it?	I don't know, they didn't speak too good English.
What's wrong with her?	She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen.
Tight fit.	Best kind.
Can't hurt.	How much do I owe you?
Sure.	Ain't you goin' to record it?
Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.	The party?
Hey. I didn't have the heart to wake you.	Thanks. What are you doing?
I like that.	I still think we should have met them first.
All set?	Fuck!
What is it?	Look again!
You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you.	I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
What about you?	I don't know.
What happened?	Who are you?
Shit.	Was up bitch?
What do you think?	You fucked it?
Well, how was it?	Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.
You know what else?	What?
And I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this girl is a baby.	Yeah.
Shit.	What do you want?
You wanna go to Paul's house?	What for? That guys a dick.
Man, this guy is really good.	He looks like my uncle.
I don't understand why you do that.	Why I do what?
So really, it's good luck.	Good luck?
How much you gonna take?	I don't know. How much do you want?
About ten. Fifteen is good.	Fifteen for me.
Yo, you think we killed that guy?	Na.
I don't know. I just never seen girls that did that shit before. But I think it looks nice.	Yeah. Do it again.
Hey.	Hey. What are you doin' right now?
You know I've been thinking about you lately.	You have?
I was lookin' for you all day today.	You were?
I don't even want to talk, but I gotta tell you that when I first saw you last week, I, I couldn't stop thinking about you. You've been stuck in my head.	Come on.
I'm nervous.	Trust me. Don't be nervous.
I like you so much. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't believe it.	How do you know?
Nothing. I'm telling you I just want to make you happy. That's all. Just trust me.	I don't want you to hurt me.
You know what I want to do?	Yeah.
Dance!	What?
No. I'm OK. Thanks.	You're OK?
Wish me luck.	Good luck.
I'm coming.	No. I just gotta go find him.
Just a lot of crazy shit.	Yeah?
Sorry. Dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job.	But then I won't need your money.
What are you guys doing?	Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
So, how many people live here now?	I don't know, eight or nine.
Yeah. And it takes them either too long or too short to come. Have you ever had someone that took forever	To come?
By yourself?	Yes.
We seem to have a little problem here?	What kind of problem?
Are you crazy?	Let's see how much he wants to play.
We didn't ask for your opinion, Doctor.	Maybe you should.
You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it.  You think I'm right?	I wouldn't know.
He's not talking about himself.	Then what's he talking about?
Yes you are.	Get off me!
Sorry.	Anything?
A few people.	Did anyone stand out?
It doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.	But a hundred men could move him.
Don't fuck with us!  Where did you go!	He was with me?
Hello, Peter.	Who is this?
Hello, Peter.	Just a second.  Hello?
I did another one last night.  You might have saved her, but you didn't want to play.	Where is she?
I suppose you want to know where I'm going to kill tonight, Peter?	You're not going to tell me that.
Hello?	Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.
I'm sure there are other people who would be interested in what I have to say.	Then call them!
Have you any idea what the message is?	If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
I know where you are.	Very good.  How did you know?
What's this?	Oh, I put a few games on for your daughter.  I hope you don't mind.
It worked out alright, didn't it?	Fuck off!
Feeling better?	I just can't believe it.
Why did he?	Why did he what?
Do you like my dad?	Of course.
I know he really likes you.	How do you know that?  Did he say something?
Okay.  Nice meeting you.	Nice meeting you.
What is it, dad?	Nothing.
Don't you have something you want to say to David?	Thanks, David.
You ready?	For what?
Same as the others?	Yeah.
Well?	Well what?  I told you this was a stupid idea.  You can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
I'm busy right now.	It's important.
No.  I told him to.  I wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end.	But we heard him.
You want me to go with you?  Maybe I can help.	That's alright.  We'll take it from here.
Where were you last night?	Are we going to go through this again?
Don't you understand what I'm telling you?  That's why he wants me out of the way.	I understand that this is just another one of your games.
You have something you want to say?	Just thought you might want to talk.
Sorry.  I thought it was empty.	It's alright.
Is this your first time here?	Yes.
I love this hotel.  I stay here every time I visit my parents.	How come you don't stay with them?
Well, I think I've had enough.	Getting too hot in here for you?
You sure you don't want to eat something?	I don't think I could.
It's going to be a long night.  It could take hours before we know something.  You should try to eat.	You sound like my mother.
I think it's interesting.	Another kind of game?
No.	You're not?
Relax.	How the hell can I relax after seeing what I just saw.
I know you didn't	You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
I just don't want to fight with you.	Then show me who you are.
I'm hungry.	Call room service.
Fine.	What do you want on it?
Did you call?	The line was busy.  I'll try again.
Hi.	Can I come in?
If we could just figure out what the next word is going to be.  He said the game's going to end tonight so there's only going to be one more word.	It could be anything.
You're right.  The killer told me.	He didn't tell you either.
This isn't going to be like the phone book, is it?	Of course not.
You beat him.	I got lucky.
It's over now.	I just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future.
I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.	I don't have to go through with it either.
That's a better one.	Yes.
You will go alone.	I won't leave you here.
I can't reach her.	What do you see?
From here, I must go alone.	You will tell me her name and we will go together.
It is today?	Yes. It is today.
Once is enough, thank you.	He saved our lives.
And where do you lead, boy?	To the place where Death lives.
When did you last sleep, boy?	I'm all right.
Go, join them.	What kind of friend do you think I am?
You!	Me.  May I eat with you tonight?
We meant only to please you.	And do you think I'm not going to eat myself to death this very night? Huh?
He will come for me.	He will not come. You will be my queen.
You see?	Yes.
What's that man's name?	Why do you want to know?
YEAH! I was sure! Come on, tell me! I know him?	No.
OK, I'm fine.	Good.
Good! First shot!	Yeah, but I didn't get him, I got his case and now he's behind the tree. What can I do?
Five minutes. Keep in front of the window.	OK.
Come on, get down!	You were scared, weren't you?
Not taken.	Why?
Don't fear.	I have no fear.
You can't sit here like that.	Huh? Why?
He probably just went somewhere.	Where?
And your store?  What about your new store?  What about all your dreams?	I have new dreams now.
What if you don't make it?	I'll make it.
I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle.	How serious is it?
Then it'll have to wait until I finish.	What?
I have to finish first.	I won't let you die.
I know what you're getting at.	You do?
You thought I sent them?	There was no card.
I thought we both wanted the same things.	I've changed my mind.
I want children.	You've just decided, is that right?
I don't know.	I think it's a different place for each person.
I know where my heaven is.	Where?
What did they ask?	If I had seen you.  By the way I'm sorry about your wife.  They told me.
Why?	Do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
Your parents would want you to be in bed.	You tell stories?
Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat.	By car right?
When are you leaving?	Tomorrow.
There are a lot of people worried about you.	Where am I?
You're in pain.	I need your help.
You're going to have a lot of work to do when I get back.	Someone should be with you.
Good morning.	Good morning.
Is it a boy or a girl?	Oh, that's not mine.
May I ask you a question that might sound strange?	Yes.
I've always wanted a watch like that.	It's yours.
I really want that watch.	This isn't right.
Hello!	Hello.
That is, if you'll come to my room for an hour, I will give you five hundred dollars.	Maybe you shouldn't stand in the road like that. You're pretty drunk.
Mind if I use the bathroom?	Of course.
What's the story? Are you too drunk to come?	I don't care about that. There's time left. You can have more money. You can drink all you want. You can talk or listen. Just stay, that's all I want.
Ben?	Sorry.
Giving you money makes me want to come.	Then come.  I'm going to change. Watch TV. I'll be half an hour.
Why don't you go back to sleep. I'll go out and buy us some breakfast.	Be careful.
What was that all about?	Can we just forget it?
I like it here with you.	Let's stay for a while.
Have you told anyone that I'm here?	No.
Were you with another man?	Go to hell.
Did you get it?	Yes. But I can't tell you what it is.
Sit down.	Is everything okay?
You're not going up there.	Yes, I am.
Why didn't you call me?	What?
I didn't even get to go to his birthday party.	No!
You ready?	No.
I'm a bitch.	Yes, you are.
Hello! You're like, a lawyer.	Not yet.
Good luck.	Thanks again for your help!
Damn. We can't see her for an hour?	No, she can't move for an hour.
Oh, my God!	Oh, my God!!
Someone missed you.	Is he the only one?
How could this happen?	I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
Almost.	Well, hurry up so you can come home! We miss you!
Neither.	Why not?
You're beautiful.	So are you!
C'mon. Let me take you home.	No.
It made me realize something. I'm an idiot.	Really?
There he is!	Pull up next to him!
When the time's come, you won't need to jump, I'll throw you out myself!	Do it now!
What is it?	Something's coming.
We must follow that bird.	Whatever for?
My God!  Look!	Something the matter?
These for me?	If you like.
You promised!	Never.
Oh, dear.	What's the matter?
Sweet Jack.  I'm so sorry you found me asleep.  Don't know what came over me.	I can't have been under much more than a minute.
What do we do now?	We wait.
Where?	Up ahead!
Let that be our problem, just get us there.	You follow.
Are you going to see Sam again?	I thought I might stop by.
He's not there.	He's here.  Check the bathroom.
When does George get to come see his house?	It's so beautiful.
What's that for?	Mom said I should.
He hasn't called?	Who are you?
Mom?	Here, honey!
I put him to work.	What's wrong?
What are you doing up so early?	I couldn't sleep last night.
Don't you have school?	Nope.
My keys.	What's that?
You have to ask like that?	I want you to try something with me, okay?
My mother would die.	Let's shut up and not kill her.
It's not what I was expecting.	What did you think it would be?
Hey.	What are you doing here?
They're trying to make me spend the summer here.  I'm leaving in the morning.	Where to?
You should stay.	I don't know.
Do you remember me from when you lived here?	Yeah.
Huh?	I can use your mom's.
Really?	He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.
What's the point of this?	Does everything have to have a point?
Are you sure you're totally into guys?	What are you talking about?
Hey, I can get you three hundred cash for two hours.	What?
I don't wanna go.	He asked where you were!  He wants you with him.
Why is that?	Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
He won't leave my room.	Will he talk to me?
That would take weeks.	Months.
I'm good, thanks.	What are you on?
I've been here twenty years.	Maybe that's too long.
Oh.	How old are you?
I've got one favor to ask.	What can I do for you, George?
Sam?	Uh huh.
I forgot where I put my keys.	And you thought they might be under her dress?
Hello?	Where are you?  You're driving me crazy, waiting like this.  I want you in me now!
Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.	You'll know me by the time we're through.
Mom, tell him I'm not going.  You already promised me!	You have everything?
I'm not going!	You don't have a choice.
I want you to take out your nose ring and leave it out.	Why?
I don't know.	I'm gonna take a walk.  I need some money.
No one would blame me if I left!	I'd blame you.  I want you here.
If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money.	You'll have money when you work for it.
Where are you going?	I don't know.
Where is it?	A friend of yours is here.
I know the feeling.	How do you become something you're not?
I wish you had told me then.	I'm telling you now.
I loved him too much.	After everything he did to you and your mom?
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?	The kind where there isn't really an answer.
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?	The kind where there isn't really an answer.
And you told Mom today?	Yes.
I don't wanna go, Sam.	Here.
I just wanted to know where Mom was?	Oh.  Sorry.
Lock the door behind you.	Where is he?
What are you doing?	He doesn't answer.
Hey, hey!	I'm married.
I did say he could go.	Let's go.
It makes me sad.	What?
What is it?	I'm fine.  Nothing.  I'll drop by your lunch tomorrow.
I thought you'd be up with the sun.	My stupid back.
You brought your kids?	I kind of said that maybe they could do something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They really wanted to come.  I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  I don't think they'll be too much trouble.
Do you need help?	I think so.
It's been a while.	This was my very first slow dance.
Let's see if you've gotten any better.	Oh, I'm worse.  Much, much worse.
I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George.	How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
Nothing is going on with us, is it?	Going on?
Let's not do this, okay?	I need to know.
Is your back still killing you?	I didn't think you'd come today.
Back.  Neck.  Back.	What?
I could die.	So could I.
Are you going to kiss me?	It's not my back that's killing me.
Don't move!	I'm an idiot to have you up there.
I better get the kids home.	Not a perfect day.
Been thinking?	No.
He already knows everything about what he can't do.  You can tell him not to even look at you, if you want.	I'm thinking it's too weird now.
It's just a joke.  A stupid joke.	I could use the money.
What the fuck?	Everything happens for a reason.  That's what my dad said.
I can't go right now.	You can't go because of Sam?
Where are the kids?	Sam took them to a movie.
No.	Take it off.
Do it now!	If I walk out the door, who's gonna be here tonight for the follow through?
You don't look like you.	Either do you.
I thought I might be able to help, but it looks like you have all you can handle.	Do you like red?
Hey.	Hey.
I've missed you guys.	Why?
Do you know anything about building a house?	No.
What are you doing in my room?	I didn't go in your room.
The door was open.	I don't know what I'm doing.
You're sure about this?	Yeah.
Why do we have to get up and eat with you this early?	I just thought it would be nice.
All day again?	Not all day.  I'll be home after lunch.
I brought a few of my own.	Someone stop her!
Go tell your father we're eating.	Dad's home, already?
A night in the hole?	Better make it a week.
I've never seen you in here before.	That's because I've never been here before.
Don't I know you?	I don't think so.
What?	Nothing.
Nice meeting you? You've been here before, haven't you?	What gave you that idea?
Hey, Ray. I've been looking for you.	Here I am.
I think he's hurt pretty bad.	He's dead.
What do you think you're doing?! The man's been dead for two seconds! Don't you have any respect?	It ain't here.
I wouldn't do that if I was you.	Shut up. It's too damn hot. What do you know, anyway?
You did it, man! You got us out! Next stop, New York City!	New York's a long way's off. Let's just keep moving, okay?
Come on, Ray, time to go!	I'm stuck!
We'll just get off at the next stop.	Say what?
Give me back that hot dog. I'll eat it myself.	What am I gonna eat?
What the hell are you doing?	Don't touch that car.
Why don't he just tell 'em the truth?	He knows nobody wants to hear the truth.
I can't eat this.	Why the hell not?
How you doin'?	I'm all right.
He's from New York City. That one, too.	New York. That's up north, ain't it? They'll find we do things different down here.
Looks like we got a couple of live ones. How long these boys in for?	Judge gave 'em the long ride.
All in, boss!	Move it out.
Appreciate it.	Anybody else need anything read?
No!	Don't do it!
But what about the cash? Can we keep it or what?	Sure, why not?
Keep it up and I just might make you my Queen for a night or two.	You want a queen? Got one right here.
Oh. My. God. I can't believe you're here. Welcome. Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now.	So excited.
I'll call her later.	You know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.
How did you see me?	We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
What is it?	I'm not a hundred percent on that. God said when the time comes, you'll know what to do.
Did you just talk?	No.
Where is he? He's late.	He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.
So far, so good. Now what?	Put it in your mouth.
You'll be alright. Go on. Big day tomorrow. Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about.	Got ya.  Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?
I didn't murder anybody	Look. You were really high. Things happen.
Knock, knock.	Yes, Jimmy.
No. This can't be happening.	Son, just do your best.
Which way did he go?	That way.
You gotta kill yourself.	I'll just go to Heaven.
This town is really going to hell lately.  So what part of the city do you live in?	I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.
I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.	School?
Do me.	I love you.
Why is that funny?	I don't know.
That just hurt a lot.	I've always wanted to kill someone. Can I do it?
We're hungry do you have anything to eat?	Anything to eat?
How do you think we got here??!!	You walked in. I saw you. Don't you remember?
Where do you think we came from?	From? From? From?
Hiding? Yes! Hiding, hiding.	Where do we go?!  Where do we go from here??!!
How do you want us?	Up there.
Let's have sex.  I thought you were curious.	Not about that.
You could have called me yourself.	But I wasn't sure you'd come.
I couldn't get you out of my mind.	I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?	You know.
Why show me?	I'm going to run.
Are you here to help me?	What do you need?
What're you going to do?	That's tomorrow.
I'd rather be with you.	That's nice.
How do we know this is the right way?	It's the only way.
It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.	Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these.
Do you think everything's going to turn to ice?	I doubt it.
Come with us.	Where are you going?
How long have you been living here?	For as long as I can remember.
But there may be a few around somewhere.	What makes you think so?
Are you ready to put him in?	Not yet.
Is that really it? It doesn't seem very far. Will we be there soon?	I promise. We'll go on as soon as it's light.
You want somethin'?	No, I'm okay.
You okay, man?	What?
I like to remember things my own way.	What do you mean by that?
Very strange.	What is?
Might be a good time to try using it again.	Anybody else have a key to the house.
We'll keep a watch on the house.	As best we can.
Now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to.	Yeah.
I was here yesterday.	Yeah, I remember.
I want more.	Me, too.
You liked it.	If you want me to go away, I'll go away.
So, should I call Andy?	Andy?
Set.	Why are ya goin' so early?
Are you my man?	Yes.
You all right?	We killed him.
I don't. I don't know him.	Dick can't be dead. Who told you he was dead?
Hey.	Sit down a minute.
Never saw him before in my life.	Did you tell the police this?
Please tell me.	No.
I wouldn't know how.	You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
What's the matter?	Nothin'.
We know that.	Who was the man?
Who is it?	He won't give his name.
We've met before, haven't we?	I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?
You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight?	What are you going to do?
What's that? Another tape?	Yes, I just found it on the step.
Don't you want to watch it?	I guess so.
We've got to call the police.	All right.
We will.	Thanks, guys.
What the hell is going on?!	I wish I knew.
What was that?!!!	What?
Where would you feel safe?	I don't know. Maybe a hotel.
I thought you were getting me a drink?	Just a minute.
I told you to stay in the car!	Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?
Give that a try.	All right!
You sure you're doin' okay? Everything all right?	Yeah.
I don't think so. Where was it that you think we've met?	At your house. Don't you remember?
What's happening to you? What happened to your face?	I don't know.
You still care about me?	Sure. Sure I do.
Where'd you come from?	I've been here. You were lookin, right at me.
All of it?	Yes. Might as well - all of it.
Two years!?	Yes.
Where are they? Do you see them?	Yes!
What are we going to do?	Well, there's nothing we can do until the morning.
Hey, what's happened to you?	Nothing. Why?
If you want me to!	Sure - sure. Don't you worry. I'll take care of you.
Hey - look!	Look, Bob!
Yes. I'm afraid it does.	Shall we have another?
Please calm yourself. You'll soon be well if you do.	I don't need any advice from you! Get me a doctor!
Are you taking me?	Yes, of course. Certainly. Come on!
No, I can't! I can't! You've got to let me rest! You've got to let me rest!	Hey!
All right, go ahead!  We go on to the next plane. Bring out any people that are left.	Right, Bob.
Bob, these are all that are left.	Come on! Quick! This way.
Just what I needed too.	You?
He's dead.	Dead?
What is it?	See that spot?
George, what do you think you're doing?	Let me go, Bob!
Let me up! Let me up!	All right. Sorry, George.
Well, I - I really don't know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad.	So you think I'm mad?
Look here, Bob, Ever since I can remember, you've looked after me. Now I think you're the one that needs looking after. I'm your brother, Bob. If there's something wrong with you, let me help you.	Oh, George . . .
You can't take her away from here!	Why not?
I guess we're in for it.	In for what?
There are so many questions I'd like to ask you, I hardly know where to begin.	I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
I'm thirty.	Oh, you're going to make life very simple.
How about you? Do you want to go?	Go? Where?
Only the damn guy won't know it.	What happens if I say no?
We'll take it from here.	What?  Who the hell are you?
I'm just saying it was cold.  I think she kind of liked me.	She didn't even know you. .
Something's wrong here.	Gee.  You really think?
Maybe they didn't get here.  Maybe they've been here.	For how long?
Sure.	Me, too.  I feel a long day coming on.
What?	They're inside.
No.  Follow him.	He'll turn around.
Can't you see?  She just wanted her little girl back.	Who wanted her little girl back?
You don't remember me, do you?	We know each other?
Look at the kid.  In this one, he's on the left of the man in the suit.	Yeah?  So?
Go ahead.	Did he close the front door?
Red Ball?	Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
Why did you catch that?	Because it was going to fall.
Just go to the beginning!	Okay.  Fine.  Where the hell is that?
Detective.  Nice of you to come down here.  Seeing as every cop in the world is looking for you right now.  Jesus, what's up with your eye?	I need your help.
What happened?  Where's the rest?	I guess that's all of it.
I won!	What a big boy.  How old are you?
Who are you?	I'm your son.  I'm you.
You're not gonna kill me?	No.
You're supposed to kill me.  He said you would.	Who said I would?
So there is a way to fool the system?	Yes.
Sir, the team's gonna be light without those men.	Yes, I know.
This your work?	Yes.
I like it.	Thanks.  You take anything in your coffee?
I don't have any sugar either.	Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
Since right after we lost our son.	You mean after he lost your son.
Is he cute?	He's okay.
What's wrong, baby?	He's not doing it.
I gotta go, baby. I love you. Tell mommy I called. You be a big girl and be careful when you're alone.	I love you. Come home.
Honey?	Where were you?
Go finish getting ready. I'll take care of dinner.	Yeah? You sure?
I never promised you anything.	How could you let her see this?
Take her.	What'd you say?
C'mon girl. Eat up.	Get away from her.
Where we going?	Quick drop. In and out.
Yeah. Sure.	How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in.
Yes.	What is it?
Hi. I, uh, think that's us.	Hi. I'm Jimmy.
I can wait around if you want.	No. That's cool, man.
We need guns.	We don't need guns.
Holy shit. Can you believe this?	Pretty nice.
You hear that? You can drink as much as you want up here.	We're not supposed to get drunk. We're on call.
What are you doing?	What are you doing?
So is this the drop?	Like I said, I don't know.
Yeah.	So we're working?
You happy?	About what?
Where do you think you're going?	Back in.
What the hell did you do?	I swear to God, I didn't do anything.
We need guns.	We don't need guns.
Hey, boys.	Tom. How's it going?
Where's the surprise?	You want your surprise?
Yes?	Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
Yes.	Where do you live?
I'm not saying shit to neither of you.	Why? What I say bad?
See you later.	You really in trouble?
No shit?	Does anyone want another?
What do you want?	A little Charlie, perhaps.
Here they are, then.	How's it going?
Last thing I want is you with a gun.	Word.
I get it.	Tell me.
Yeah.	What?
I'll get it.	Who's up for a night on the town.
Where can I get a hold of you?	YOU can't. I'll get a hold of you.
I told you less paper, less trouble.	I'm working on it.
Sometimes you got a big ugly mouth.	Yeah, and I'm putting my money where my ugly mouth is. I'm putting you back in the numbers right now.  Baby, what's today?
Daddy, where's my money?	What you talking?
Take it easy, baby.	That really you, Red?
That's bullshit. That's a white man's book. Ain't all these white man's books?	They sure ain't no black man's books in here.
Do you?	Not exactly, but I want to be one, like you.
Sure I'll speak to your class. But I'm a hard man on women. You want to know why?	If you want to tell me.
That's something I haven't done in fifteen years.	What?
Let's talk about you for a change.	There's nothing to talk about.
It won't be easy.	Just hold me.
Why are you looking at me like that?	Because you're in trouble.
Get some sleep.	You have to sleep for three.
Stop calling us. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. I'll kill you. I'll kill you.	Betty it's me. It's me.
I'm gonna try and get some work done tonight.	Let some of us come down there.
Did you see the papers today?	Yes, sir, I did.
Can I ask you something?	Sure, man.
I thought you said we were going to the movies last night.	I say a lot of things.
She know?	If she got eyes, she do.
I better not come in.	I ain't stupid.
Baby, I'll call you tomorrow.	What for? I ain't white and I don't put out.
Another one?	How long has this been going on?
You the man.	You better believe it.
You evil this morning.	What's your story, baby?
Baby, I was gonna give it to you.	Well, bitch you move too slow.
Jesus, Red, she's just a kid.	Jesus ain't got nothin' to do with this.
Don't never try to cross someone who ain't afraid to die.	You the man!
You want to be the head man?	That's right.
[Where are you coming from?]	[South America.]
A lot of people are looking for you.	I guess that makes you the smart one.
Maybe I can help your situation and you mine.	So where do we begin?
Where do I find you?	I'll call you tomorrow.
[Drive.]	[Do you know who I am?]
[Do you know who I am?]	[Who are you?]
[I don't know, I swear.]	[I believe you.]
Who's he?	I don't know, but I know his face.
[The most important thing in life is family. And there you are. You have my family. What do you want?]	[I want you.]
[Yeah.  Yes.]	[Listen! I will give you a life for a life.]
So what's wrong?	Nothing wrong.
What are you doing here?	I came to visit you.
No.	You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?
We're taking a different way home.	That's right.
You're fast.	Once I get in the water but not starting off. By the time I catch up, it's too late.
They'll be back in a week.	They can stay for two weeks. I don't care.
Do you always sleep with him?	I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.
Did you sleep alright?	Yes.
Remember you asked me what state I was from?	Yes.
You're late.	I'm sorry.
Could I ask you a question?	Could I stop you?
You've done much of this work before?	Never.
[You have the money.]	[Yes.]
You should be sleeping, baby.	I'm trying, mom.
Good news. You're going back to school.	When?
I like him, Mom.	You do?
I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very sick.	Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby.
It will be a hard break.	She's young. She'll get over it.
[You only fuck me to get information.]	[You only give information so you can fuck me.]
So what do you feel like doing tonight?	I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
All right, I'll see you!	Where you going?
Who you gonna call?	I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
Hey! What are you doing here?	I came to see you. How you feel?
Hey, I come home from your house last night, Marty was here with a girl.	Who?
You gotta real nice face, you know? It's really a nice face.	Thank you.
Okay, so I'll see you tomorrow night then.	Okay.
What time is it?	About eight o'clock.
Tommy, before you go, I wonder if you gimme a little advice.	Sure, what?
I don't like her.	You don't like her. You only met her for two minutes.
Good. You've both been working close to the front.	Never this close.
Okay, I'm a witness, but how do you prove who's right?	There's only one way.
When will he be able to write?	What's he got to write, for God's sake?
Henry's got our orders! We're going home!	When?
Very well, Your Majesty.  Congratulations, Frank. He picked you.	No, no, that one.
I don't feel anything.	Oh, Jesus.
I can't feel it now either. The mother must have gone in.	I don't get it.
See you.	It's possible
You're asking for somebody else?	It happens to be a matter of life and death.
It was really nice of you to take me along.	I didn't have much choice.
He's coming to.	Let's get his clothes off quick.
What's going on? Who started this?	You mean who hit who?
Can you make out what they're talking about?	I can try, sir.
Morning, girls. Good morning Major.	Good morning.
Can you guys take one minute to look at a kid for me?	Now?
How is he?	Nice.
Huh?	Are you all right?
Do you care if I sit down out here?	No.
You know, I had a crazy dream last night. It was about you.	About me?
How many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, I mean?	I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
Did you write this?	Yes, I did, John. But I had no idea what was going on.
Oh!	Go ahead, open it, open it.
Say that again.	There is no letter. I made it up.
I can read. I can read!	Sorry.
That's our man. He's made to order.	I don't know. He don't seem like a guy that'd fall into line.
Hurry up, Pop.	Oh.
What's the idea?	No, no, no. Now that's too much!
Colonel!	You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.
No sense in going up there! I been here for hours. He ain't here!	Oh, let me go, will you!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.	Both of 'em?
Hey, Boss.	Oh, quiet, quiet, quiet.  Say, tell me something did you read that speech you're gonna make tonight?
Well, I don't get it.	Huh? Get what?
How about family? Got any family?	No.
It's good to see you. Sit down.	Thanks.
Oh, yeah. That's what I mean. See? It was easy as all that, huh?	Uh-huh.
I know one way you can do it.	How?
Have you got the speech I gave you?	Yeah.
What happened? Is there a problem?	May I come in? I would just like to ask you a couple of questions.
Could I please have a little water?	Of course.
This has nothing to do with Walter.	They want Walter dead!
They have less power over you if you look into my eyes.	Huh?
Tell my dad.	Tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
Where's the car?	I need to get something straight first.
Hold on a second here.	Is there a problem?
I want a plane waiting at the airport. I'll tell them where I want to go when I get there.	Is that all?
Come on. Let's go for a drink.	I don't really like to drink.
You got a girlfriend?	Why? You like my ass?
Yeah, I've got a girlfriend.	You living together?
They need to run first and second?	Yeah, first and second.
We won!	We lost.
How long you been coming here?	About six years. My partner took me.
What the fuck is going on.	I don't know, but I've got to get on there.
It might have happened no matter who was up there.	Bullshit! Would it have happened to you?
How many have you lost?	I look at it as how many I've saved. That's the way you've got to look at it.
Yeah. I'm sorry.	Can I come in?
Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.	What do you want from me?
I wanted to get this out of the way.	You got a bet on the game tonight?
It's already started.	I was going to catch the last half on TV.
You like this place?	It's very nice.
And a car.	Hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. Get a car of your own.
There are two million people in there with you.	Yes.
Why?	To live forever.
How come I can't remember?	Because I took it out of your memory.
You were right.	About what?
But this is impossible.	That's the grace of this world.  Nothing's impossible.
What's happening?	Nothing, go back to sleep.
It's time to wake up.	Wake up?!
But what would happen to me?  I have no body to return to.	Not my problem.
You sure he's going to come?	It's his nature.
What's her name?	Who?
What did he tell you?	The truth.
Then you had her killed.	Why would I do that?
Someone you have to get back to?	No.
That's why they told you you can't go inside.  They can't have you running into her.	Her?
Why?	It was a test.
To see how long it would take for me to realize.	Realize?
And it meant something.	Yes.
What?	Way you kiss me.
I wasn't with you.	I know.
I'm sorry.	Sorry?!
What's so funny?	This.  No point to it.
It was just there.	There?
We've come all this way for a rock wall?!	There should be a way to open it.
You okay?	I think so.
I'm in!	LET'S FLY!
I'm outta here.	Wait for me!
GET OFF ME!	BUT I'M YOUR COUSIN!
Don't you ever have anything nice to say?!	Well, if I did I certainly wouldn't say it to you!
THREE SECONDS!!	LET'S DO IT!?
Up here, Boss.	That ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
Maybe you better hear what I got to say first.	Whatever you say, Boss.
I had everything. Once.	So what happened?
We could lose the deal!	If we have to.
You ain't even a man yet.	That ain't what your mama said.
Inside, they were talking of you.	I can just imagine.
What's the matter?	I must be going.
Come on. It's Christmas. At least stay for breakfast.	I'm already late.
A lot of shit came out of me in the hospital. I'm sorry you got hit by it.	You must be feeling better, if you're looking for sex again.
Charlie?	I'm doin' business here!
We'll figure out something.	I'm supposed to be at my old man's for Christmas dinner at eight.
At first, it will hurt you. But you will come to understand and we will be strong together.	You're fuckin' crazy. You're all fuckin' crazy!
Forget it.	Fuck 'em.
So we're gonna knock 'em both off?	If it comes to that. Yeah.
Everybody's talkin' about ya, Charlie. First time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived.	Guess I'm just lucky.
Yes?	I'm comin' for my twenty thousand.
 I beg your pardon?	I didn't say anything.
Kid - didn't they tell you about this party?	Tell me what?
Land of Death. How do I get there?	Kid, listen: that's all I'm saying. And you didn't hear it from me.
Look at this! He won't let us leave!	Who?
Did we just - hit something?	I don't think so.
Don't ask where I got it.	You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?	No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.
Where'd he go??	I don't know.
Oh, please, don't hurt me.	I just need to use the phone, lady.
Who told you we deal drugs?	I'm just concerned about my daughter.
Is there something else I can do for you?	Well, I'd love to see inside your club.
So, what do you think?	Well, once you're inside, it's nice.
Where to?	Are you sure you got my bag in?
Tell me why!	Well, because you're doing all right at the minute.
Did you like the first act?	Yeah. What about the second act?
Mr. President!	Mr. President!
I wouldn't wait if I were you.	What do you mean? What's going on?
Jim!	Just a minute, Joe!
No. Don't ever want to go out without telling us.	Who are you?
That's going to be fun.	Some people like it.
We'd like to get in touch with him. It's very important.	Who's that?
Most every day.	Sometimes twice.
For no reason, I guess. He always does it. We always run into the house when we see him coming.	Never can tell what he's going to do.
Are you married?	Yes, sir.
No. Are you?	No.
I don't mind though. I had a lot of fun doing it.	Would you like to go for a walk?
Would you like to walk the rest of the way? It's so nice out.	Yes.
You know, you said something to me when you first met me that I've thought about a great deal.	What's that?
I've often thought about going back.	You have?
Couldn't sleep. Kinda wanted to talk to you. Do you mind?	No - not at all. I couldn't sleep either.
The reason why I wanted to take a walk, Mary, is 'cause I wanted to talk to you.	Let's just walk, okay?
Mary, I'm going home.	Are you? When?
Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me.	No, I don't mind.
Would you like to read it? It's to you.	Yes, of course.
Hello, Mary?	Oh, hello darling.
Just a minute. No, you don't.	We're not going out tonight.
Why there she is!  Of course she's home.  Stupid of me . . .	Hello.
How'd you get the picture?	Had the boys follow us.
What're you going to do?	I'm going to tell him the truth.
Come on, come on!	Hurry up!
You try it.	Me, sir?
How's it going? Okay?	Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir.
Sit over there, will you?	Me sir?
How is this, sir?	Perfect! Perfect!
You can't come up here!	Let me go! I wanna see him!
He's what?	What was that you said he was?
That's pretty.	Are you sure this is the town he lives in?
I can't find him.	You can't?
Look!	What?
I'd like to ask you a few questions.	All right.
Come in, please. Come in. Can I get you a cup of tea?	No, thanks.
Have a drink?	No, thanks.
Huh? On, no. Nobody important.	Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
Who are they?	I don't know.
Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.	Thank you so much. Good night.
No, sir.	Excuse me. What did you say?
Yes, sir.	What's that?
You came home last night - without them.	I did what!
Yes, sir. I beg pardon, sir, but did you ever find what you were looking for, sir?	Looking for?
Hey, did you hear that?	What, sir?
Shall I call the police, sir?	No!  What do you want!!
What are you doing for lunch?	Right now?
I've run on. Forgive me. We're here to talk about you.	Are we?
What?	Stop now.
Where's your wife, Henry?	Go to hell.
What's that?	You are so mean.
What is it?	It's a thought I had.
Do we run into the street? No, I didn't think so.  Nice car. How's that place?	It's a pretty piece of land.
But you know how to drive?	Sure.
What's wrong with her?	Is she a friend of yours?
What's happening here?	We're going for a walk.
What'd you want?	There's something I think we need to talk about.
Feel free to lie down. Most people do.	I'd better not, I'll fall right to sleep. I think it's too soon for me to be sleeping with you.
You're doing great.	I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
Is that when you split up?	No, that'd be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end. We went on for another year or so.
When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out. I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down.	That's what I like.
Hello?	Hello.
You got off easy.	Will you wait for me?
I don't think you know what you're talking about.	Uh-huh.
Can I ask you a personal question?	Of course! That's exactly what I want.
I hope you don't think I want you to do this for free. Just because we're gonna play it like we're friends, doesn't mean I won't pay you like a doctor.	I understand.
This is great!	This is exactly what I wanted.
Who else knows?	Just you.
Damn! What is your name?	Doesn't matter. You can call me Doc.
I've told you a lot of private stuff.	I can tell you anything else.
Let's make us even, shall we?	Even?
C'mon, friend.	Why do you like to fight so much?
Where's your new friend?	What friend? You're my only friend.
Yeah?	Oh yes, always.
The key!? She has the lost key!?	Yes. No one has ever had so much, been so close. We must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.
And what is he in prison for?	I did not know, so when I heard you were coming, I asked him that myself.
You lie.	I would never!
Yeah, I was there.	You swear?
Yes.	Really want to know?
We're almost there.	Are you sure?
That "thing" gets me excited.	The things that get you excited.
A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.	Who was talking about what?
Got it!	Got what?
Have you no respect for the dead?	Right now, I only wish to join them.
What do you suppose killed him?	Did you ever see him eat?
Where's my gun?	What are you going to do? Shoot him?
Believe it, sister. That's what brought our buddy back to life.	And now he's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back
What?	What?
He was the last time I saw him.	When was that?
Come on, baby!	Do it, big boy!
But she's your mother. You gotta tell her.	I can't.
Sounds good to me.	Let's do it.
What did you do with Captain Amazing?	Captain who?
Come here.	I'm not that kind of girl.
Stay away!	Or you'll what? CAN ME?
Or talk?	Not tonight. 
Hi.	Alone tonight?
Leave him alone. She's his mother, not yours.	We had an off night, that's all.
There's a big difference.	I used to believe that. Now I'm not so sure.
GET MAD!	But I just don't feel it.
But she still might call!	Are you coming or not?
Cover me!	With what?
Maybe she's right.	Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for!
What's that?	Come on.
Jeffrey!	Oh hi, Mom.
She likes you.	Definitely.
This is bad.	Who are they?
To us!	Whatever our name is.
Are you sure he's still lives here?	Are you sure he's still alive?
Maybe it's time we checked that place out.	But how do we get in?
That was too close.	But we gotta find out what's going on in there.
It's time.	With or without him, we gotta go!
Where am I going?	Through there!
Was the trip normal in every respect?	Yes, sir.
I haven't been there for three years.	I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
And you, are you in love with any one else?	No.
Promise me you will never leave me.	I cannot promise you that.
Who is it?	It's me.
I believe you sent for me.	Yes, yes, please sit down.  I will be with you in a moment.
You could hear them?	Yes.
You mean you heard them making love?	Yes.
Okay, I know what I want this time.	Anything you need.
Who are you?	I'm his cousin.
No I'm not.	I'll do it.
What you mean talk to her?	You know what he mean, dude.
For sure.  That's how I like 'em.	Not me.
It's about to work, just come on.	What about the dog?
This you?	Yeah, that's me.  Just a little somethin' somethin' I picked up.
Man, this a cool house.	Thanks, I just wish my mother had a chance to see it.
Just a little.	I can't taste nothing.
Who is that?	That's the sister.
So.	What you mean, so?
I walked.	You walked?
You know what this is?	Yeah, that's why I walked down here.
How can they do this?	I don't know.  Did ya'll forget to pay it or something?
I ain't trying to get in it.	You already in.
Blow.	That ain't gonna work.
It works.	Still gonna smell it.
What we gonna do?	I don't know yet.
You see that?	I didn't see nothing.
I hope to God that dog is happy.	Me too.
Wait.	Wait for what?
You want us to give you a ride?	I don't know.
Hello, remember me?	Hell yeah, I remember you.
Huh?	What are you doing here?
You did all this for me?	Most of it.  I just hate to see you in this situation.
I did.  Is that door locked?	It's locked.
You alright?	Yeah, I'm cool.  See you later.
You see that?	I saw it.
What is it?	Don't worry about it, man.  Get the phone.
That the big one, huh?	You damn right that's the big one.
What was that?	You don't wanna know.
You wanna knock?	Go for it.
Hey.	Ya'll live around here?
What?!  What that mean?	I don't know.
Hey, guys, I'm outta here.	Thanks for the help.
Ah damn.  Damn.	I got fired too.
What the fuck you looking at?	Nothing.
Just do it.	I don't know the number.
Hey, how you get out of here.	I don't know.
I thought you were taking me to see Mama?	I'll take you later.
Hey, what's going on?	Nothing.  What you want?
My back.	What's the matter?
All right, I'll do it.	That's my girl.
Somebody close?	What?
How do you know that?	I saw her die. She was shot. With this gun.
You shot her?	No.
Can we go now?	Of course. I'll get a car to drive you.
Good luck.	Same to you.
Hey! I'll take the girl. I'll take the girl!	Don't worry. She's good with kids.
Yes, yes, I understand.	Good.
You're out of your mind.	What's your point?
You get another chance in ten minutes.	Then I have time for a drink.
What would you do in my place?	Me?
I killed you.	You fucked up.
Come back.	How do I know you won't kill my daughter once I'm gone?
I don't know.	You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me.
Are you sure?	I've heard this speech a lot. Come on. We'll take care of him.  We will.
I think you better put that away.	I think you're right.
Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss like that?	On TV.
So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?	No way.
He has to say "over and out". Daddy, you have to say "over and out".	Over and out.
Will you promise me that?	I promise.
Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?	I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that.
Keep the change.	Don't think I won't.
You said there was only one person you knew wasn't in on this thing.	Yeah.
Well?	I don't know.
What are you going to do!?	This is about power and you haven't got any. There's nothing more you can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying.
Hey!	I think this is worth a dollar.
Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it?	It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that?	Everybody does?
That's pretty good.	I've done much better ones than this.
I'm not a baby.	You're a big girl, huh?
Close your eyes.	Why?
You got this under control?	Yeah.
It's under control.	It better be.
Where is he? Did you lose him?	Shut up.
I'm looking for them.	Where?
And what happens if I don't call you?	I kill her anyway.
You talk to a cop, you even look at a cop too long and your daughter is dead.  Do it.	Go ahead, sugar Die.
Yeah.	Do it!
Come Back.	Yeah.
Any trouble?	No.
He never told about the money.	No.
I'm hungry, John.	We'll steal somethin' to eat.
John, where's your folks?	Dead.
Did you hear what I said, son?	Huh?
Tell me what, boy?	Nothin'!
She thinks that money's in the river, but you and me, we know better, don't we, boy?	I don't know nothin'!
Nothin'. 	Come to me, boy!
Sure, that's no secret.	What's your name?
Yes; John's bad.	Tell me another secret about my Dad.
What's wrong, John?	Didn't you hear me, boy?
What do you want?	Them kids!
How long's this been going on?	Since the murder. She was fine before that.
Okay, good. She's asleep.	Thank God.
Okay?	Okay, okay.  I think.
Hello?	Hi.
Bring him out of what?	My dream.
How you doing, pal?	Okay. Hi, dad.
Sure, okay, I'll be there. Now you just turn in and get some rest, sweetheart. Please. Deal?	Deal.
Had to've done it. No one else was in there.	How you know that?
Where you think you're going?	School.
Did you sleep?	I'll sleep in study hall, promise. I'd rather keep busy, you know?
Right home after.	Right home after. See you.
You okay?	Great
Take this, it'll help you sleep.	Right.
Give me the key, mother.	I don't even have it on me, so forget it.
Your old man thinks I did it, don't he?	He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
Someone else was there.	The door was locked from your side.
No.	Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
Do you think I did it?	No.
What the hell you doing here?	Came to make up, no big deal. Your ma home?
Now let's forget everything except that we're together.	That's right.
You found your way to us and we weren't easy to reach, were we?	No, no.
Well, it means another two weeks in Paris.	Too bad we have to waste all that time.
You, please.	Me?
Can I help you?	You might hold this for me.
Do you hear that?	It's twelve o'clock.
I suppose you don't think that's funny?	No.
Not funny, huh?	No.
It's nine o'clock.	That's when one half of Paris says to the other half, "What are your plans for this evening, madame?"
Don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart.	No. Nobody will find us.
What shall we get? The news!	No, no news. We don't want to know what's happening in the world. We want to be left alone, don't we?
No music.	No, no music.
Thank you.	Is this your new dress suit?
Good morning.	What?
Bring me something simple. I never think about food.	But, madame! If you don't think about food what do you think about?
We could check the tape again, sir.	You don't need to check the tape.  I know what I said.
It's a code or something.	I figured that out.
Gentlemen, I think it's about time for us to be getting to the airport.	Let him finish, Bob.
We haven't said grace yet.  Richard.	Is it my turn?
It's a gift, Richard.  This law school is a gift from your brother.	Did he have to die for me to get it?!
What'd he say?	What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.
Where'd you find him?	Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.
Like you said Jack, I'm just a New York lawyer now.	We'll see about that.
Mr. President, the press guys asked if you could come back for a minute.	The hell with 'em.
I'll do it.  No more.	Are you serious?
Hi, Buddy.  What are you doing in here?	I've missed you.
Congratulations, Dick.	How am I going to break this to Bob Hope?
Yes.	When?
Why didn't you?	You can't expect me to explain that to you.
But being out of the game gives me time to write.	To what?
How'd you know I was here.	Who else'd be in your truck.
Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is.	You ain't heard from him?
We goin' in?	Gun out and up.
Probably must be.	So when was he here?
It ain't even three years we been married.	Three years ago I said them very words. No and Good.
No.	I ain't got the money.
Did you buy that gun?	No. I found it.
Where does he work?	Did you not hear me? We can't give out no information.
What's this about?	Step out of the car please, sir.
Who is this.	You know who it is.
You know how this is going to turn out, don't you?	No. Do you?
Is somethin' wrong?	With what?
Will there be anything else?	You already asked me that.
You don't know what you're talking about, do you?	Sir?
Call it.	Call it?
Good. I need everything else.	Okay.
That's my son! My son is dead!	I'm sorry.
Why do they keep calling you George?	I don't know. Why do you keep calling me George?
I haven't been this happy since I was twelve years old.	What happened when you were twelve?
Why are you doing this to me?	Why am I doing this to you? Isn't this what you wanted?
I left my husband two days ago.	Really?
I got this apartment with a guy.	The one you were telling me about?
Guess who I saw today.	Who?
Either you're making a fool out of me because you get off on it, or you got serious problems. Which one is it?!	I have no idea what you're talking about.
Looking for someone?	You never know who you'll see.
Does he know you think he's real?	He is real.
This isn't fair, you know. Do you always get what you want?	No, almost never.
All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.	If we're for real?
He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.	Should I kill him now?
They said find it. Find her, find it. Finish the job you were paid to do.	Half.
Really?	You better believe it.
All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!	No! Let me try this!
I'm sorry we got you into this, Tommy.	Good Lord, what do we do?
It's Tommy! They got Tommy!	Oh my God!
Well, I'm sorry honey -	Well, we need that ring.
A million dollars.	Million point two.
Daddy!	He ain't our daddy!
Come back here, kid!	What for?
Joe!	Come over here where I can see you.
You're good.	Get on your feet and find out how good, sir.
What did you call me?	Pardon?
Now when I say "understand" I want the whole group to say, "Yes, sir!" Understand?	Yes, sir!
Something tells me you've been here before.	Now what on earth would give you an idea like that?
Come on, guys. It's five o'clock.	One more minute.
That was you guys, huh?	Come on. Let's go dance.
Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?	Great.
You serious about having him over?	I haven't made up my mind.
You got a girl?	No, and I'm not looking for one either.
I hear most of the girls who come to these things are looking for a husband.	Not me.
I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.	He didn't give you much choice.
That was great.	It sure was.
Hi.	Are those for me?
I'm looking for Sid.	So?
I'd like to come with you.	Why?
You okay?	Sure.
That isn't true, is it?	A little.
Talk to me in the morning. I feel like shit.	But it can't wait.
What?	A woman and a little girl, both asleep upstairs.
You're fuckin' A we can do this.	Not with me.  Not with people.
You're welcome.	Peace out.
What if she called the cops?	She didn't.
What the fuck is funny about this?	God.
You should see the look on your face.	The fuck did you do that for?!
Me.  I am.	That's right.
What?  What do you want me to do?	What do you think?  Get us into that room.
Are you okay?	Hurry up, for Christ's sake!
Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a little more, and your mom'll give it to you.  You can wait a half hour, can't you?	Yeah.  She can.  She's fine, she's just like, tired, she's gotta rest. You rest, Kid.  Half an hour.
She's fuckin' crazy, she killed the kid!  She just killed her own kid!	It's not her fault, it's not her fault, the guy must have called them.  Look, look, look, she's telling us.
She's gonna handle it.	She better.
That's your problem.	That's their problem.
Let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here.	You finish.  Then we finish.
Bullshit.	You know how this gotta end.
YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!	FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!
Fuck.	I know.
Fuck!	Keep your voice down.
I mean, right?  Isn't it?	You're an idiot.
They won't get hurt.	What about us?  What if she has a gun?
Open it.	I did.
She's never coming out.	Hey.
You walk out that door and you lose your share of the money.	Yeah, whatever.
Yeah?	Everything okay?
'Bout four o'clock.	I don't get it.
Somebody called you?	Can we come in?
Can we come in?	Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?
Wait a minute, wait a minute.  We can still handle this.  Can we still handle this?	It's just the woman and the kid?
Cut it back a little bit.	No fucking way.
We're leaving.	The hell we are.
Something's weird.	What?
Makes me nervous.	Why?
Fuck him.	Don't.
What's going on?!	People.  In the house.
He's going down.	That room!
Damn it!	It doesn't work?!
Can't hear a thing.	What do they want?
What do we do?	Wait.
"What we want is in that room."	They're coming in here, aren't they?
Oh, please.	Give me a break.
Small space?	Don't though. 
What, what, what is it?!	On the floor!  Get on the floor!
Do it.	Yeah, but where's the third guy?
If it looks like I can't get back, just close the door.	No.
Call Dad!	On it!
He'll do something.	Uh uh.
I'm sorry.	I'm sorry.
You're Judge right? We need to talk.	I don't know you and I got nothing to say to you.
Get out of the car.	What's with you?
We appreciate your help with this.	So what's the deal?
Welcome brother, have you decided to get down with us?	I'm down.
Yeah, I do.	Well, act like it. Come on.
Huh?	He had a feeling you'd be coming by.
What's up with you?	Nothing.
When?	Late summer.
You don't know him very well, do you?	He's my father.
Excuse me?	I said, I'm not my sister.
Father, there's something else I need to talk to you about.	What?
It was a different time, son.  And you're a better man than that.	I see, do as I say, not as I do.
His wife was killed yesterday.  She was with child.	I'm sorry, I didn't know.
Don't touch him.	How many men have we seen die?
How far away?	Four, five miles.
Thank you.	For what?
How many came back?	About a hundred and twenty.  Less than a third.
Put those away.	But father, they might come this way.
Please hurry.	I will. Come and kiss me.
Is he really all right?	Yes.
I'm not tired!	I'm sure you're not.
Do you swear?	I swear.
You need a glass?	Not at all.
You folks ready to go on?	Sure.
Loved that cat pretty well, didn't she?	Yes.
What do you mean?	The place we're going is on the other side of that.
There's a lot of funny things down this way, Louis.	You're telling me.
It's funny, all right.	Just don't stop, Louis. You don't ever want to stop down here in Little God.  And you don't ever want to look behind you, whatever you hear.
Almost there, Louis.	You keep saying that.
Doesn't look like they last long.	Don't worry about that.
Can I have another one?	I guess it wouldn't hurt.
Let her go. It's cool.	Louis, the house is beautiful.
My God!	It's beautiful!
I'm going to try to do better.	You're doing fine.
What's in your head, boy?	She.  Goes.  Free.
No, I really think I do.	All right then.
Now?	Now.  No, don't kill him.
You?!	Me!
Come on!	No.  This won't work.  I'll stay behind, and fight them. You go on.
What?  What's wrong?  How will this help us get off the island?	It won't.  It won't, and so we won't.
Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?	That he is.
Move away.	No.
I can get you out of here.	How?  The key's run off.
No.	I'll lead them away.
Do you have any idea where you're going?	Jack!
Are you certain this is the right way?	It's the right way.
I think he's telling the truth.	He's not telling the truth.
Has my daughter given you an answer yet?	No.  She hasn't.
How long do you leave him in there?	Until he's done.
I should kill you right now for what you did to me!	Maybe you should, but you can't.
Did you feel that?	Did I?  I've been waiting for that for years.
Hey!	You don't want this.
Sir, please try to hold still.	So, I guess it worked.
Look at this!	What about it!
Just like old times.	Yeah.  Old times.
That's pretty good.	Getting used to it.
I don't believe it.  You're here! Oh thank God.	You didn't think I could just leave you?
Things do change.	I guess they do.
What?  I'm not going anywhere!	Oh yes you are!
All the different ways that I could kill you.	Oh yeah?
Don't mind Mother.	I don't mind her if you don't.
Will - uh - five thousand be enough?	For what?
I'm not going!	What are you talking about?
That's an excellent idea.	Oh, hello Mother!
Fine. Have a seat.	Thanks, I will.
This way.	Oh, man!
Thank you very much.	All right, all right, don't mention it.
Impossible. Put it on again.	Hey, make up your mind, will you?
How's that?	Not bad - not good - but not bad. You ought to be able to fool about almost anybody.
Look, I quit!	Yeah?
Say, you are nice. You're all right. You'd make a good wife.	Thank you, sir.
All right, outside!	I beg your pardon, sir?
I think I understand, sir. You mean you want me to go?	There you are. You caught on. You see, you're nice and you're smart too. You caught on right away. Outside! Go on! Outside! And don't come back!
Thanks, thanks.	I hope you'll be very happy.
Oh sure, we'll be happy. What's the matter with your eyes?	It's the smoke.
They all consider me just as one of the boys.	Right!
Come in, Joe. It's all right.	Hello, Joe.
Can I ask you a question?	Sure.
What?	It doesn't matter.
You sure you want to know this?	Yes.
It's okay. It's alright.	I can't go out there. How can I go out there?
Does it look okay?	Looks just like it did.
Wait.	What?
Thank you.	Sure.
Oh, hello Betty.	Hello Bill.
Having kind of a tough time.	I think it looks nice.
What is that?	I don't know.
You can't go out there.	But I really should get home.
I told you where I was.	All night?
Oh.  I can't.	Why not?
I'm busy.	With what?
Did you do this?	Yes I did.
YOU'RE OUT OF ORDER!	Why am I out of order?
How'd you know about the fire?	What?
What are you doing?	What are you doing?
God, David. Just give it to me!	Get lost!
Oh my God.	What happened?
What did you do?	I don't know.
Oh God.	What's going to happen?
I don't believe this.	Neither do I.
I still don't see why we're doing this.	We're supposed to be in school.
What did you do to him?	Nothing.
You have no right to do this.	Well if I don't who will?
I had nothing to do with that fire.	It's okay.
What's wrong?	Nothing.
Can I ask you a question?	Yes.
So what's it like?	What?
What do we do?	We'll just put up the top.
Where are they?	I'm not sure.
You're gonna forget about me.	No I won't. I swear.
I like calling you David.	I like it too.
Oh hi!	Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.
Look, you can't always like what you do. Sometimes you just do it because it's your job. And even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway.	Why?
Well don't you?	I think you should try not to think about this anymore.
Oh, hi.	Hi.
What's wrong?	I'll never be able to do that.
Hey.	Hey.
Did you think that we'd all be looking at you?	No, no, no.
You just said very food.	Did I say that?
Hey, what are you doing? Why are you wearing a suit again?	I don't know.
Yeah I can't.	OH MY GOD. Look at that.
Goodbye.	Call me later.
Hello, this is Back.	Hi, is this Jack?
Hello?	Hey. What are you doing? How are you?
So you think you can?	No. I'm sorry.
Is it ok if I leave my car you think?	I don't know.
Hi.	Hi.
Business is good, you're busy?	Yeah, not really.
I'm going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me?	Sure.
This is funny.	Yeah.
That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you for saying that.  You're friends with my sister?	Yeah.
Is everything ok?	Yes.
I have a better idea of where we can go.	Ok.
There's a better place for us to eat.	Did something happen; are you alright?
That was good.	Yeah.
Do you wanna have sex?	Yeah.
Where do you have to go?	For what?
I forgot about that.	Can I come home with you when we get there?
Are you ok?	I'm fine are you ok?
Why?	Just have you for one second, please.
Yeah.	Did you do it?
Can we agree that that is that?	That's that.
Sorry about that.	I didn't know you had a sister?
Yeah.	That was weird. I meant good.
Hey.	Hi.
It's three hundred and twenty dollars, just take it.	What do you have in the house?
That's cool.	When can you leave?
So they'll go.	I'm only paying two of you guys.
I'll go pay for my car.	Are you sure?
I can't find that thing in my car, I can't find it so I'll just get it and give it to you later. So?	You ready?
Free his mouth.	Mustn't do that, sir.
If you won't read it to your own Mama, then perhaps you ought not to be reading it at all.	It's not your cup of tea, Mama.
Doesn't that please you?	Very much.
So you ever gonna do a picture?	Not you too
I did my best but, well, you know me	Sure
I wonder. Do you have any idea what you have done?	Do you?
How bad is it?	Nothing for you to worry about, darling
Then you explain it to me?!	There's nothing to explain
Fuck you, Mr. Kane.	I will not have this in my home.
Yes.	Please don't say this.
I want you back	Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out.
If he had known about KANE before you made it, you'd be dead already.	It's too late. The movie's made
You talked to New York?	Yes
Yes	Get out
I think you better sit down	I don't want to sit
How 'bout a real drink?	We done?
What's up, Colonel?	I'd like to talk to Jake a minute.
This looks done.	It's not done.
Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?	I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
Do you see her yet?	Give me a chance. Let me look.
You want us to wait for you?	No, take her home. I wanna be alone for a while. Everybody go.
Excuse me for a minute. Be right back.	Don't be long. I'm afraid with all these tough guys here.
Don't fight anymore!  It's a free country, don't fight anymore!	Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it?
It ain't worth it, Jake. Get out.	What time is it?
You don't talk very much.	I ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
I can't find my ball.	Can you see it?
Can you see it?	No.
Are you sure we should be doing this?	Come over here.
Now take the rest off.	Jake, you made me promise not to get you excited.
What're you lookin' at? You lookin' at him?	No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.
Hey, you don't say goodbye to him like that.	What did I do?
Where you been all day?	I took the kids to my sister's.
The kids are sleeping.	I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.
Hi, Tommy. How are you?	Jake, sit down for a minute.
Talk some sense into him, will ya? You're still his brother. If he ain't gonna listen to you, he ain't gonna listen to nobody!	All right, I'll try. See you later.
I would say that is looked as if she wasn't coming back.	That's what they call a family problem.
Read some good books.	I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
Can you get me that ring back?	No.
The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else.	I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
I wonder.	What?
What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in?	Smart girl.
Something big going on somewhere?	Going on right here. It's a big night.
What a day I've had!	Tired?
You don't think either one of us could ever change?	Right now, it doesn't seem so.
I'm not exactly on the other side of the room.	Your mind is. And when I want a man, I want all of him.
Don't you ever have any problems?	I have one now.
I wonder where he's going now?	I don't know.
Well, I guess it's safe to put on some lights now.	Not yet!
Wasn't that close?	Too close.
I'll try to give you at least fifteen minutes.	How?
What's happening?	Good luck, Buzz.
You know something?	What?
Just him.	Stay there.
Sure.  It's fine.	Okay.
What time is it?	Hang loose.  We got all night.
Tell him why we moved here.	Hold it, Jim.
You thought I was Mom?	Yeah!
Blood.	How'd that happen!  What kind of trouble you in?
Will you let him tell it!	She never wants to hear.  She doesn't care!
Except yourself!	Will you wait a minute?
I don't see what's so bad about taking a little drink.	You don't?
Excuse us a minute?	Sure.  Sure.
You sure?	I think I know my son.
I guess I cut pretty loose in my day too.	Really, Frank?  When was that?
See?  It stopped.	I still think you should go down.
Who's there?  Anyone there?	Open it.
Is he there?	No, honey.  No, he's not here.
Frank!	Stay here.  That was my son!
They not together, sir.  We don't see him in a long time now.	Do you hear from him, son?
Hi.	Hi there.
Boy!	What?
What's your name!	Jim.  What's yours?
Listen, I told you not to fool with them.  Now they're waiting for you.	I know.  That's why I came back.
I'm here.	They're still there!
Jim!	Who's that!
Hey where'd you go?	I'm here.  Shut up.
I came here before.	When was that?
I don't want you for my father!	Your father!
Can I keep it?	What do you think?
Who's that?	Just a guard.
Those aren't my friends.  Make them go away.	Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back?
I'm sorry.	All right, darling.
The kids take me.	Oh.
I'll bet you're a real yo yo.	A what?
You cold?	Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold.
Why did you do that?	I felt like it.
Where you going?	I don't know, but we can't stay here.
No!	We have to go back!
Is he your friend?	Yes.  My best friend.
She's being called for.	You said you'd call my father.
Good evening.	Hi.
Didn't you forget something?	What?
I was talking to Dad.	I didn't kiss her so it's a big thing.
You promised me!	And you promised me you'd get your sweetheart to help!
He wants the money.	No, baby. He wants me.
I can't take watching you touch him. I can't take his hands on you.	One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.
Do that again.	What.
I told you, Nick. Remember?	Tell me again.
NO!	NICK!
Get the hell off of me!	Nick, it won't work. It won't work!
That guy knows you?	Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike.
You saved my life.  You could have run, but you didn't. You saved me.	You saved me.
They'll have guns.	What?
WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK!	Yeah. That's love.
I saved your life.	You shouldn't have.
Who are you now.	You got the wrong guy! She thinks I'm Nick, I'm not!
Hey. She says she loves you, Nick.	She says a lot of things.
Where's she work?	What?
We walked the place for a week.	And I worked there. For a year.
You got one hour.	I'm gonna need some money.
I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK!	GO!!!
DROP 'EM! DROP, DROP, DROP!!!	DROP THE GUNS! NOW!
What's the first thing, man? What's the first thing you're gonna do?	Haven't thought about it.
She's gonna be out there, man. Right there. Right there waiting.	Yeah.
Why you gotta say a thing like that.	I'm just saying.
Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas.	I'M NOT NICK!
That's what it looks like!	Since when? What the hell is this room?
Alone at last.	Now where were we?
I asked you a question. Are you clear about that?	Yes.
Holy shit, this guy's all fucked up!	No shit, he's gonna fuckin' die on us if we don't get him taken care of.
Daddy, did ya see that?	What?
Daddy, I'm sorry, I don't know what's happening.	That's okay, Eddie, I do.
We were set up, the cops were waiting for us.	What? Nobody set anybody up.
Jesus Christ!	You can do some crazy things with it.
Let's go over it. Where are you?	I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out.
That's great, guy, thanks a bunch.  When do you think you'll need me for real work?	Well, it's kinda a strange time right now. Things are kinda -
Give me this fucking thing.	What the fuck do you think you're doin'? Give me my book back!
Joe, I don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong.	Like hell I am.
I know.	You do?
Follow you where?	Down to my car.
For what, the cops?	Nice Guy Eddie.
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why the fuck didn't you say that in the first place?	You didn't ask.
Want a smoke?	Why not?
So, is he dead or what?	He ain't dead.
We ain't taking him to a hospital.	If we don't, he'll die.
Is that supposed to be funny?	We don't think this place is safe.
He seems all right now, but he went crazy in the store.	This is what he was doin'.
Who shot who?	Nobody. The light was bad.
You don't know how good it is to see you.	Maybe you won't feel that way after I tell you what I stopped in for.
If you were in his shoes would you take one of us home?	I'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it.
There's a nice boy.	Yeah.
So that was why she tried to run away.	Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
I'm sorry, but that's how it's got to be.	I suppose it is.
Are we leaving?	It's too light yet.
Better go on back and get some more sleep. You'll need it later on.	You're not going out to look for them?
Tell me, darling.	What?
So grab yourself some sleep while you have the chance.	If you want to go on, I can make it all right.
I won't have you fighting over me.	I'm sorry.
I can't change either. Not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand.	Hurry up.
I'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. Somebody who wants me as I am will maybe walk into the place where I'm working and take me out of there.	Maybe they will.
Where you going?	To the other side of the street.
That job you were talkin' about, did you get it yet?	Why?
There was only three of them at first. I guess I lost my head.	How'd you happen to miss?
Come on. We got a couple hours to eat and get some sleep.	I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
Go on, hit me.	Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
You know what she asked me?	I don't care what she asked you.
Half of them are mine.	You'll get your share. Go on. I don't want you around.
Is that the only reason you came back?	Sure. What other reason would there be?
Yeah, how did you know?	The whole state's lookin' for 'em.  And they're lookin' for me.
Suppose I take a look.	Go ahead.
Goodbye and thanks.	I don't like to see you go.
I tried my best, but these things take time.	And we're running out of that.
You're not giving up?	How many ways can a man say no.
Go on. Have another try at him.	What's the use.
Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?	Since I can remember, Ma'am.
Would you like to learn them?	I sure would.
You're so nice.	Did someone say I wasn't nice?
And that's tough, isn't it?	Without someone to teach you, it's tough.
Are you okay?	Yeah, I'm fine. I just broke up with my boyfriend, that's all.
Help!	Now, why that bitch gotta bring that shit this way? I hope she didn't see me.
Oh my God! We're dead!	It would've just been you, if you would've kept your mouth shut.
Ray, run faster.	Okay.
But, hey, maybe we can be friends.	Sure, that would be cool. Friends.
He's here.	Shit!
What are we gonna do? I'm cold. I can't move, I'm so cold.	Can you feel that?
There's something I really want to share with you.	There's something I want to share with you too. Here, smell this.
What should we get?	I don't care. You pick.
Are you okay?	I think so.
Okay, I get the point.	So, whatever happened to her?
Come in somebody. Can you hear me?	This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
Ray, you saved my life. Are you okay?	Yeah, I broke my fall.
Would you like me to help you pass them back?	I don't need your help.
What the hell are you doing?	Just wait, you'll see.
Father!	My child, you're alive!
I'm sorry.	Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
So, do you think you made it into the class?	I don't know, but I sure hope so.
Did you do that?	Uh, uh.
I take it you're not mad at me.	I wouldn't go that far.
Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.	Saw who?!
She's right. We should stick together.	Alright. Come on, you guys.
You mean to tell me we're dead!	I guess so.
Remember, don't ask her too many questions.	Because she will lie?
Oh shit, you gonna take that?	What?
No thanks.	My holy water.
Father, I think you should rest.	No, I'm fine.
Yo son, check this out.	Dog, you look hot.
"Ray!"	"Fucked me."
Did you hear?	What happened?
Here we go again.	He's really cute!
DAD! YOU DON'T THINK SHE DID IT??!	I DO! Mom's gone crazy!
I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.	I'm so happy I could shit.
Goodnight, honey.	Don't I get a kiss?
Did you see her?! She just said "Fuck you" to me!	Let the record show I'm just standing here.
I don't like this.	Which room is it?
You scared?	Yes.
We can't stand here all night.	You could go and open the door.
How much does she want?	She could use a hundred dollars.
I haven't got that much in cash.	How much have you got?
What did she want?	I did her hair.
Thank you. It was a lovely dinner.	Good.
This is about another murder  a woman at Fifty Second Street	But you do believe me?
She's got to be found. That's the first step. She's got to be found so that she can give herself up to the police.	We've tried so long to find her.
Do you think he knows about this?	I don't know.
Could you find him?	I suppose so. I can pick him up somewhere.
Let her know what?	That you love Mary.
She'll have to know some time.	Not from me.
You'll be all right?	Yes.
What was she to you?	I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
If you like, I'll go with you to dinner.	I'd like that.
Would they hurt her?	I don't know.
But you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister.	I'm afraid not.
I'm afraid not.	That's too bad.
I'm worry to bother you. I want to ask you about my sister.	Yes?
Do you have other things?	Yes.  Oh, you mean to bring in! No. Yes, I have some other things, no, I don't need to bring them in. This is all I need to stay here.
Have you ever been on television?	Television?
This food is excellent.	Thank you.
Would you mind?	No.
Yeah, I know. I mean, I'm not saying I know people think you're a bitch, I'm saying I know what you mean. And I don't even know that people think you're a bitch. Do they?	I feel like they do.
So what about kids?	Kids? What about them?
So what's your personal thing? Are you really going to tell me something personal?	Do you want me to?
Do you think that's such a good idea?	Don't you want to make one?
Do you talk to him?	When we're making love?
Is he going to see this?	Absolutely not.
Did you have sex before you were married?	Yes.
If you were in love with me, would you?	I'm not in love with you.
I can't.	Why not?
Don't do that.	Why not?
I want to touch you.	No.
Yes. I just got busy.	That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message.
You son of a bitch!!	Not very often.
I have thought about it, yes.	You bitch. I knew it.
God damn you!!	Yes.
When did you begin having this feeling?	About a week ago. I don't know what brought it on, I just started feeling like I didn't want him to touch me.
I hate my sister.	Why?
Here it is.	What is it?
Thank you.	Well. I can't stay.
Do you have my work number?	No.
I get real busy between two and four.	Okay.
Bye.	Bye.
Did he ask me to take my clothes off? No, he didn't.	Did you take your clothes off?
Oh, okay. I think I get it.	What do you get?
Hello.	Hi.
Look, I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here, okay?	Okay.
No.	No? Not even one more?
John?	In here!!
Do you want me to stop calling?	Look, I'll call you, okay?
Plenty of room for two people.	It'll just be me.
Get rid of the car when you get your apartment, then you'll still have one key.	I like having the car, the car is important.
Give me your keys.	My keys?
Your keys, asshole!! Your two fucking keys!! Give them to me!!	I'm not going to give you my keys.
Hi.	Hi. Want a drink?
Anything wrong?	No. I don't think so.
Can I call you at the office?	What do you want to call me at the office for?
But you'll think about what I said about working together, huh?	OK. I'll think about it.
He didn't make it.	Huh?
NIGHT NIGHT	NIGHT NIGHT
You got it!	I got it!  I got it!!!
That's us.	I don't want to get up there.
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART	YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
Could I do that later?	Of course.
But they only think they're happy.	That doesn't make sense.
Oh my poor baby.	Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
You shouldn't have said that.	Why?
I NEED SOME	YOUNG BLOOD
No!  He's never done that before.	Good!  Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.
Our field.	What does he know about it?
And none of them worked?	No.
Isn't she lovely?	Mommy and Daddy love you, Baby.
You don't think I fuck you, bitch? I'll fuck you.	I'm a bad girl. I'm a bad girl.
You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?	I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
Don't bother him with that. We got to get going.	It'll just take a second.
Are you there? Miles?	Yeah, I'm here.
How's it hanging, Miles?	You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
You okay, Miles?	I'm good.
How you doin' tonight, beautiful?	Good. How're you?
I can explain.	You said you loved me! You fuck! I hope you die!
Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?	She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
That's what you do with every one.	When do we get to drink it?
You know, you could work in a wine store.	Yeah, that would be a good move.
Hey Jack, hurry up!	Just a minute!
Nice, huh?	Beautiful.
Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!	I want to go home now.
We're on.	What?
Pull yourself together, man.	I'm fine!
Where were you?	Bathroom.
You should call her.	I will.  See ya!
Nice shot.	You're an asshole.
What about your agent? Hear anything yet?	Nope.
Don't come over the top. Stay still.	Shut up.
Is it the money thing?	Is what the money thing?
We're on.	What's happening?
Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is yo' daddy?	Put me down, Jack.
What's it look like to you?	Looks like you were in a bad car accident.
You know what I'm thinking?	What's that?
We gotta go back.	What?
She tell you she was married?	Yeah.
Fuck you. I'll get it myself.	Hold on.
Want me to drive?	No, I'm okay.
Come on, let me drive.	I'm fine. You rest.
What the fuck!	You said it looked like a car accident.
Look at this!	I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
You broke some.	Whatever. Sorry.
Well. That about does it.	Why don't you come in?
Love you, man.	Back at you.
You want to join us?	Sure.
So how's that book of yours going, Miles? I think you were almost done with it last time we talked.	I finished it.
Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack.	See you.
Hi.	Hey.
Bathroom over there?	Yeah.
Were you ever going to say anything?	Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth.
I've told him. I've told him over and over, but he's out of control.	Do you know what he's been saying to her?
Hello?	Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
Sir, what are you doing?	I told you I need a drink.
Where's Jack?	He had to make a phone call.
Hi, guys. We should probably get going.	Where?
What are you thinking about?	Why do you talk to mom when you're by yourself?
It makes me feel better.	Does she ever answer back?
Daddy.	Don't touch him.
I don't want you to die.	Who said I was going to die?
I'm scared.	Me too.
Does it hurt?	I don't feel much.
It was very dark.	Yes it was.
It was very dark.	Yes, it was.
Should we turn off the lights?	They already know we're here.
He was only a year and half old.	What are you doing?
We won't be able to get out of there.	I'm sorry I hurt your arm.
I can feel air.	Me too.
That's good enough for me.	Me too.
I'm getting out now.	Don't do it.
Did someone save me?	Yeah baby. I think someone did.
Second thing this week I can't explain.	What was the first thing?
I don't think so.	Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
Is anything missing?	No.
Is that him?	Yeah.
I'd get down if I were you. They may be up there now.	No money, eh?
All I did was kiss a girl.	That's why they got you in jail?
I think we lost 'em.	There's nobody coming?
Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and kids.	Your next water ain't for three days.
I didn't know you were out.	Did it seem short to you?
This was my father's. The men who killed him took it.	I'm sorry.
I gotta get to my brother. If they came after me, they'll want him too.	You'll never make it.
I'll go. I'll bring Jake out here.	Be careful. You're in it now. And it's gonna get mean.
I almost didn't.	Where's Jake?
Gotta go.	Right.
More than enough.	Have you thought at all about your plans?
I'm surprised to see you out here tonight.	I just came out to say goodbye.
I'm just meeting a guy here and moving on. So far I haven't been able to find him.	In my town, when you're looking for someone, you ask me.
Maybe I ought to throw you in jail too. Then you could be with all your friends.	I haven't done anything.
Doesn't look quite fair.	Which way do you mean?
You'll have to deal me out on that. I've had some experience with that sort of thing, and I don't want any more.	I understand.
A lot of men have told me that. Maybe it's true. I guess some women are slow to believe it.	Believe it.
Where's your brother?	He'll be here.
This a friend of yours?	He is now.
Get out of here, Jake.	All I did was kiss the girl.
New record.	Let's get out of here.
What are you talking about?	I'm done talking. Get out.
Why him?	Shut up. You need help, don't you?
I got there just short of too late.	Lucky.
He must be pretty good.	He's good, all right. Too good for my men. That's why you've got to take care of it.
You got a place to stay?	I just got to town.
Easy, boy. Just an idea.	Well, thanks, but forget it.
What is it you want from me?	Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
I'm going to have to look into this.	Yeah, maybe I will too.
You work here?	I run the place. What can I get you?
What's this?	That's the good stuff.
Where's the dog now?	He left me.
What is it that I can't figure?	What do you mean?
What makes you say that?	If he didn't you'd never sit still while this was happening.
How about you?	I don't want you to get hurt.
I've got a place I can hide her.	You better get in there with her until this thing is over.
Sorry I didn't get her back in time.	No problem.  Do you want to come in?
She was there.  She didn't by any chance happen to mention me?	She said you were very beautiful.
No, I'm okay.	Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
You have to see her.	I've seen them all before.
Hi, Dad.	Hello, sweetheart.
Can't you stop that?	Why?
You love her, don't you, Max?	Don't you?
It's a hotel.	I don't understand.
A lot's happened since we last saw each other.	Yes.
Would you like me to read?	Yes, I'd like that.
You know you're really very good. I take back what I said.  I mean, you're really good.	Thank you.
You mean they buy it?	Buy it?  They're paying for it. And around here that's how you really know they buy it.
Wow. They called you their son.	We can keep it in the bathroom.
Are you calling me?	What? You don't see enough of me at the store?
Why did you leave me?	I didn't leave you.
I just needed to do a couple of things.  And I needed to tell you something.	Tell me.
That's very sweet. I'm okay.	Do you think I should stop by on my way back? Show you what I got? It's not a problem.
I'm going to see you again, right?	If it's okay with you?
You ever tell her about how it is with Tommy?	I don't tell her a thing.
What'd you write?	Words.
I didn't know you were funny.	I forgot myself.
What makes you think that?	Your eyes told me.
When they get mad, it gets cold.	Them?
Can I ask you then?	Yes.
I have to.	When?
Something happened, didn't it?	Yes, it did.
I believe both of you now.  And I think I might know how to make them go away.	You do?
She came a long way to visit me, didn't she?	I guess she did.
I wish I were somewhere else.	Where will you go, where no one has died?
Don't go home, okay?	I definitely won't.
I think we said everything we needed to say.  Maybe it's time to say things to someone else? Someone close to you?	Maybe.
They're right here.	Oh.
You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again?	Don't get mad.
You know that accident up there?	Yeah.
You can see her?	Yes.
Where is she?	Standing next to my window.
I don't like people looking at me like that.	Like what?
Excuse me?	You talked funny when you went to school here. You talked funny all the way to high school!
Maybe you don't want to remember.	What are you talking about?
I'd watch your step if I were you, son.	Oh yeah? Why's that?
You'll be back.	I don't think so.
Throw me one.	Not while you're driving.
What the fuck you talking about, man?	He's right. You were behind.
Yeah. That's just the problem.	Tell me you checked the bus before we left, Carl.
My father and I don't exactly see eye to eye.	About what?
Carl.	CARL??? Carl did this?!!
Shit.	Bill, we need to talk!
Grant, where'd you go?	Hey, Grant.
Bill, I heard what you're doing. I think I should go along.	Why? Listen, it doesn't matter. I gotta go.
What are you doing?!	We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.
Where are you?!	We're coming your way, man!
What?	Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.
I think we best get you to a hospital right quick.	What the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, Bill?
You're lookin' awful pretty.	Shut up.
Sure thing, killer.	What can I do you for?
What are you doing?	You're pretty.
Where'd he go?	We ain't never gonna find that girl now.
Get your hands off my daughter!	Your what?
So tell me about yourself.	Okay.
Guess what?	I give up.
Can I ask you something?	Shoot.
Well?	We lost him.
What the hell are you doing?!?	He's after us again!
You know this guy, don't you?	I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out.
Where did you learn how to drive like this?	Like what?
I'm proud of you.	Yeah?
What are you gonna do when you get home?	Sleep for a week.  Wanna join me?
Why should I?	Because I need your help, sweet thing.  And I need it bad.
Order up!	That's me.
Sure I can't interest you in anything else?	Another time.
How long's this gonna take?	I don't know, man. Ask him?
Never mind. It's nothing.	Anything else you don't want me to know?
Have any trouble getting here?	About one to five years worth.
Are you on a land line?	Yeah, why.
What'd you say?	I said I got his machine.
You have to give me your word you won't come in.  Then I'll come out.	All right.
They shouldn't let people like you into space.	Just so you know: I'm not going back until I understand what it is.  I am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then I will go home.
You killed her!	Not her.  It.
She'll come back.	No, she won't.
Is there anybody else here?	Why, who did you see?
How much sleep do you need?	How much sleep?
What will you say?	To who?
What's wrong with you?  We need your help.	I won't be making the trip.
Don't.	Why?
We're taking a flight?	Yes.
You want to fuck her?	Stop it.
What do you remember?	What do you mean?
What happened?	You were trying to break down the door.  Do you know why?
Where've you been?	I been thinking about how much I hate you.
What happened to us, exactly?	You don't know?
Why did you say those things?	I don't know.  I couldn't understand why you didn't tell me.
Do you have any idea how much I like fucking you?	I think so.
You sure say "God" a lot when we're doing it.	I know.  I'm putting that in my next report.
What's wrong.	You don't love me.
I'm sure there are worse people to talk to, but I don't know who they are.	I'm just trying to understand what's going on.
Can you sleep?	I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me.
Do you want to stay here?	Do you?
What's happening to us?	It's all right.
That won't happen again.  We're different.	How can I tell?  You've seen both of me.  I only know what you're like here.  You're all I know.  There is no "You" from before.
What do I have to do to stop it?	I want you here.
What does it want?	I don't know.  Something.  Anything.
Where did you go before?	When?
He won't do it.	Why do you say that?
Are you nervous?	No, Ma'am.
Would you pick one out, please?	Beg pardon?
Put it on my account, please.	I got money.
You all right?	Yeah.
So, this could be your last night, huh?	Could be, I guess.
Good night, Mike.	Sleep good.
Stop, will you?!	Let go!
You told her?	Not exactly.
What a memory.	Do you dance?
It wouldn't work.	I know.
How long you going away for?	Long enough.
So.	So.
Say goodbye, Mike.	You take care.
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?	Sure we are, let's go!
Mom, what's going to happen with you and Dad?	I don't know Tommy.
Mike?	What?
Bought it.	It's not your taste.
Coming to bed?	Few minutes.  Want to catch the news.
I'm going to visit my sister for a few days.  I'd like you to get your stuff out.	What about Tommy?
He doesn't want to sleep here.  Neither do I.  It's not my house anymore.	Me neither.
What do you think?  Any chance?  There's nothin' else I'm any good at, but this.	Call me next week.  We'll talk about it.
How do I know that's her?	I'll bring her in.  You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
Under the table.	I'll take his place, all right?  Put the gun to my head.
Watch your step!	What the fuck you doin'?!
How do you know where the gun is?	I know where everything is.
How are things going, pal?	Okay, I guess.
I was there.	See?
Eh.  Week from tomorrow.	How about tomorrow?
Maybe I was hiding.  For years, I never told Ben the one important thing.	He knew.
No.  I was lying about the coffee.	Thank God.
My my.	Yeah.  Really gets to you if you let it.
Need any more help?	No, thank you.  I'm sure you've got your own problems.
What's wrong with him?	Plenty.
Ready?	Roger.
What's the matter? You on their team now? You think I'm the guy?	I don't know anymore.
Break it off!	How much more do we have to take from him?
That's the general idea.  Only it's not so general as far as I'm concerned.	You are talking crazy!
Let me go! Let me go!	They'll shoot you, Animal!
No, Animal.	No?
Easy, Animal! Easy!	Where'd that come from?
I'll open mine now.	I'll open mine, too.
May I have this dance, Miss?	Why, sure!
You must get out. For your own good, you must get out.	Come on, everybody!  Let's go!
I'll make it five hundred!	No! No!
It's working.	Where is he?
I get it. I get it.	You get what?
Well, may we have a look around?	Please, please.
Beautiful day, isn't it?	Yes, yes, it is.
No, no, it's not. It's better.	Better?
Keep her together until I get back.	I always do.
Sir?	Make it so.
Captain, are you all right?	Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.
How many more?	Just him, sir!
Yes, Admiral. But that may not be possible.	What? What are you saying?
Gentlemen. Good evening.	Good evening, Commander. Everything ready?
You okay, Jim? How do you feel?	Young. I feel young, Doctor.
David was right, wasn't he? It's just to keep them busy.	Why? Why didn't you tell me?
David. Please.	This is just to give us something to do, isn't it?  Come on.
I was wrong about you. And I'm sorry.	Is that what you came here to say?
What are you looking at?	The Admiral's son.
What are you looking at?	I don't know.
There's a first time for everything, Admiral.	To be sure, Captain.
They knew just where to hit us.	WHO? Who knew just where to hit us? And why?
Yes.	Take the test again.
Time!	Three minutes, thirty seconds.
How're you doing?	Fine. Just fine.
You just said there aren't any except on Earth of the past.	That is what I said, Doctor.
All right, Commander, you wanna tell us anything?	Like what?
You sure you won't change your mind?	Is there something wrong with the one I have?
Memory problems, too.	Uh huh. What about you? Where you from?
What's that?	What's what?
With pleasure.	Well, that's different.
My father told me I shouldn't talk to you.	I understand.
I have to go home now.	Bye.
I don't think they believe us.	Why not?
I wish there was a way to bring them back home.	Ask them.
Why would we be involved with these people?	Good question.
Ready to make a little history?	Always am.
You seem to have an answer for everything.	Something wrong with that?
Take care of him. He's a very special man.	Yes, he is.
What?	You're lying.
Good luck, sir.	I'll keep in contact. You have the Bridge.
Return to our own time?	Yes, sir.
Report!	We've lost Bridge control!
Good luck, Captain.	I'm going too. They may need a doctor.
Or not to be -	That's the question -
What is it with you, anyway?	Still think we're finished?
I've always wanted to meet you, Captain.	I'm not sure how to take that.
Are those your words?	Yes.
What took you so long?	Kill him! He's the one!!
I hope you're happy.	Captain.
Do you know who I am?	You are me.
Do you know where you are?	I am in a room with lights.
Can you remember our father?	No.
No.	I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?
If you wouldn't mind.	Thank you.
May I have this dance?	With pleasure, Captain.
I'm going to miss you.	And I you.
How can you be certain?	I know how he thinks.
But how can he? He'll kill you.	This isn't about me anymore.
I'll always be with you now. Now and forever.	You sick bastard!
What's he doing?	He wants to look me in the eye.
He thinks he knows exactly what I'm going to do.	Sir?
To find the head, sir?	If you don't mind.
No!	Captain!
You don't trust me.	I have no reason to.
How long?	A matter of hours now.
What did I tell you?	Probably kids.
Do you have children?	No.
What do you think of America?	It is beautiful.
No!!! No!!!	He's got a gun!!
Where did you stop last?	What the hell do you think you're doing?
It's real, George.	There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure?
We'll need a lot of help, George. You could hide an army up here.	I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need.
No deal.	I'm afraid we can't let you go.
I won't let anyone hurt you.	Watch it. They're coming out.
What?	What.
Which way?	That way.
Money.	Money.
No gas.	No gas.
What?	Not what. Who. What is for things.  What? What? What? What? For people you use who. Who is he?  Who is she?  Who are you?  Who am I?
That's a big help. Where are you from?	From?
Gas.	Closed.
No gas.	I know.
Shit.	Shit?
Money.	Yes.
What's the matter?	Shit!
What?	Music.
I will see it next time.	You better.
When do you have to be here?	I do not understand.
Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car.  That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go.	When we get here.
Don't be afraid. Do what I told you and you'll be okay.	Yes.
Goodbye.	What?
What happened?	I was afraid.
What are you doing?	Are you my friend?
Nobody knows.	Why?
Do you have music up there?	Yes.
Put that back.	But I have never seen this before. I am not complete.
You shouldn't drink so much of that stuff. It's bad for you.	On the radio they say it's good.
The machine gave me two. Should I put one back?	No. Get in.
Are you angry at me?	No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.
Where are you going?	I must meet my ship.
Asshole!!	Where did you learn that?
We're not going to get a ride tonight.	I can't stay on this planet.
What are you saying?	You can stop. I will go on alone.
You are cold.	You're damn right I am.
What?	Nothing.
They are beautiful.	Yes, they are.
There.	Where?
I love you.	I'm never going to see you again, am I?
Tell the baby about me.	I will.
Help me!!	You could have killed us both!!
Help me!!!	Hey, she doesn't want to go with you. Come on.
They after you?	What? No, of course not.
I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you.	Don't worry. I'll be all right.
Tell him I'm not here.	I did.
Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a living?	I don't understand.
Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?	Watch and see.
I don't feel anything.  Is it on?	Forget it's there.
Jesus.	Yeah.  So don't walk near me in public, alright.
You just did.	Jesus!
What the fuck are you doing?	Coming with you.
Are we having a bad night?	Let's talk in the car.
I need my case.  It's still in the back.	Get it.
Forget her.	She still loves me.
And gives it to you.	Wants to share.
Where we going?	Anywhere.  We'll talk about it in the car.
What is it?	This tie doesn't go with blue!
Are you out of your fucking mind?!	Fire's out, isn't it?
Those two guys were cops.	You sure?
Tell me.	I can't tell you.  You've got to see.
We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance.	You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
Take it to him.	A cop?  You want me to trust a cop?!
Oh boy.  What if you're wrong?	Then we'll be right where we are now.
Jesus.	Hi. What's in the case?
My God.	Not bad, huh?
Calm down, Harold.  Okay, here's what we're going to do, Harold: there's a pull off up ahead, we're going to stop there.	Oh God, mister, please leave me alone.
I've been looking for you.	Why me? What do you want from me!?
There was a car in the lot when we closed. Gone today.	What kind?
I think I talked to him.	Who?
Is he dead?	Yeah.
Don't do it, Mike.	Shut up.
Do you realize that I've been waiting for that call for six months and I cut her off?	You're money, baby.
Hi.	Hi.
Charles! What's up, man?	Oh. You know.
Hi.	My pleasure.
Let me just check on my boy.	Don't worry. He's in good hands.
Oh my God.	Did you get it?
He's so sweet. He really said that?	I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.
On the table.	Sorry?
Hello?	Hi, Mike?
Hi. Sorry about that.	You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back.
And what if I don't want to give up on her?	You don't call.
Thanks, man.	No problem, buddy. You eat anything today?
You want to talk about it?	What's the point?
How's it going for you two?	Not well.
He's a bitch. He ain't gonna do nothing.	You asshole.
I'm so sorry, man. You were so right. I got rid of the gun	What are they doing here?
Good for you, man. He's being smart.	She's really special, guys.
I can't lose more than a hundred.	Just bring your card. Half an hour.
That's where we make our scene.	You think they're watching?
Double down.	What?!?
What an asshole.	That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
No, man. I need to use the phone.	What?
She asked me what I was thinking about? What should I have done? Lie?	You didn't have to get into it, baby.
No.	Yeah.
How you guys doing?	It's on.
What are you doing?	What?
Was I money?	I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
You're not just, like, fucking with me?	No, baby!
How long do I wait to call?	A day.
So, two days?	Yeah. I guess you could call it that.
Because he's a bitch.	That's so bullshit. This is so bullshit.
Is she looking at me, baby?	No.
Yes she did.	Damn. Now I gotta go in early.
That was pretty cold, dude.	What was cold about it?
It's on.	You think?
The food is on the table.	I'm not hungry yet.
You heard about your father?	Yeah.
Outside.	Sure.
I'll think about it.	Drive while you thinking; I wanna get to the City this month!
You think we'll go for that last place?	Maybe, or you gotta know now.
You take care of your family?	Sure.
Will your girl friend get back to the city all right?	Tom said he'd take care of it.
Have you thought about a wife?  A family?	No.
You tell us about America.	How do you know I come from America?
You look wonderful, kid; really wonderful.  That doctor did some job on your face.	You look good, too.
Ever seen anything like that before?	No.
Who are those girls?	That's for you to find out.
What was that?	An accident.  No one was hurt.
Will you give this letter to Michael.	Mama, no.
Sure.  Anything I can do for you.	No.  I guess I'll see you Christmas. Everyone's going to be out at Long Beach, right?
Michael, what are those men doing?	They're waiting to see my father.
I never know when you're telling me the truth.	I told you you wouldn't like him.
Michael?	I'm thinking about it.
When will I see you again?	Goodbye.
Your sister wants to ask you something.	Let HER ask.
Michael, it's not true.  Please tell me.	Don't ask me.
Where are you going?	To the city.
What is it?	Is it all right if I go to the bathroom?
Mike, good to see you.  Got everything you want?	Thanks.
I wanted to tell you my plan.	So tell me.
That ring's so great. The green one.	Tom, I love you!  See!  I bought it for him, for his birthday.
Are you okay?	Sure.
Very.	And you, sir? Any better?
I told you. He gave them to me.	Why? When?
What's your secret?	Excuse me?
Show me the other one again.  I like them both.	I'll take them both.
C'mon, I need to talk to you. Just the two of us.	Okay then, you're crazy.
Will we see you later?	I can't later.
Are you okay?	I'm fine.
Tom, are you okay?	You try. You try talking to her.
Ask me what I want to change about this moment.	What do you want to change about this moment?
How was it?	Good. But I think we should stay in here for the rest of the trip.
Can we go up? Do you mind?	Of course. What happened to your face?
You like ball games?	Huh?
Damn.	What's wrong?
Where are you going?	I'm leaving.
What about the record?	Keep it.
Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere.	With who?
Yeah.	Could you see anything?
Hello.	You looking for some action?
What's your name?	Easy.
Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?	Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it! Fuck it!	You can do it in my mouth.
Well, I tried.	I understand, mister. It means something, really.
Are you a Secret Service Man?	Why do you ask?
Who?	Oh, lots. I don't know where they all are now. There used to be one standing over there. 
Is it hard to get to be a Secret Service Man?	Why?
Get it.	Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here. This don't make any sense.
What's the action around?	Slow.
Had a close one.	You want to talk about it?
Not really.	You know how I feel about what you do.
He says he's leaving the island sir.	Don't let him do that.
I'll go.	Wrong.
Surprise, surprise.	I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break.
Hi.	Hi.
You'll stand by me?	Whatever happens.
I think  it's worse  now.	That always used to work.
You can all go home, now.  He's not going anywhere.	Go on home, folks.  And thanks for the welcome.
City hall?	You must not remember anything. Come on.
You first.	Why me?
So, you're really gonna be a lawyer?	And why not?
What was that?	Nothing.  
This is strange.  Do you feel it?	What?
Here we are.	Well, son, you're home!
Wait'll you see the inside!	Can't wait.
We've been closed for a while.	Ah.
Beautiful, wasn't it?	Yes.
Thanks, Jerry.  Tell me something.	What.
Any idea how you got here, son?	No, sir.
Here, one of mine.	Thanks.
You kids off to the dance?	Aren't you coming?
You smell gas?	Don't smell nothin'.  He must not be dead in here.
You think he's drunk somewhere?	Wouldn't blame him if he was.
Her name was right there in front of them.  They gave it to me, I didn't give it to them.	Well, that's not what they think.
Please, sit.	Thanks.
What happened?	What exactly did you hear?
You hungry, son?	Yes.  Very.
Oh, hi!  Did you find her all right?	Yes, I did.
Do you think I should go?	That's up to you.
Is anyone there?	Look.
Yes, I did.	Just listen to them!
Good morning.	Morning.
How much for the phone calls?	It's nothing.
I can handle it.	I know you can.  But I'd like to.
That's the last of it.	Did you close the door?
I wonder if you could help me.	What?
Why did he shoot her?	He was watching a ball game on television.
You'll be able to find your way back, won't you?	Oh, yes.
I'd still like to see you.	Why?
Are you all right?	Yes.
It's so damn quiet out there.	It was like that yesterday.
Do you want to try your father again? 	I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
When will they stop?	I thought they'd have stopped by now.
There we are!	Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
How do you plan to do that?	With smoke.
I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.	Then let's go. Now!
I'm leaving! Are you coming?	All right, all right!  Hope you figure this out, folks.
I fear he may have to.	But can't you give me any idea?
You asked to see me, ma'am?	I want you to help my little girl.
You have his promise, then?	Yes.
He's not home.	Where can I find him?
Where shall we put it? In the back?	No room there. We'll have to set it between us.
This is not a woman!	It was a woman when we put her in.
Are you a doctor, too?	Not yet.
I thought this was a school day.	I am not at the school anymore. I left last night.
I will not have you use that name to me.	You will not have it?
Can anyone hear what we say?	Only Brother.
I hate that picture.	Where are they?
around, or whatever the hell you're doing here.  What are you doing here?	I'm looking for my friends.
Two down. Two to go.	"Down?" Wait, don't tell me.
Wrong. Answer.	Who are you?
What did they give you?	They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."
Are you out of your fucking mind? We're going to die.	How can you die if you're already dead?
I was a friend of your sister's.	I know her friends.
Yeah, no kidding.	Your father gave them to both of you.
This is where it happened. Right over here.	Yeah, I know.
This tree. Here's where it happened.	I don't want to see!
Why are there so many?	Just hold on to me.
You're in with them.	It's not what you think.
They killed her because she found out.	About you.
Go to bed, darling. You can finish that in the morning.	Okay.
He gave these to you?	Well, not exactly. I gave him two dollars.
Boy, I'll bet he's strong. I bet he could knock down a whole building.	I shouldn't be at all surprised.
Go to the movies.	All right.
He's not there.  But look what I found in his room	Is it real?
You'll feel different when you see my picture in the papers.	I feel different right now.
What happened?	What time is it?
You sure about that?	Would you like to sell it?
All day.	Can't stand light?
Why not?	He's my brother.
They're looking at us.	They're gonna book us.
Good.	That's just the way we like it.
Where is she?!	Hey, take it easy.
Where you going?	For a ride.
C'mon, Michael.  I want to go.	No.  Stick around.
Look.	You're almost one of us now, Michael.
You can't kill me, Star.	I will, David!
Of course not!	If you're telling the truth, it means we can save you.
I said, I'll take you there. Nobody's going near Star without me.	Okay, okay.
You didn't tell David?	No.  Just you.
You like Michael.	I like Michael.
Still mad at me?	For what.
Michael, are you still in bed?	No.  I'm up.
Okay?	Okay.
Sure.	Does that mean we are, or we aren't?
Max is coming for dinner, Michael. I'd like you to meet him.	Can't.  Got plans of my own.
Tell them to get something to eat.	I thought we were poor.
Help me, Mom.  Help.	Soon.
Sam.  Is everything all right?	Mom.  I think we've got to have a long talk about something?
Where's Michael?	He's already gone to bed.
Can I sleep in here with you tonight?	In here?
Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.	I hope so.
What's your name?	Star.
Are you hungry?  Wanna get something to eat?	Okay.
I have to talk to you.  Please wake up.	Have to sleep.  Have to sleep, Michael.
I have to talk to you.  Can I come up?	Okay.
It's gone.  I feel it!	So do I!
This room is mine.	I was here first.
You're beautiful.	Wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face.
Michael?	Don't turn on the light.
We've got to stick together, Sam. You've got to help me.	What about Mom?
What do you want from us?	Just listen.
Maybe dinner.	Dogs don't eat each other.
That night?	Yeah.
What the hell you looking at me like that for?	Nothing.  Nothing at all.
What you doin'?	Nobody's getting in here.  You can tell them all that!
How you doin', old boy?	I don't know who to trust.
What?	Don't walk behind me.
Let's open it.	Hell no.
I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.	That's good enough.
What we going to do?!	How the fuck do I know?!
I think so.	What do you mean "you think so?"
Maybe we shouldn't make it.	If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
What are you doing?	Could be important work.  Might as well bring it back.
Would that test have worked?	I think so.
I guess you're okay.	Thank you.
How many in their party?	Started with six.  There'd be four others left.
Right.  Why not?	What's that?
Put that down!	No.
You're not thinking of going after them, are you?	I am going after them.
How long's it been?	Little over two hours.
What kind of test?	I'm sure a lot of you already know.
What is it?	Everything that's been missing.
Maybe it ain't coming.	Then we go after him.
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.	Who else could have used that key?
You hear that?	Hear what?
Now how did you get hurt?	I had an accident.
How can they just go back to work as if nothing happened?	What else can they do?
No one ever comes here.  My mother told me stories about it late at night.  They tell all the children.	What kind of stories?
Yes.  Just about here.	But there's nothing here.
Because you'll never die.	Excuse me?
When was his mother taken?	Last night.
So, do we go on?	Yes.
It's what they want you to see.	This is the way in?
What?	Go back to where you came from.  Or die here.
You're late.	Got here as soon as I could.
You're late.	Got here as soon as I could.
In the future, we'll be better.	What?
Yes.	Thank you.
Why?	Why not?
Is he all right?	Just a dream.  You should sleep too.  You're still not well.
Good night, then.	Good night.
Yes, sir.	Very good.  Now if you will excuse us for a moment.
Where do they take them?!	We don't know.
What did you do at night?	What's it like where you come from?
I wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she's in for?	For our sake, I hope not.
I don't know what to tell you, sir. He's been gone this whole week.	And you've no idea where he went?
Sir?	I'm glad he's gone.  Maybe he's finally found a place where he can be happy.
You ok?	I'm fine.
I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there.	In where?
Relax.	Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
And what's that?	My business?
Who are you?	I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
Did you know my father?	Oh yeah, sure. He killed a cop, right?
My father used to talk about you.	Oh yeah, what'd he say?
You done with your small talk?	Sure.
This is really happening, isn't it?	[Beat] What do you need me to do?
Your mom take anything before this happened?	Yeah, but I don't know what.
I looked it up.	How?
How long do we have?	I don't know.
They're not here.	They're not.
That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you.	No, he didn't.
Where are we going?	To the hospital.
You gotta stop thinking like that.	Then, where are you going?
I've been ok.	Good. How's your mom?
How you doin'?	I'm doing fine.
And if I didn't want to come?	I guess I'd ask you why.
You should be careful. You could be killed if they found you out here.	Believe me, I know.
My God you look exactly like him.	I never knew my father. Did you?
At the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things.	You thought my father was crazy?
How'd he get it?	[Beat] I don't know.
It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?	[Beat] Yeah, it is.
What do you mean?	You have no idea what's going on.
Why don't you help me?	Because I don't have time.
Can I get some paper and something to write with.	What for?
I'm not gonna let that happen.	You still don't believe me, do you?
You know how to get there?	Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
I tried to kill my wife.	Don't you go to jail for that?
What were you talking about the other day?	I wasn't talking about anything.
You ever been to jail?	No.
Hey, Mister, you need a ride?	Where are you going?
Can you drive?	Sure.
All right. [Beat] You got somewhere you need to go, Mister?	I'm not sure.
I'm not sure.	You don't have anywhere to stay?
Well, where are you from?	I'm not sure. [Beat] I don't really know.
You want a drink?	Sure.
Well, good for you.	[Beat] Why?
You don't think that's crazy?	Maybe. [Beat] Maybe not.
Honey?	Yes, baby?
I've been better.	You girls are in some hot water.
We're both fine.	Good.  You wanna tell me what happened?
Hey.	How are things goin' out there?
No!	You want to come on in?
This is serious, son.  A man is dead.	I know!  I'd tell you if I knew! Goddamn!  I know something happened, or she wouldn't have left.  I'm trying to remember everything!  Find that fucking kid.  He probably knows something.
Is this the guy you saw them with?	It's him.
Good God.	My Lord.
Oh shit.	What's wrong?
Don't.  I'm married.  I don't feel good.  I've been sick.	It's okay.  I'm married, too.
Tell me now.	Call me back.
Can I just ask you one other thing?	Maybe.
Is this your car?	Yes.
How much longer is it gonna be?  I'm hungry.	Another hour of so.  We've got enough food for a month.
Oh my God.	Get the car.
Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.	Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
Did you finish thinking?	I think better when I drive.
Call him?	Call him.  Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
What's wrong with you?	Nothing.  Why?  Do I seem different?
Drive!  Drive away!	What happened?
Now what?	Now what what?
Can I ask you kind of a weird question?	Yeah.
What?	Nothing.  It's not funny.
I told you to slow down.  Hell, Officer, I told her to slow down.	About how fast was I going?
Sorry!	Sorry!
Ready?	Hit it.
Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.	Are you alright?
I think I've really fucked up.  I think I've got us in a situation where we could both get killed.  Why didn't we just go straight to the police.	You know why.  You already said.
You know what's happened, don't you?	What?
Shit!	Did you see that guy?!  He was right in the middle of the road!
Shit!	What?!
Isn't it beautiful?!!	It's grand!
God!  It looks like the Army!	All this for us?
What?  What are you talkin' about?	You know good and damn well what I'm talkin' about.
You women are crazy!	You got that right.
Hi!	Hi there!  You alright?
Well then you've got to call her, man.	Fuck calling her. I'm going down there.
Well? What are you waiting for?	I don't know what to say.
Oh God, I'm fucking nervous. I don't know if I'm ready for this, man.	Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?
Why's that?	I'm usually too tired to be.
Bob, do you remember Mary?	Who?
I got twenty bucks says you're full of shit.	Oh come on, why would I lie?
Very nice.	I'm doing okay.  I gotta get ready for work.
Take it easy, that's Bill.	Tell Bill to get the fuck off!
Well, it was nice meeting you, again.	Same here again.
Don't you want to know my name?	I already know it, Mary.
Fine. Fine.	Here you go.  What's that smell?
Yeah.	Wow. I thought I was the only one.
Mary ah, forget it.	What?
I've got some very, very good news for you, my friend.	Really?  Very, very?
I think your life's about to change.	So you found Mary?
Look, uh, I've been thinking about everything you told me.	Good good.
Hey, hey, hey!	Surprised?
Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?	I don't know what you're talking about.
How many is that?	Four.
You little fuck.	What?
He's a nice guy, isn't he?	Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?
I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.	Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay.
Oh yeah. Fine.	Thanks a lot, Ted.
Hi, Ted.	Hi, Mary.
Ted, are you okay?	Just a minute.
By the way, how's he doing?	He's dead.
I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but the thing is I already have plans. How about tomorrow night?	Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years.  Don't make me wait another day.
Hey.	Hi, Ted.
Sure.	Oh great, I ran out.
It's too bad you don't live down here, Ted.	Yeah?
That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your books.	All right, let's go.
What what are you doing here?	You forgot your keys!
Get over here.	Really?
What seems to be the situation here? You shit yourself or something?	I wish.
Hey.	So what's up?
Good.	Where the hell are you?
Well, I'm not.	Then you'll call, right?
We're getting everyone together as fast as we can.	What does the letter say?
We gave so much to get here. I don't know. Sometimes I think what the hell did we do it for?	Because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else.
Slow down. Smell that?	Smoke.
The sun came up today.	Yeah.
I saw you out there. You want him to call you back, need you.	No. I'm glad I'm home.
How's my favorite President?	Busy. But you've got his heart.
Get back out there, kid. Remember to hit 'em hard.	What about you? Where are you going?
I was eating that.	No you weren't.
Should be here any minute.	Good.
Hey.	Hey. Nice tie.
What are you doing?	James Looks Twice?
Somebody was serious about doing this guy, that's for sure.	Ray.
I did.	Who the fuck is he?
Couldn't sleep.	Good.
He sent me to find ya. He says he's got information.	Let's go.
What did he say?	He said he doesn't know.
What was he saying?	Why should I tell you.
He's gone.	He hasn't left this place in twenty years. They got him.
No way. No fuckin' way.	How the hell do you know?
It isn't?	Well, it is. It is that, too.
I beg your pardon.	No, I beg yours. But I don't think you're right on that.
Two.	Two miles.
It never came up.	You let me make a fool of myself.
Let's make it at eight.	Make what?
Come on.	Where?
Danger?	. Yeah!
No.	What do you want?
You don't believe that.	Hardly ever.
What do you do when you come here?	I sit. I think. I play games.
Want to play the game?	How does it go?
You didn't mean it. You didn't think. You'd do anything to take it back.	That's three.
One more.	Your watch.
Looks like a tie.	Who's gonna win?
You weren't gonna say goodbye?	I was, later.
Well?	Well what?
Yes sir. I do, Sir.	Well?
If I could fly like you I'd have everything I want. If I could fly at all. I can't fly. I can't fly like that. Nobody can. Whatever it is, you've got it!	Not anymore.
THERE'S ANOTHER ONE UP THERE!	I GOT ONE COMING UP.
Don't WORRY!!!?   You've GOT it!!? Are you CRAZY?	Roger, I've got it.
No! Not again!	What are you talking about, we gotta go!
Is there something I should know?	Just relax.
You think you can stay up with us.	I think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
You ever done this before?	What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!
We did it!	Look, Ma, top of the world!
Come on, we're next.	What?
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.	Don't.
He's the best you have. He's going Top Gun!	Was.
Hear about Ice?	What now?
IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN.	NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.
OKAY, GOING UP. ICE, GO HIGH.	LOOK OUT!
I guess I owe you one.	You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
Figured it out yet?	Figured out what?
You won?!!!	Didn't everybody?
It was bad.	Bad?
Was going.  Now you are.	Me?
How do you feel?	All right.
What's wrong with this one?	He ain't got five kids to feed.
Where's yours?	Over there man.
What happened to number five?	Ah, shit.  You got me.  I ain't even married.  Now put your fucking hands in the air!
He had help.  From our side, sir.	I know that.
Kill him.	It's about goddamn time.
Bob?	What is it?
So, been married long?	Eight years.
HER!	Arrest that woman!
Shit!	C'mon!
I don't know.  Maybe.	Well don't.
Harry, what the hell is this?	Come on, let's go have that drink.
Where?	Up to the right.
Shit!	What is it?
I've got a lock!  There!	Come on!
Look at this shit.	What the hell is this?
Who is she?	Nobody.
You are somebody.  You're the man I love.	Bye.
What are you doing?	Some men just tried to kill me!
Not talk!  I said TALK!!	I'm not your wife.
I love you.	Right.  That's why you tried to kill me.
They'll be here any minute!  They'll kill you all!	What's he talking about?
I love you.	I love you.
I don't remember you.	What are you talking about?
Now what?	Jump!
Are you all right?  Are you still you?	I'm not sure dear?  What do you think?
You sure about this?	It's just up ahead.
Wait!	What?
You guys all set?	Ready as we'll ever be.
I'll bet you're sorry the college ever sent you up here.	Well, I'm scared, but I'm not sorry.
We're not going over there, right?	No.  We go straight.
Oh, Jesus!!	What the hell is going on?  I mean WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?!!
Fuck you!	Hey, I don't want spend the night out here!
That means we're gonna be out here, like, in the dark.	Great.  Thank you.
Shut up!  They got wind of something they don't like!	Oh shit!
We'll take your word for it.	Yeah.  Where's your truck?
You go north, I'll go south.	Right.
You're right, don't matter where they come from.	Right.  We need to be talking about what we're gonna do.
I'm gonna kick his ass!	I'm gonna help you.
I'm making the run to the Cat.	Like hell you are.
Damn it.  What the hell are they doing?  They're up to something.	I don't care what they're doing as long as they're doing it way over there.
Use the fucking bomb!	So, we get back on that rock and in three days we're dead anyway.
What the hell are you doing?!!	I GOT A GODDAMN PLAN!!
How's she doing?	She wants to lay down.  I'm a little worried.
Twenty.	Okay, ten dollars.
What's it doing?	Why do you all keep asking me?
It worked!  There they go!	LET'S DO IT!
Gimme back my bottle.	Let go of my hair.
Murder witness.	You're doing a murder case?
My mother find you?	That's right.
No.	"No," what?
I see: He'd walk out next month.	That's right.
No.	No? Then what did he say?
No.	I want you to kill for me.
Here he comes.	Here he comes.
Okay, that's it. I've had enough of the waiting room now.	Oh.
HE'S GONE.	What?
And no one found the ring?	No, sir, we did not.
Where is the ring?	Someone else has it now.
She lived alone.	She must have known someone.
Take a look at this.	She's wearing a ring.
James called me last night looking for you.	When?
Do you want to talk?	No, I want to smoke.
Where are you going?	No place, fast.  And you're not coming.
What are you doing?	Nothing.
I can't remember anything about last night. Is there something I should remember?	No, you should forget about last night.
You missed somethin', Ed.	I did? I didn't see anything.
What about James? Can't James help you? You two are so in love.	He's in love with a girl who's dead.  It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry.
Where were you last night? We were supposed to get together. You didn't show up.	You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.
I've got to see you.	Not now.
What the hell is wrong with you?	That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?
Shit, maybe he'll kill you.	What?
Can I take the car?	Sure honey, what's the hurry?
Good night, Mom.	Good night, sweetheart.
Who was that?	A friend from school.
Are you sure you're okay?	Yes.
Dad?	Yes.
DON'T MAKE ME DO IT.	NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
What are you doing?	Who am I?
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.	And no one will know the truth.
That's the call that I'm waiting for.	What does it mean?
I didn't do too well for you.	No, you did fine.
You sure you don't want me to stay on.	No. No. Thank you. You go home.
Yes.	Why?
Hi.	Hi. How are you doing?
What is it?	Thank you for seeing me.
Why don't you get some rest?	I've got to work.
Is it over?	No.
Thank you.	I have to talk to you.
We just can't do it anymore.  This is our chance to get away.	I'm going to see you get that chance.
Well, well, well. Huh?	Yeah.
I have to talk to you.	What do you want?
Okay. What do you do when you don't have a witness?	You use their witness.
What the hell are you doing here?	We got to talk.
Hey, there - open up!	Come on out!  We're friends!
Maybe they aren't too sure we're here.	They could be as curious about us as we are about them.
There's one - there's the other, and we're right between them!	So is the town, I notice!
What if it isn't over?	Maybe you should tell me your dream.
Yes.	I'll be there in three hours.
Does he have to stay here over night?	Absolutely.
Someone's coming.	What?
Time for sleep.	Say how they find their way back home.
Tomorrow night.	No.  Tonight.  It's important!
In my bed.	Your bed?
Home.	Home, that's right.
Yes.  It's a story.  A story for a movie.	Read me some?
You okay?	I'm fine.
Can I get you something to drink?	Coffee'd be nice.
Did we lose anybody?	Not yet.
He would have loved this.	Your father?
I'd have liked to have said goodbye.	He knows.
You may not like what you hear.	I can take it.
Carry on.	Yes sir.
There's still a way.	What do you mean?
Make us proud.	Yes sir.
Where's Mom?	I couldn't bring her down here until I knew you were safe.
Why don't you go and try some of that on?	Okay.
She isn't that old.	What do you mean?
You okay?	Yeah.  How'd you do.
I couldn't have done it without you.	Yes you could.  You did.  This is all you.  Nobody else.
Feels different doesn't it?	What?
You know, I never had friends like this.	Me either.
Yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move?	Like this!
Why'd you do it?	What's the difference?
Can we talk?	I guess.
Listen man, I think I have a problem.	We all have problems.
Goodbye Mom.  I'll be okay.	I know you will.
Jesus.	I can't watch this.
How ya doing?	Fine.
I feel like I got you into this.	Forget it.
No way!	Come on man, what'd they look like?
What'd you do?	I said "Sorry, wrong room" and walked away.
My parents don't do it anymore.	How do you know?  They might.
Who told you that?	My dad.
That's how he died you know.	Who?
What are they doing?	I can't make it out?
I can't go in there.	What are you talking about.
We'll do our best.  You're welcome to say goodbye.	He's a big boy.
Well, we thought we'd drop in and see if you were all still in one piece.	And, of course, we are.
What?!  What's happening?!!	You're officer of the watch, George.
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus.  Man I knew we shouldn't have gone.  I tried to tell you.  I tried to tell you.  You guys made me come!  You made me come!!	Will you shut up?  You sound like my fucking sister.
Yeah, well you're really gonna have some bad dreams if we find out you didn't.	That's enough.
Me, too.	Why would you do that?
What's your problem?	Why'd you jump?
Don't ever call me stupid.	Come on, he didn't mean anything.
They tell you that?	I figured it out.
Why, man?	I don't have to listen to this.
I don't.	You will if you wanna eat.  Right George?
What?	If it were only that simple, my young friend.  Read on, gentlemen. Read on.
We've got a problem.	What's that?
How long you been standing there?	Long enough.
What are we supposed to talk about?	You've gotta be kidding?
It's outta here!	Come on man.  Let's just talk about it.
Do you have something to say?	No.
I'm not gonna kill it.	You already have.  Now go on.  Do it.
No.	What makes you so sure it was one?
Yes, that's true.	Do you think this is funny?  Some kind of joke?  You lost six people out there.
And you didn't do anything about it?	No.  I didn't.
Easy for you to say.	What's that supposed to mean?!
Damn it, child! Now look what you made me do.	What I made you do, mama?
I'm scared, mama.	Why, honey?
I really do think it's the best night of my life.	We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.
You think he saw us?	Who knows, baby?
You ready for this?	We'll find out in a hurry.
How much we got left, honey?	Under a hundred.
Thank you.	You're welcome.
So. Is he any good?	No. Not yet he isn't.
That was good.	He heard everything we were saying.
What's this guy's problem?	Just go around him.
Shit.	Back up. Go out the other way.
Wait here. I'll be right back.	Where would we go?
Shut up, James.	So what's the problem?
Want some help with that?	Don't touch it.
Kind of a sign, you're saying.	In a sense.
You driving this car?	Excuse me?
Boy or girl?	As long as it looks like her, I don't care. You know what I'm saying?
You cold, James?	A little.
James.  Don't leave just yet. There's something I think you ought to see.	I'll miss my bus.
Is that really it?	That's really it.
Go ahead.	Really?
Thank you.	You're welcome.
Want me to get that?	Sure.
He didn't give his name.	Who?
Afraid so.	That's a big book you're writing.
How's that?	Well done, James.
The one that left you?	That's right. That one.
You're lying.	The hell I am.
You coming?	In a minute. Get us a table.
It's because you don't eat.	I eat.
You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?	Okay.
So what are you going to do?	Do?
Not have it.	No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
He told you.	He told me.
Did you tell Walter?	I told Walter.
I need a ride.	I'm your man.
He's writing his name in water.	What's that?
Walter?	Yes?
Who's that guy?	Her husband.
Do you get high, Sam?	Only when I'm working.
Holy shit. Are you serious?	As a heart attack.
What made you pull out that old thing?	I was thinking of you.
You doing okay?	Got a job at old Frank's place. His son runs it now.
One hundred and twenty feet.	What?
What are you doing?	This little table is one heavy bitch.
I've got some pictures.  Want to see?	No thanks.
I've got some good news.	What's that?
Aren't you glad?	When?
Something like that.	That was terrific.
See anything interesting?	Not yet.
What are you writing in that book?	It's my bird book.
Don't you have friends?	I have friends.
What's up?	Have a seat.
You don't know?	I have no idea.
Okay?	Okay.
Too much sun.	What?
You walked home.	Yes.
You knew her?	What?
You don't know?	Know what?
I'd keep away from him.	What?
People have the right to know.	If she's here tomorrow, I'll fucking kill her.
Yeah, like the bird.	Can I ask how old you are?
Walter.	Do you have many friends?
Walter?	Yes?
No.	I don't mind.
And how's your job?	The job's okay.
Walter, I'd like you to try something for me.	What?
Try it.	No fucking way.
You don't like coming here, do you?	It's okay.
How do you feel about that?	I don't feel anything.
How long is this going to take?	We have a few more minutes.
I don't know.	What did you think would happen?
Walter, we'll pick up here next time.	I want to talk about it now.
You're very late.	Sorry.
When did it all start?	You mean my problem?
Close your eyes.	What?
Who do you see?	I see my sister.
Don't ever do that again.	All right.
It's going to take time, Walter.	Time.
What?	Are you okay?
Want a ride?	I'm all right.
There's something wrong with this picture.	What picture?
You're quiet at work.	I'm just quiet.
Are you?	What do you think?
Something happened to you.	Yeah?
So?	What?
What's the problem?	You think I have a problem?
Tell me about it.	Maybe later.
Hey, there.	Hi.
Why do you want to know?	Because I like you.
Sorry.	What did you do to them?
I never hurt them. Never.	Twelve years in prison?
I've changed.	Why young girls, Walter?
You know, this is crazy.	What?
Maybe this isn't a good idea.	What?
You're scared.	I'm not scared.
We should live together.	Live together.
It's a bad idea.	I think it's a fucking good idea.
I don't even know how to live with myself.	Just think about it.
What's this?	What's it look like?
Thank you.	You're such an asshole.
Don't be scared, Walter.	I'm not scared.
Don't do that.	Do what?
What's going on?	Nothing.
I didn't sleep well.	Do you want to talk about it?
You okay?	Yeah.
I think you were worried about me.	That must be it.
Come on, man.  What else could it be?	Why bring it here?
You better not say you missed that.	Missed what?
SHIT!	Give me that!!
Hey!	Check this out.
How are you?	Fine. Can't you see so yourself?
And how long will you be away?	Four or five days.
Up until now, Dad, I've been the one who hasn't wanted to marry him.	It's the same thing. Goodbye, dear.
Well?	Well, what?
There's nothing much to laugh at.	And that's what I say, too. We could have all been killed.
Find anything?	No.
Are you feeling better?	I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.
I think that you might go and have a look yourself.	Yes, maybe that is better.
But you know it already. Why must I tell you?	So, you wonder why?
Then I'll see you later.	Okay. In a few minutes.
Good night, my love.	Good night. Tell me that you love me.
And what are we going to do now?	We'll try again.
Where is she going?	Ask her.
We have a radio like this, too.	No, not like this one.
Whose boat is that?	What boat?
Because I'm getting fat.	Oh, for Heaven's sake.
You have a lovely voice.	No I don't.
No I'm not.	Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
First thing that comes to your mind?	God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
You want to talk about the baby don't you?	Would you like to talk about it?
You liked Sister Paul?	She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.
It's like hiding from my mother when I was a little girl.	Where did you go?
What did you do?	I'm always bad.
How did you have a baby?	It came out of me.
My bed.	What else?
Which one?	I don't know which one 
Who?	Go away, I don't want you here.
She said Michael.	What did she mean?
It was dead.	It was alive wasn't it?
What did you do?	I put her to sleep.
Thanks. 	If I find anything I'll call you.
You hate us don't you?	What?
Like keeping her home from school?	Yes.
May I be present?	Of course.
But how did it happen?	You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
Oh, don't do this!	Wasn't it!
Lay them down.	Eh?
They're yours.	They are?
Can you fix him for me?	Yeah.
Sure.	And hurry, they're not looking too happy.
Sure. .	Ah well. Eh, look!
Oh, there you are!	Oh, I'm sorry, I must have made a mistake.
What are we waiting for?	Come here.
Sorry.	Eh, there's only three of them.
Are you supposed to be here?	I've got you worried, haven't I?
No, that's his other one.	That's all right then.
What are you doing there?	Hiding.
Aye, that's what I'm afraid of!	He's got you worried, then?
Give 'em a pull.	Shall I?
Now get on with it.	We were going to do it.
Hello.	Hello.
Well!	He'll get over it.
None for me, then?	Sorry.
What do you think are you're up to?	Someone put it on me.
Yeah, you want to watch it.	It's not my fault.
He's been gone a long time.	Who?
Good!  Maybe we'll be able to see something then.	Or something will be able to see us.
I got it.  Oh boy.	Where the hell are we?
I'll go first.	No, you'll follow me.
What is it?	Take a look.
Maybe we can get in by the top.	You want to try?
Can we come up?	No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.
How long to fix?	Hard to say.
He died.	What?
Okay.	That way.
Oh, no.  Oh, no.	What was that?  What the Christ was that?
It's really on there tight.	Here, let me try.
Hey, guess what?	What?
Where did it come from?	He's the only one that knows that.
It makes me sick to see him like that.	Isn't there some way we can get it off him?
Hey now, what is this?	Ask him.
There.  Should be coming through about there.	Careful, don't get under it!
Now we're in for it.	The door was closed.  It must still be in here.
We've got six hours left.	Oh my God.
It must have stopped moving.  I'm not getting anything.	Let me go first; you stay behind me.
This should do it.	I should hope so!  And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it.
That way.	You lead.
It's close, real close.	How far?
Air lock?	Who knows?
If we don't hear from him soon, I think we better go in after him.	Sun will be down in a minute.
What is it?	Don't touch him, watch it!
It's stopped?	Yes, thank heaven.
We do know that.	Yeah?
Oh my God.	Well, it's finally happened.
Martin, uh, we've found it.	Found what?
Find anything we missed?	I don't even know what I'm looking for.
Hey, can you guys hear me?	Yeah, we hear you!  We're coming back!
I understand why you did that.	Good.
We won't need it then.	All right, so that's what we've got. A week.  It's plenty of time.
Now what?	What do you think?  Now we go in.
Two down, four to go.	What's that supposed to mean?
Let's get back and call this in.	Wait a minute.
How many of them are there?	Too many.
Give or take.	We're not gonna make it, are we?
Are you alright?	What?  What's wrong?  What is it?
What the hell are you doing?	Hey, fair enough.  If you won't come, I'll handle it myself.
What?  Where?	Just behind us, over to the right.
Wait.  Lost it.	How?
Is this the suit?	Uh-huh.
Thanks.	Let's just run through it one more time so I know you've got it straight.
What is that?	Real man' drink.
Hurry it up.	Don't wait for me!
Hungry?	Just some coffee.
Just like that, eh?	Just like that.
I don't think that's funny.	It wasn't meant to be.
What time?	Almost four.
Bill!	Huh?
You've already met.	Where?
It's a good thought.	It won't play.
It's all over.	What's all over?
- little things here and there, it doesn't matter. You can be proud of yourself, you've got a right to be.	Are you proud of me, Bill?
Don't run away, Bill.	From what would I be running?
How do you do, my dear.	Oh, brother.
You all put together?	My back's open.  Did the extra help get here?
It's after one now. You won't get home till all hours.	I don't care if I never get home.
A part in a play. You'd do all that - just for a part in a play.	I'd do much more - for a part that good.
If you'd like.	I wouldn't like.
Do you want it on?	It doesn't matter.
What about Bill?	What about Bill?
I remember.	You'll be there, won't you.
Carl?	Yeah?
What's that?	The fucking New York Times.
What would you have done?	You asking would I have been one of the President's men?  I would have been.
I think that's him.	Who?
Hi, it's me. I'm still here.	I'm so glad.
Do you feel much about the things you did?	I didn't do anything wrong.
But they both worked at the White House?	I will not talk about the other two.
We're going to need lots of good luck, aren't we?	Nobody ever had too much.
Isn't that what you'd expect them to say?	Absolutely.
What the hell was that?	Sorry.
I'll do it.	Okay then.  The rest of you okay with that?
Great evening, isn't it?	Sure.
I had no idea you'd be this good!	Neither did I!
This.  Right now.	Uh-huh.
What do you suppose they're saying?	No idea.
Nice car.	I'm glad you think so.
Why are you doing this?	Because I want to.
What about the game?!	I'm not playing.
Give it to me!  Yes!	Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you.
You're so big!	Yeah, that's right.
Did I miss anything?!	Just in time.
Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no.	Come on, Jim.  Where are you?
Please, God.  Let this be it.	He's going in!
Holy shit.	Holy shit!
How do you know that?	She's already on a plane back home.
No, no that's fine.  So you doing okay?	Yeah.
Can I come in?	Yeah, sure.
Okay.	These are for you.  From father to son.
I know, Dad.	Oh, okay.  Here's let me show you.
Jim?	It's not what it looks like!
Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do?	Don't you want me to?
I'll just say that we had a great night together.	Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.
Yes.	I thought so.
You are very good in the world history class, yes?	Me?
Let me know.	Okay, don't stop.
And I want to try to make it up to you.	How?
That was a great night.	Yeah.
Hey.  I got another question for you.	What's that?
Yeah, but we'll still see each other.	Fuck yeah we will.
Really?	Uh huh.
I don't know if I want to be doing this.	Doing what?
Face it boyfriend. This is really happening.	No it isn't! You're dead!
You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.	Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
I'm serious. There's nothing for you down there. It's dangerous.	Come on. I'm from New York - the "shoot me" state. Don't wait up.
So you came after all. Just in time, it's getting interesting.	You must get out of here. It's not safe.
Don't you want to change?	Man! Our first date and already you're trying to get me to change! You French women work quick!
Hello?	Are you okay?
We don't both have to die.	I couldn't do it. Not to you.
I know where he'll go.	Where?
No wonder he let her go.	Really.
God. I can't believe it.	What?
Okay. Be careful.	You too.
Pull over! Now!	Shit!
What's the problem?	Hey, I'm new here, what do you want?
Do you think I'm an idiot?	Sure. Don't you?
I always wanted to do that. I saw it in a movie.	What about me?
Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell!	No we can't. That's the problem. God knows it would beat hanging around with you!
Shit. I feel sick.	Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
Well?	Okay. So maybe you were right.
Are you running away?	No.  I'm running to.
I have to go now, before it gets light.	But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
Is everyone all right?	I'm fine.
Did I tell you that?	You must have.
Come on up!	Why?
Come on!	No!
You said you wouldn't laugh!	It's not you - it's the dress!
Don't let me go!	I'll never let go!
Trust me, it's her!	How do you know?
It's her.	He's her?
Well, she certainly has a mind of her own.	Yes. And I hate that in a woman.
So where will you go?	She found her home. Maybe it's time I found one too!
Hey!	What?
Hi. Hi, hi.	Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.
Hey, listen, listen.	What?
Look at these guys.	Yeah.
I'm home!	Oh, yeah? How'd it go?
Remember, we had that thing.	What thing?
Christ!	Nothing at all?
Yeah, this place is great.	Yeah.
Oh, good. Okay.	I'm cool.
God.	Remember that day?
What'd I do?	Step up here!
Oh, I'm sorry!	Don't get upset!
Oh.	Tell him.
Oh.	Look, now, Charlie, give me a big laugh here.
Now, don't let it be so long, now.	No.
Oh.	It was a wonderful set.
You're not upset that I brought the dog?	Would it make a difference?
She already has.	It's alright, isn't it?
Why didn't you bring him?	What?
Would you leave us alone right now?	I love her too, Joe.
He's gonna miss his flight.	Yeah.
Take good care of it.	Count on it.
That for us?	What a nose.  You missed your calling.
What is it?	Let's go upstairs, okay?
You need to call your dad.	Leave us alone right now.
I call that a perfect day.	A perfect night.
Go.	Hey!  Would you?
You're out of your mind.	Just do what I say, alright?
No luck.	Oh, well, we'll just have to try again. Sound like a plan?
What did you get me?	In the morning, after everyone's gone and there's just us.
No.  Did you?	No.  I missed that.
I can't got tonight.  I don't want to be on a plane on my own tonight.	I'll be with you.
No.	Okay.
I know.	Will you make love with me?
Coffee?	Sure.
Are you okay?	I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny.
Ryan's really angry with me.	I think he's really angry with me too.
That's very nice.	I like you.
What?	Trust him.
I didn't say a word.	Time!
How's he doing?	Not good.
Ryan.	I'm sure you understand.
Ryan, you've got to come!  You've got to help me find the dog!  I let their dog out.  We need to find the dog.	You're not serious.
Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog!	Don't go in, Ryan.
We could hardly say no.	Oh?
Ryan!	Are you working on a new book?
Is there space here?	Yes.
Shit!	I'd cut off her red wine if I were you.
How's the movie going?  Your movie.  You are making a movie, aren't you?	Yes.  Fine.
Yes.	Well, so glad you decided to come.
Uh oh.  Goodbye!  Gotta run!	Wait!  When can I see you again?
What was that thing?	How should I know?
Wear this.	You're a real buddy.
This the place?	Yeah.  How much?
Good night.	Good night.
One more?	I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
You all right? What's the matter?	Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
When are you coming home?	As soon as I can walk.
I think I'm going to give it all up.	Give what up?
You sure you want to throw that card?	Sure.
Are you all right?	Sure.  What's that funny smell?
Are you all right?	I'm fine.
You like?  It's all yours.	Mine?
On account of me.	You?
Any of that coffee left?	Sure.
How's the patient?	Oh, I'm fine, Doc.
Where are you moving to?	I don't know. All I know is I got to get out of this place.
Can I ask you a personal question?	No.
Say, what's going on here, anyway?	Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
Still afraid somebody may see us together?	Let me take that.
Sorry it took me so long on the phone. But we're all set.	All set for what?
Did you have a nice Christmas?	Lovely. You were a big help.
How about a drink ?	Sure, thanks.
What do you see?	I don't know.
Charlie?	Looks that way.
He killed that guy without feeling anything.	Not a thing.
Smoke !	Where ?
Get in there !	This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party.
Listen.	What is it?
Hey, buddy, that boat still runs, eh?	Yeah, it still runs.
How did they know?	They must have seen the fire.
You smell that.  You smell that?	What?
Do you know me?	Yes.
You've gone crazy.	No. My thinking is clear.  But my soul has gone mad.
Gimme water.	No water.
You could never figure it because it doesn't make sense.	Fuck no.
Did you know him very well?	You get to know each other pretty well out there.
What's that?	Just something I read in the Free Press.
He'll kill us.	He can't kill us.  We're on his side.
You don't know how happy that makes me, sir.	Why?
Do you miss your home, Captain? Have you someone there?	No. Not really.
Are you warm, Captain?	The river is beautiful.
So that's it.	You may think what you wish, Captain, but I like you very much.
How long have you been up north?	Six months.
You should know something.	I don't want to talk any more.
Thanks.	I bet you haven't had lunch.
Let's go.	Wait a second.
Be careful, okay?	That's my line.
You're hurt.	Nothing broken.  C'mon, we have to hurry.
I'm not gonna carry you out of here.	That's right.  You're not.
Why in hell you care enough about me to die taking me in?	I don't plan on dying.
Sure love to know where you fit in up here.	I'm here to do my job.
Told you I'm fine!	How many do you see?
Maybe you can talk sense into your boyfriend.	Shut up!
What's wrong?	Just stay out of my face until I'm gone!
I'm too old for this shit.	Any idea who could've done it?
There's what they're waiting on!	They'll have to come right past us.
What is it you want? What?	I want us to go out.
Do you love me?	Uh-huh.
How long has he been having problems?	Since forever.
What about your mother?	How do you know about my mother?
I'm not kidding.	Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
So you'll be at work?	Yes.
Hello?	Are you still coming?
I was going to do that for you.	It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
You wanna dance?	I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
Sorry, didn't realize she was right there.  Did you have sex with her?	To hell with sex.
I don't want to hear that music right now.	What do you mean? You said you liked it.
Okay to say something now?	Go ahead.
Do you want to know what happened with my parents?	Yes. I really would.
Good night.	Good night.
One night with me!	You think you're kidding.
I'm sorry that I'm not taking you.	So am I, Frank.
Hey, where are you going? You can't do this.  I can't take a dog.  Nobody's ever been in here before.	You don't want to mess with me today. I'll figure something else out tomorrow.
Actually, I don't think so.	Wait here.
Shall I get her for you?	No, it's all right. I'll just watch.
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.	Thank you for walking him.
Would you leave now, please?	Stupid dog.  I don't get it.
You going to come talk to me or not?	I'm coming.
What's wrong?	I forgot to lock the door.
Is there a problem?	No.  No problem.  The airport, right?
Where you from?	What is this?
What are you doing?	What?
What are you doing?	Get out.  You think I'm running you up?  Get out.
So what happens now?	We go around once.
Okay.	What?  What's okay?
How'd you know?  Just tell me that. How'd you fucking know?	I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.
Five million dollars?	That's right.
You think I would be an idiot to pass up five million dollars.	You would be.
Michael?	No.  No.  No.  I don't believe it.
How did he know?	Know what?
I don't know what the fuck you are.	I know.  It was a joke.
I know what happened.	I bet you fucking know!
Bullshit.	Yeah.
Don't tell me I don't have a choice!	Right.
No.	Why?
I killed him.	Why?
It.  Tell it.  For all I know it could be a machine.	You said you didn't trust it.
Hey, where are you?	Thinking.
That's where he'll be.	What?
No.	Why not?
Do you think about the game?	Yes.
Do you think he's here?	Here?
Breakfast.	Why don't you bring it out here? It's beautiful out here.
You should knock.	Sorry.
What is it?  I don't like this at all.  What is going on here?	I don't know.  It just happened.  I was here ten years ago, I'm here now.  That's it.
What are you doing?	What?
Can I ask you something?	I'm sure you will.
Martin.	Martin.
Four minutes.	What?
Was nice.	Yes.
Would you like a drink?	I'd love one.  Whatever you're having.
You're very good at this aren't you?	I think you're supposed to answer that question.
Do you ever think about starting over?	All the time.
Is that all you want?	Yes.
Hey, do you mind if I talk a little?  I feel like, I don't know, talking I guess.	Sure.
I think I've heard of you.	It's possible.
Can I ask you something?	Go ahead.
You wish to close this account today?	That's correct.
He's not drunk, he's crazy.	Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.
Okay, it's in here somewhere. Let's keep it quiet.	We could make a run for it?
I don't know but that used to be a window and I think that was a door.	Can you do the lock on it?
It must be on the other side of this.	But how did the wall get here?
I'd love to get in there.	Don't we have enough already?
Perfect!	It looks new, they might miss one or two.
Afternoon!	Am I late?
Like a hand?	When your ready Son!
Red or white?	Both, see you later.
My God! What happened?	I fell in love.
It's me you want, I'm responsible for all this.	He's lying! I am.
What about me?	Here!
Yeah, no problem.	We ain't going to give it away this time, are we?
Well, he should be on his way back to his apartment by now.	Do you know the way?
I'm not staying out late and I can't come back to your place.	Whatever!
I don't want to get in trouble.	Don't worry it's okay!
It's not fair, you hardly talked to me tonight.	I'm sorry but it's been a crazy evening. I'm going to make that place into something big. God, I love you!
That's not true, we have a great time together. I've said I'm sorry. Let's forget about it and go stop by my place, so I can get changed.	Oh sure and you will want sex, always sex.
No, I love you, really.	Then tell me, what will happen? Tell me!
I thought for sure they would catch me.	Thanks.
Will it help to get you out?	I hope so!
I don't understand, it's your home?	There's nothing there for me.
There's three thousand and if you don't come through, I'm going throw you clean out of that window. Deal?	Deal!
I thought I'd help out.	We don't need you.
What would you like, beer?	No, just a coffee.
I'd better get you to a hospital.	I'll be okay, just get me home.
Don't you have a girlfriend?	Sometimes.
I'd better get going, do you need a hand to get into bed?	Sure!
Did you take your things over to my place?	Uh-huh!
This is your doing?	Yes, they had nothing to do with it.
Would you like your things now?	Yeah!
Sure!	Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
So, he didn't fire you?	No way, he even gave me back pay.
When the hell did you write that?	Just yesterday.
Yeah, so I hear. Don't you think you should go get changed?	Later.
I think we should be going honey.	What for?
That's my bag.	Go to hell!
Will you come home and forget all about him?	Yes, if you can get him free.
So go dance.	With you.
She asleep?	I'll tell her you were here.
To see your father?	No. I won't be long.
A late night or an early morning?	Late night.  You?
I'm sorry. I didn't know.	I didn't know either.
What are you doing here?	He wants to talk to you.
Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her.	No. Hey. We're sorry, man!
I know you don't want help.	Then we both know.  I'll point. You drive. Faster.
Yeah.	Why?
I'll take a chance.	Go for it.
So what else is on this list?	It's private.
You're really into God, right?	In ten words or less?
He doesn't trust you.	Sometimes I don't even trust me.
The play's going to be really good.	I'm really glad you think so.
The play's in a couple of weeks.	Yes. And?
You were great the other night.	Thank you. So were you.
I haven't been nice to you.	You're hardly nice to anyone.
All of it.	It's not.
So you're talking to me?	When I have something to say.
What does that mean?!	It means you can do anything.
Hey.	I heard what you did. Thank you.
Like fire.	What?
Yes. But not as a date date.	Why not?
Your turn.	No.
Excuse me?	Fun.
Stand right here.	Where?
It's places like this that make me certain there's a God.	You're sometimes not sure?
I might do it wrong.	Not possible.
Come on.	Where?
What'd you tell your father?	The truth. I just left you out of it.
What's the best thing I can see tonight?	Me.
Help me live until I die?	I will.
Nope.	Anything you want.
What are you thinking?	That I want you to take me home.
I've talked to your father.	That's what I mean.
How you doing?	Tired.
How're you doing?	Better. I was really angry.
It's gone now.	Because you have hope that you'll get better?
I'm sorry your mother isn't here to help you become a woman.	Dad, I've become a woman without her. Just not a pretty one.
Did you give him a gift?	No.
You're in the play?	Lead man.
I care for her.	I don't want to see her hurt.
This week.	Ever again.
You've been well?	Yes. You?
Shall I give you a few ideas?	Please.
Morning Dick.	Marty. What's for breakfast?
How was school today?	Fine.
Huh?	Have we ever met before?
George! He's supposed to ask you to the dance!	But he didn't ask me.
I think I know exactly what you mean.	You do?
Is that what you were going to ask me, George? To go to the dance?	No!
Okay, Martin. You have a good evening now.	Yeah,  Right.
I know.	You did what?!?
Pretty, isn't it?	It's the most beautiful city I've ever seen! What is it?
Sweet and what?  Maybe you'd better pay for this first.	Sure,.
Look, maybe I'd better talk to Dick. Is he around?	Dick? Dick who?
Can you imagine your parents in bed together?	No way!
You promise to stay down there for an hour?	Yeah.
Catch!	What do you mean?
That's what he told you, huh?	No, he showed me one.
Sure is pretty.	What'd you come out here for?
You know, before I met her, nobody could ask me how I was doing with my girl. Matter of fact, I didn't really have one.	Is that right?
Hi.	What're you doing?
That's my father. I got to run.	Hey, wait a minute. When am I going to see you again?
Well, I know what my daddy's going to say.	What?
Hi.	Well, stop the world.
Can I come around and see you tomorrow?	Okay.
What a nice place.	Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
Somebody else is going to get it.	I don't care.
You know what I think?	What?
I came in the front.	How bad off is he?
Are you sure?	You don't believe me, see for yourself.
How you doing?	I'm fine. Kind of tired.
Is he upset?	He didn't say anything to me about it.
Think I got 'em?	I don't know.
What'd you put him in there for?	Just to keep him out of the sun.
You tired?	Yeah.
Hey, why're you always walking ahead of me?	Well, why you always walking behind me?
Don't.	Anybody ever done that to you before?
Have you got a better idea?	I just don't want to go.
Course it's too bad about your dad.	Yeah.
What's that?	Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
Hi.	Yes?
You're my friend, aren't you?	Yes.
You didn't walk out here.	It's mine all right.
Okay, friend. Start running.	Just gimme a chance.
Hi.	Hold it right there.
Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?	I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
Where're you goin'?	To get my guns.
Was she pretty?	Who?
You keep an eye on it.	Any time.
Yes, I'm afraid I have.	What are they like? What are they about?
I write.	Oh yeah? What kind of write?
Well that's what he said.	What else?
I hope these are your shoes.	Hi, Charlie.
Jesus, what a day I've had. Ever had one of those days?	Seems like nothing but, lately.
Big fuckin' deal.	You want my partner to kiss your ass?
He teach you to do it?	You two have some sick sex thing?
Where were you tonight?	Home. Watching TV.
Yeah, I was drinking.	When did you start drinking again?
Take care, you hear?	Did you find out about her parents?
You okay?	Yeah.
What was she like?	Who?
You did it for me.	Yes.  I care about you.  I did it for you.
What is your problem?  I'm trying to help you.  Why won't you let me help you?	I don't need any help.
What are you doing here?	Put your hands up!
How long were you having sex with him?	About a year and a half.
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.	I have nothing to hide.
How did you feel when he died?	I loved him.  I hurt.
Even though you were fucking him.	You still get the pleasure.  Didn't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, Nick?
Sure.	Thanks.
How do you know all this stuff about me?	You know all about me.
Would you like a drink?  I was just going to have one.	No, thanks.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.	I'd like to ask you some, too.
You tell me.	I don't know.  But you do.
Aren't you going to thank me?	What's it about?
Why does he do it?	To see if he can get away with it.
When did you write it?	You mean did I write it before my parents died?
Maybe she saw something she didn't see before.	She's seen everything before.
What did you think?	I thought it was a pretty good beginning.
You shouldn't play this game.	I don't have a choice.
You're in over your head.	I know.
It's OK.  It's OK.	Make love to me.
No.	No?
You won't believe me.	Try me.
Do you believe me?	I don't know.
Can I talk to you a minute?	Honey, why don't you go in the car?  I'll be right there.
You still think I kill people, don't you?	No.
How'd you get in here?	I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
I finished my book.	How did it end?
In the beginning.  Then I got to like what he did for me.	That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?
Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine?	What are you doing here, Pop?
What's goin' down, son?	Nothin'  I'll be okay, pop.
I don't think it's funny.	Well, hell, son, it's got a certain ring to it, I'll say that.
You feeling better?	I feel fine!
I'm not afraid of her.	Why the hell not?
You know that stuff they say about how you can judge people by their friends?	I don't believe it.
Where the hell you goin'?	I'm going with you.
You sure?	I'm sure.
Tell me again.  I want to hear you say it again.	It was an accident.
Is this finished yet?	I don't know.
I wish they'd quit writing this shit about me.	That's good. At least they're interested.
That was my favorite part!	We can do better. It needed more white.
These are great.	Aren't they?
No.	You haven't been by lately.
When?	How about right now?
Who did this?  Who did this?	I don't know. I told you, this isn't my apartment.
What is it that gets you out of bed in the morning? 	I hate this. Turn that off.
It's Andy again.	Still not here.
Blue? Where?	What's wrong with you today?
We got beat.	For real?
I don't really have any problems.	Good. What do you have?
She's good.	I guess it was a long time ago.
Sit down! You're gonna fall out!	Me fall? Let's get some drugs!
No, don't tell me you just got fired by your crazy boss.	I guess you did.
Do you know what he's saying?	What who's saying?
You look fucking beautiful, beautiful.	Well thanks!
It looks done.	Think so?
Hi.	Hi.
Hi.	Hi.
See you later.	Thanks
You don't have any!!!	That's impossible. I've got, like, five of 'em!
I suppose you feel better now, sir.	No, actually I feel worse.
I guess this mean we won.	Yes, I suppose that we did.
We've met.	Have we?
Son!	Dad!  Save yourself!
I'm sorry.  I was too late.	Too late for what, dear child?
But I can't can I?	No, my boy.  I'm afraid none of us can.
I love you, old man.	Remember this.  And remember it always.  I'm proud of you.  And I love you too, son.
It's good to see you.	What seems to be the problem?
I could have made it, you know.  I didn't need your help.	Whatever you say, lady.  It's all in a day's work for me.
Go on, kill me too.  Just as you killed my wife.	I didn't kill your wife.
Pull back.  You can't make the jump.	I can make it.
And?	Can I get some help over here?
Make yourself right at home.	Where is my wife?
Bad luck, I'm afraid.  It's time to die, little bird.	What do you mean?
The dreams again, sir?	I think they're getting worse.
How are you feeling, young man?	Not that young. It's been a long time since you've called me that.
Like normal folks.	What? This isn't normal?
Find anything interesting?	Why do I feel like the other man, here?
Why do you do that?	What?
Okay. I'm outta here.	Excuse me.
I need to be part of this.	Absolutely not.
I'll show you it works.	What the hell is going on here?
How high up would you say that is?	I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
Like your boyfriend. He's kinda hot.	Take me. Let the boy go.
GET IN THE CAR!!	WHICH CAR?
Look! Police!	I know. I called them.
Please.	I won't let you have it.
Got it!	What now?
We got 'em!	Take 'em! I want his head!
SOMEBODY'S KILLED THE POWER!!	WHAT?
Oh.  Sorry.  I was thinking.	What were you thinking?
HOLY SHIT!!	You okay?
Here, let me do that.	No, I'm fine.
He doesn't like to say much does he?	Right first time.
Say that again, son.	I beg your pardon?
Well, congratulations.  Isn't that great, David?	Certainly is.
Of course.	And a car.
Interesting suit.	Why thank you sir.
Huh huh huh. That was cool.	No it wasn't!
Wait, I wanted her to do it.	Huh huh. Soon, she will be mine.
Huh huh huh. I'm ready for love.	Me first! Me first!
Me first.	Huh huh. No way, dude.
So, like, where is she?	Yeah, really.
You got two seconds!	Uh, huh huh. Is that gonna be enough time?
Who sent ya?	Uh, huh huh, this fat dude. He said we could do you. And he was gonna pay us.
Oh no.	It's your turn, darling.
Oh, honey, we may need that.	No, I'm not putting up with this.
That little girl saw us.	She couldn't have.  We can't make them see us.
I guess we open it.	Maybe we should knock first?
What is going on?	Really.  I don't know.
No, you don't!  He does not work well with others.	What do you mean?  What's he do?
Tell the truth.	I always tell the truth.  Of course I can see you.
I hate you!  I can't trust anybody!	No, wait!
Is the rest of the house as bad as this?	The rest of the house is probably worse.  When can you and I get started?
What's wrong?	I thought I saw something.
You don't have a key?	Maybe Charles does.
What's happening to them?	I don't know.
They don't want to come down.	Why not?
Their wedding clothes.	Their wedding clothes.
I would like to walk today.	Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
Would you care for a drink?	Yes. Thank you.
May I ask your name?	My name is Chance.
Can you see well?	Yes, very well, thank you.
What about money?	I never needed money.
I don't think we should call anyone just yet, it may not even be all that serious.	I agree.
Come on, Eve. Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you.	Would you two excuse me for a moment?
You're right, Mr. President I don't like feeling sorry for myself.	Take care of yourself, Ben.
When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly?	Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thousand times, thank you!	Tell your friends.
Yeah, just an idea I had.	She's very beautiful.
Hi.	Hi.
I have to go back.	Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
How was it?	I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.
You were him last night, weren't you?	Yes.
Tell her you need to see her.	You bastard.
My God!	I'm so glad you're safe. You look really wonderful.
Holy shit, yes!	Holy shit, yes!
What?	I just wanted to say i. Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work?
Don't you want to know what happened to me?	No.
This is important!	It better be.
Do you dream often?	Do you?
It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I think I'm going crazy.	I'm sure you're not going crazy.
We have to meet.	One hour.
Can I get you a drink?	Whatever you're having.
Thanks so much for coming over.	Oh, I'm really glad you called.
Darling!	What the fuck is going on?
Shut up!  Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute.	It's okay, my sweet.
Folks came.	Folks come. Folks go.
Well?	Well what?
The Word. What you was put here to speak.	That's the last thing they took from me.
YOU HURT ME.	I WILL PROTECT YOU.
DID YOU COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE.	YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
WILL YOU STAY?	WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME WHO AM YOU?
You don't sit with me!!	Baby, don't be like that.
I want somethin' sweet.	We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
Your mother all right?	No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day.
Yes?	May I come in?
Should I wake her?	No, let her rest.
DON'T LOVE HER TOO MUCH.	DO YOU FORGIVE ME?
OUT THERE. WAY OFF.	DADDY IS COMING FOR US.
Morning.	Morning, ma'am.
But you didn't come here talking 'bout Paul. You came asking about a new girl.	That's so.
This is hard for me. But I got to do it. Two things I got to say to you. I'm a take the easy one first.	If it's hard for you, might kill me dead. 
I said I had two things to say to you. I only told you one. I have to tell you the other.	I don't want to know.
Jesus.	It ain't what you think.
What, baby?	She left me. She's gone again.
Not too sweet! You make it too sweet they don't eat it.	Make it the way I always do.
Hey!!	Yes sir.
Fuck.	What do you think?
Jesus fucking Christ.	Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago.
Excuse me?	Nothing.
Yeah Walter, what's your point?	Huh?
Take it easy, Dude.	Yeah.  Thanks man.
Tell me a little about yourself, Jeffrey.	Well, uh. . . Not much to tell.
Way to go, Dude.  If you will it, it is no dream.	You're fucking twenty minutes late. What the fuck is that?
Oh shit.  Walter.	What the fuck is going on there?
That's it.  I'm out of here.	For Christ's sake, Dude.
Who the fuck is that?	Huh?
Oh, shit.	He can't walk, Walter!
Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you.	Hey, cool it Walter.
What's mine is mine.	Come on, Walter!.
Dude here.	Who is this?
Shut the fuck up.  Hello?	Yeah?
Well?  Aren't you?	Well. . . yeah.
Put me down, you son of a bitch!	Walter!
Where to first?	The House of Pain.
What was that?	Nothing.
Each day is a little life.	What?
Anyone else make it?	I don't think so.
Thank you.	For what?
You don't want to go there.	Why?
How does it look?	Not good.
You came back for me.	Did you think I wouldn't?
What do you think?	Sounds like a plan.
Your security's for shit, kid.	Where the hell have you been?
What's going on?	He was here.  Watching us.
What took you so long?	Don't even start, old man.
Beautiful day, isn't it?	How can you be out here?
You're not going anywhere.	Watch me.
How did you know?	Figured they'd send someone after you. Thought I'd wait around and see who showed up.
You can't do this, he's human, it's murder.	It's war, now get the fuck out of the way!
What are you looking at?	What do you see here?
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.	You make it sound like I'm already dead.
It won't work on you.	What are you talking about?
How could you be a part of this?	These are my people now. I'm one of them.
This isn't human blood.	Then what is it?
Five minutes, not a second more. And I don't want to hear a word about "us".	No problem.
We keep in radio contact.	You've been listening in the whole time?
Why didn't you tell me the truth about him?	We weren't sure we could trust you.
What, are you alright?	My eye, is there something in my eye?
Jesus.	What?
No.	You sure?
What?	You said the name "James."
What can I get you?	Sleep.
I want to see something!	Whatever you want.
I know you're in there, you piece of shit!	You have to go.
Does it hurt?	Like hell. Play the goddamn tape.
I don't believe this.	I do.
What movies?	Ask me what I don't have.
What I never could figure about the movie?	What?
What're you, crazy??	What're you, nuts?
Get out of here!	What're you doing with all this shit?
Get inside quick, they'll stop.	Too busy eating us?
Where?	Down there in the Park.
Who?	No one ever comes here.
Hold this.	What?
What're you doing?	This isn't about us.
What?	Look over there.
Well, she's got to be somewhere here.	No one's been in or out since you left. Would've heard the dogs.
Just hold on!	I can't!
What is it you thought you saw on that tape?	Still working on it.

I don't want to cause any trouble.	I'm here, aren't I?
Are you alright?	Yeah. let's get outta here. What happened?
You really want to do this, don't you?	I don't want you to get involved, really, I mean, I do, but if something went wrong I mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
Here's to. an interesting experience.	I'll drink to that.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.	Why not?
Well, how did it go?. What happened?	Well. I've found out some things. nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
Can I give you a kiss good night?	You better not, Jeffrey.
You were late.	I'm really sorry.
Great. Hey. I've got a bit of a problem. I know some things. that could help your father but you might get into trouble.	Jeffrey. are they important things? Well forget me - you have to tell him. Jeffrey. I mean it.
Okay.	What is it?

You want to dance?	I can't dance fast.
You want to dance?	Okay.
Oh my God. What's wrong?	Frank!!

Good to see you, son.	It's good to see you, Dad.
Where's all your things, Jeffrey?	This is it.
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.	Be right down.
Can I use the car tonight?	Of course, Jeffrey.
God. you scared me.	Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.	Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
He comes over to study.	Yeah.
Here you are. Would anyone like coffee?	That sounds great!
Come on out a minute, okay?	Okay.
Are you sure this guy is cool?	You'll see for yourself.
This is it for me.	What is?
Are you sure this guy is cool?	You'll see for yourself.
This is it for me.	What is?
Should we buy it?	Are you kidding?
You wanna split?	Yeah, I don't feel so well.
Surprise.	Baby, you didn't have to come.
What did I tell you?	It's great and everything, but what am I going to do with all this?
It's nothing personal, George.  Just business.	Yeah.  I understand.  Just business. Right.  Fuck you.
If you don't mind me asking, what is the reason you are in this place?	What?
Oh, come on, George.  If we are to be friends, we must trust each other.	Murder.
George, good to see you, my brother.	What the fuck is going on?  When did you get out of jail?
I'm calling it three.	We're half a million off.
Tell him I don't want to see him.  Tell him he's not welcome here.	Mom.
You mad at me?	Not mad.
You're like your mother.  You love money.	Dad.
How are you doing, George?	What do you guys want?
Figured it out.	Figured what out?
Figured it out.	Figured what out?
Hello.	Hello.
You better know what you're doing, George.  You're playing with fire.	I like fire.
Not in front of the kid.	Don't give me that shit.  You just better do something.
You should have taken better care of me, you know?  You've been away a long time. Four years.  Say something.	What do you want me to say?  I'm in prison.  You should know.  You put me here.
Hey, look.  You start paying, who knows what will happen.  You're a good father, George.  I always gave you that.  But you've got to talk to her.	Yeah.
Hey, George.  You okay?	Yeah.  I'm fine.  I'm good.
Everything's gonna be okay, sweetheart. Don't be upset.	What's happening to us?
I don't know.	Are we gonna split up?
What are you doing here?	Nothing.  I just wanted you to know I was out.  I just wanted to see you.
Let me ask you something.  If you could go anywhere in the world, anywhere, where would you want to go?	You mean, like a trip?
Bye, Dad.  See you in the morning, okay?	I'll be here.
I'm thinking about getting out of town this week.  You want to come with me?	Where are you going?
I'm sorry, baby.  I'm so sorry.	It's alright, Dad.
It's not enough.	What?
But I haven't shot him.	You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.
And how many are we?	Not enough.
Read it.	Here?
I think I'm going to make your day.	How?
Yeah.	Then you can go.
About three hours.	Cause?
What are you saying, Henry?  That his girlfriend fucked him to death?	Yes.
No questions.	You may call your next witness.
Why did she say she was leaving?	She didn't.  She just left.
You'll be sorry?	I was angry.
I don't know.  I'm not sure.	Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible?
I'm gonna go to jail.  I know they're gonna make it look like I did it. They gotta put it on someone.	Why'd you come here?
Do you think I did it?	I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.
Frank!	I'll have you out in a few hours.
Can we get out of here?	Sure.  Where to?
This is your house.	I know.
Hello?	Hi.  It's Frank.
Sorry.	It's okay.
Alone?	Of course.
Can I see you later?	You can see me now.
Sugar or honey?	Honey.
What are you going you doing?	Are you scared?
I love you.	I love you too, Dad.
I know.	Talk to me.
Yes.	What time did you leave?
Yeah.	Michael.
Bar across the street.	Have you called Betty?  Maybe you should.
She's changed.	Oh, yes.
Oh there you are.	Oh! You caught me.
Mind if I smoke?	Not at all.
Feeling better?	Much.
Yeah?	I want you to come.
Sorry I'm late. Richard called.	Oh, how is he?
You want to eat something?	Are you hungry?
Take me somewhere.	What?
Oh, I'm sorry.	It's okay. It's not that hot anymore. Thanks God.
But you don't mind.	No, I don't mind.
I can't do this, honey.	What?
Where was she?	Across the street. She went into the park and got turned around and didn't know her way out.
Sleep all right?	Yes, thanks.
What time is it?	Later. Go back to sleep.
Okay.	What's her name?
About an hour ago.	They're not going to find her!
Don't feed that dog.	You people really don't like dogs.
Is it true?	Yeah.  He lived there.  And died there, too.
Hey, kid.	Yeah?
That's what?	That's some terrible shit.
I ain't interested.  And if you gonna sell it, don't sell it round here.	Just try it.
I want you to do something for me, baby.	What?
What it will be.	How did you get in here?
Aren't you going to join us?	I have to finish this for class.
He'll kill them.  He'll kill every last one of them.	Who?
Told you so.  Alright.  We tried.  Let's go home.	Mother!  No.
Careful.  That's bad luck.	That place is already bad luck.
I'm here.	Bill!  Bill?!
We gotta jump!	I can't!
You got the cash?	You got the shit?
Let me see it.	Let me see it.
But maybe we're the ones who should be down there.  Doing something.  Making it better.	Can't be done.  That place already died and gone to hell.
Not really to live, just to play.	That building?
Boy, put that thing down.  You can't take that.  Might be evidence.	Evidence of what?
Shit!  Damn dog.  We gonna have to do something about you.	What we have to do is call the police.
You shouldn't have hit me.	You want to get into this now?
That's right, I know.  I fucking know.	Know what?
How the fuck can I open it?	The same way you did before.
You don't think I'll do it, do you?	I think you're fucking crazy!
We know how this was done, eh?	Yeah, I know.
Just look at this mess I got to deal with.	What are you going to do with it?
Don't worry, I'll get some more.	There's no time.
They were early.	What are you talking about?
You mean they weren't up here?	No!  They're still on their way.
I hate that little fuck!  I hate him!  I hate him!  I should've done him!	But you know he did it.
I got it!  I know what I got to do! I got to get the money.	The money?  The money's gone.
He didn't see you, did he?	No.
You can't leave.	The hell I can't!
What are you doing?	We're going to need some time.
What did she do to you?	Everything you couldn't.
I'm going to make myself a drink, if that's okay?	Go right ahead, sir.
How many'd you do?	Five.
You can't kill me yet.	Why?
Is that the money?	Yeah, that's it.
Hello?	This is the police, ma'am.
No joke, ma'am.  Please open the door.	How do I know you are cops?
Ma'am, you have to open the door.	All right.
See?  We're for real.	I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
Truck.	Truck.  Of course.
Okay, one drink.	What do you want?
Curious, maybe.	Curious?  That's funny, I'm feeling a bit curious myself right now.
Are you surprised that I know what it is?	Maybe.
I had to see you.	Look, I don't think this is a good idea.
You didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to.	I guess I wanted to.
What's wrong?	Nothing.
Yes there is.  I felt it this morning when I brought you the coffee.	Shit, here we go.
Fuck it!  I think you better leave.	I think so, too.
All right, let's say for the moment that I believe everything you are saying.	You think I'm lying?
The difference is, I can have sex with someone I just met, someone I hardly know, but to steal I need to know someone like I know myself.	Do you think you know me like that?
And where is it now?	In his office.  I saw it this morning.
Yes.	Good.
What time did you say they would be there?	The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
We want him to come down, to relax, feel in control again.	Poor boy, has to work so hard.
Where will you be?	Waiting in the apartment next door.
He'll have to run.	If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
Jesus, that's beautiful.	Thank you.
I had a partner and she fucked me.	I won't.
It's me.	What happened?
Oh, thank God.	I'm still here.
Hey.	Hey.
Was this a game or a fuck up?	I don't know.
Kane.  Do you have Mr. John Michael Kane?	One moment, sir.
So what's in Paris?	I want to go home.
Look, I want a ride to Paris.  That's all I want.  I swear.	You swear?  That's great.  I feel so much better now.
Just so you know, if you're gonna burn me on the money, you might as well kill me.  I was supposed to have this car back three days ago.  It's not my car.	I know that.
I don't know.  I don't know who I am.	Yeah, well, welcome to the club.
I needed a break.	Where are we?
You ever think maybe you have a family?	I thought about it.  I don't know.
Where?	Yeah.  Pull in here.  Park it.
So this is it, right?	I guess.
I should go.	I don't remember any of this.
Look, I don't know what's up there.	You got me pretty fucking curious.
This is like a real apartment.  This is really yours?	I guess so.
Stop where you are.	What?
Who is it?	We have to keep moving.
What was I thinking, right?	I can't protect you anymore.
Can I help you?	This your store?
Where's the dog?	My husband's out looking for him.
What the hell're you talking about?	You're in danger.  All of you.  I have no time to explain.
What the fuck is he doing?	Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
What if it doesn't come back?	I told you.  You need to rest.
What have you got there?	Got there!
Sam!	Jack!
What's the matter?	Sorry. Nothing.  See you - I'm going to be late.
Jack!!	SAM! What a surprise!
Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.	Do you know what you're doing.
You stupid bastard!	What?
What are you doing? For Christ's sake! Get moving!	Who are you?
It's heavy.	A heavy Christmas present.
Why don't you say, no system is perfect.	Well, no system is.
Look at that - right on time.	What? I thought you were free to come and go as you please.
I was right! Step on it!	Let go! We've got to stop!
Come on, let's go! Let's get out of here!	Oh God! What have we done?
I'm going to open it!	No you're not!
They're gone.	Are you sure?
Make yourself at home. Don't answer the phone or open he door to anyone. I won't be long.	Where are you going?
That's it.	You are good to me Sam.
My mother said it would be all right.	She didn't say anything about it to me.
Put the phone down and your hands up.	What? Who is this?
Are we?	Ah yes, the lady is waiting.
Now look what you've done to him.	Have you got one or haven't you?
Sign here please.	What is it?
Nice and easy now. Keep your hands where I can see them.	What is this?  Who the hell are you?
Are you expecting anyone?	No. Wait here.
You know each other a long time?	Two years. Ever since we left island.
She wanted something to help her sleep.	Mary, we really have to go.
I guess I'll be going.	Just take it easy.
Does that hurt?	No!
So, Frank, am I going to live?	You're going to live.
Twelve Young, answer the radio. I have a call for you.	She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
Okay, what happened?	He's going to be all right, right?
You're not going to die.	What did you say?
Here, you try.	No, I'd better not.
Do you have any music?	What?
Is there any chance?	I guess there's always a chance.
That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn't he?	Yes.
It's been bad lately, but it's always bad.	How long you been doing this?
I shouldn't have asked you to come.	You asked me not to come.
Mary. Mary, we've got to get going.	No, no.
What is it? You want to help me, you feel sorry for me? Keep it to yourself.	I need to sit down a minute.
This is not a good time.	There's no time.
Who is it?	Frank.
It's coming.  Hold her down.	What's that, Frank?
Don't give me that look.	What look?
Where you going?	I quit! I'm through!
Would you like to come in?	Yes.
These are hard times, Tom.	Yeah. Great, isn't it?
Mr. Oh.	It's early for him.
Turn it off.	What?
Well why didn't you say so?	He's drunk.
Faster! God!	Faster!
He's crazy.	You really think so?
Yes.	There are only ten.
Wait.	What?
No.  No.	No?
Where's where I asked him about being scared?  You should work on your speech.	No.  It makes me nervous to think about it.  Let's do this.
Okay.  Let's do me.	Sure.
I write for you sometimes.	Not because you have to.
How'd it go?	You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
Don't go.	This is important to me.
What?	Let me think a second.  It's tough.
I think you're the Devil.	No.  You know that I'm not.
Don't say anything about anything.	Hi.  Will I ever sing again?
Ready.	Your hair's a little funny.
Okay.  I think I'd better be alone for a while.	I understand.  I'll go with you.
Just a few questions?	No.
We came from Washington.	Move away from me.
Okay.  I just wanted you to know.	What is she shooting?
Just when do you start, telling people?	Almost immediately.
You don't have time.  Not a chance.	I'll be right down.  It's right tight.
What did he say?	I'll never tell.
They're not really going to call security are they?	No, I don't think so.
Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore.	Okay.
What?	They fired me.
I never told you the reason I was telling you everything for.	Hey?
Hi.	How's it going?
You okay?	Yes.  Just don't say anything mean for a while.  Thanks.
Nervous?	Excited.
It's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you.	Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
So you like me, huh?	I like you as much as I can like anyone who thinks I'm an asshole.
You okay?	Great.
Hi.  It's me.	Where are you?
Hello?	Yes.
Take it easy.	Why did I have to do this to myself?  Watch you take off.  Call me if you need anything.
What a great surprise.  I didn't think we had a chance.  I heard you wanted to stay in Washington.	Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot.
I sure know that feeling.  Terrific work today.	Right back to you.
That's enough.  That's enough.	I'm sorry.
Don't you work here?	Not anymore!
Would you like to do me?	I just might.
Tonight.	What, right now?
Not even a little bit?	I already told you I'm not.
Walter can I ask you something?	What!
Alright we're clear.	Anything new?
What the hell's going on?	Everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
How did you ever find it all in yourself, Walter?	It wasn't easy.
Did you hear what he said?	Yes Walter.
I mean, you look so pretty.	Thank you.
Goodbye.	Bye!
Now calm down Walter!  Now, let's go in there, and when the show's over, maybe we can talk about it.	No! I want to talk about it now!
I'm sorry about what I said before.	Forget it.
Put it in the middle of the room!	When did you make this, Walter?
Are you trying to be funny?	I'm totally serious!
Look at that, man.  Big deal.	I know.
What did he say?	Didn't you hear him?
Where'd ya buy that?	I didn't buy it I made it.
Dead Cat!	Dead Cat?
People seem to like my cat.	Enough already about it - get to work!
What do you have in the box?	Just wait till you see this!
How ya doin'?	Uh, hi.
You're gonna shoot me!	Turn around!
YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME!	Walter shut up and relax!
Hi.	Good morning Walter!
I won't say good luck, Walter.	Why not?
I get it Walter.  I get it.	What do you get?
What's wrong with you!?!	My arm!  He took my fucking arm!
Nice to feel needed.	Let's move out!
No, we didn't.	Oh, yeah.  But I still want to know what happens.
It's coffee.	Amazing!
You're the guys from the movie!	We hate you guys!
Excellent.	What's playing there?
Oh, my God.  Is that true?	Probably.  What movie is this?
What'd you dream about?	Nothing.
Hey there.	Hi.
Hey, baby, how ya doing?  You look beat.	I do?  I guess I do.
I am a God!  A God!	I am so sure.
Will you guys shut up, please?	It could happen.
Hi.	Hi there.
I'm kinda beat.  You can stay in my mom's room if you want.	I think I'll just hang out here. Make sure the sun comes up and everything.
I didn't expect to see you.	I know.
I'm going to the dance.	What for?
Are you okay?	Get away from me!
What are we doing?	Why don't we see a movie?
Let's meet tonight, okay?	Where?
You were supposed to be here at three.	I forgot.
Excuse me for having something important to do.	This isn't important?  The earth is our home.
Just stay away from me, okay?	Did you ever dream that you were someone else?
How do you know all this?	I have to show you.
Who we gonna beat?	Who we gonna beat?
What!?!	Try to pay attention.
He was slow.  Very simple.  They won't all be that easy.	Fine.
Five?	Five.
None of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.	And where are they now?
Wait!	He knows who I am!
Come one, that was so weird.	What, it's not weird.  I just cut the stupid hot dog in half.
That is so cool.	Thank you very much.
Hi, guys.	Hi.
I haven't seen him tonight.	Oh.
I can't!	You know you must.  There is only one.  Now you are that one.  It is time.
Write that down.	Okay, what else?
Oh, yes!  Yes!	Oh, baby!
Cool!	Does Jeffrey know?
Oh, yeah!	Right!
Ah, you'll be coming back.	I don't think so.
Yeah maybe you're right.	You see how nice things are when we go slow?
How was that?	A little better.
That's my leg.	I know what it is.
No!  You're playing with my mind!	I'm trying to play with your body!
I gotta leave first thing in the morning.	That's great!
Neither will I.	I think I'm ready for the Show.
Damn.	Let me.
Can I ask you something?	What?
I'm going to the Show.	Then go.
I'm trying to thank you.	Let go of me!
C'mon, we got nothin' to fight about.	You fuck!
Sorry about last night.	Forget it.
We want you to room with him on the road and stay on his case all year.  He can go all the way.	And where can I go?
Well tell 'em, honey.	We're getting married.
Look at yours.	What?
Yeah, I don't want her in there more than a few more minutes.	No, it's - it'll just be a couple of minutes. We got other things to do too, you know. He'll hurry her up. How's everything else besides this?
Stop -	Wait, hold on a second.
She's my wife.  Look at me. You did know that, didn't you? You knew that she's my wife? Huh? Hey, look at me.	Yeah, yeah. I know that.
Okay.	You fuckin' piece of shit.
Hello.	Hello.
You understand? Put her on the fuckin' phone.	Sam, I - I don't know where she is, okay?
Sam, let me ask you a question. You must really trust your wife.	Yeah, sure I do. Why?
Oh. Have a good day at school.	Okay.
Dad!	What happened? What happened? Who did this to you?
When did this happen, honey?	I don't know.
You don't know? What time did your mother do this? When did she leave?	I don't know.
Holy shit, what've you been doin' out here?	Honey, come here.
No, I didn't know that. But you know what he did?	No.
Yeah.	Meet me at three.
Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? Goin' over my head?	What people?
Yeah, what are you doin'? You okay?	No, I'm not okay.
Hey, it is my pleasure.	Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
You go and put your things away.	And they were usually right.
We need this guy.	We can't get rid of him?
Sam, we got a problem.	What is it?
Okay. Just take it easy.	Right away. Okay?
You all right?	Yeah.
Want to go? Let's go back in.	Okay.
Okay, want to go with Mommy?	What do you need?
Hello.	Hi, it's me.  Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
So, what'd ya do with it?	With what?
Get off of me! Stop it!	Come with me now! Come with me now. Come with me now. I want you out of here.
I want you out of here! I want you out of here!	Let go of me! Let go of me!
Take your  fuckin' bag and get out of here!	I'll go, but I want my money right now!
I am not! She's my daughter too! Goddamn you!	Get out of here!
Now, you're gonna have to learn with your left hand.	God! 
Excuse me.	What?
I just wanna get out of here.	And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand?
Fuckin' kids at home!  Here.  Get the fuck out of here.	Thanks, Nick.
You know where she gets this from!	You shut up.
Go back inside! This is none of your business!  I don't have to take your shit all the time anymore.	Hey.
No, you can, you can.  You've been so nice to me.	I can't.
Hey!	Hey!
Come on. I'm sorry.	Okay.
There's nothing we can do. She had the key.	She's on the account. There's nothing we can do.
Fuck you! Fuck you!	Yeah?
Leave me alone!	Here we go!
He's comin' over.	Great!
Yeah, I'm over here with him.	Oh.
You got a round figure on it?	Definitely the most important guy in this room.
Tell me.	I know it wasn't a nice thing to do but -
Thanks.	Yeah.
Thank you.	It's all right.
You did. I like that. I like that. That's what I like about you. You did the right thing.	I did what you told me to.
No, he's not.	He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that.
Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' asshole!	Get the fuck out of here. Get out! Get the fuck out!
Get the fuck out of here.	I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money!
I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore!	All right. Be careful.
Yes!	Thank you. Very nice.
I'm sorry.	Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
Come on.	What's the matter?
Well, how 'bout that?	Come on! 
All right.	Okay?
Don't make me come there. Answer me.	I love you.
So, it's gonna be okay, isn't it?	Promise?
What does that mean? No, I know that look. What does that mean?	It means I got the money.
You're not gonna drive. Don't even think you're gonna drive.	No, I'm gonna drive.
There's more!	I think that's it.
Wow.	Boy, look at this place, huh?
How many of these you gonna eat, huh?	Two.
Give all the guys in your crew a piece of that?	I took care of everybody.
Yeah, thanks a lot.	But he never talked.
I do all the work. Somebody don't like it, fuck him.	It's up to you.
You must have drunk too much.	Go fuck yourself.
Who's this guy? Who's this guy?	Oh, he ain't nobody.
No more fuckin' dirty work!	No, no, no, no!
Hey! Oh!	Oh, sorry -
Hi.	Having a good time?
Works for me.	I don't know about you, guys, but I'm getting a little buzz off this.
You're kidding.	But it's true!  You can call him yourself.
Car wash, Captain?	Absolutely.
I loved you.	I know.
You're late.	Yes, Mother. Dear.
Hey Buddy!  Can you let me pull over?  Give me some space to pull over.	Where do you think you're going?
Was someone in an accident?	Do I hear a woman's voice?
I'm sorry for whatever's happened to you but we're definitely not the right people to do you any good.	Don't you have children?
Who's on the phone?	I'll explain later.  I'm sort of on hold.
What was that for?	You could've made me lose my call.
Are you guys all right?	You could've killed us.
Lady, don't let him do it!	You got it wrong.  I'm the one that's on your side.
He's seen both of us now.	Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
Lady, try making some sense.	You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
Hello?  It's just me and you again.	What about the others?
Make a right.  You can't miss it.	I'm making my turn.  I see the school up ahead.
Wait just a minute.  Our luck has changed.	What do you mean?
No.  I hear them.  They're coming upstairs.  They know!	Try what you did before.  It worked before.  I won't talk anymore.
It's locked.	Shit.  I'm sorry.
He had a gun.  I have it now.	Why are you telling him that.  Are you crazy?
Your friends are probably still on the line.  Pick it up and say hello.	There's no way out for you.  You have to deal with us.
Do you think they'll walk away?	Ask them.
You're making it too easy.	You got time on your side.  Pretty soon they'll be missed and we'll have the law up our ass.
Where do we meet?	It's a nice day.  How about the beach?
I'm here.  Where are you?	We don't see you.
Count it.	Don't worry.
Seems like it.	Put the girl on.
How far off are you?	Five minutes.
Who were you talking to?	Them.  They won't be expecting us.
Can I make a quick call?	Government business?
She wants me to tell you go fuck yourself.	I'm sorry.
You could always make it up to her.	How?
Just cut his hair, you know.	Yeah?
Saw that one.	What would you call it?
That's what he said. Jimmy.	Hi, Jimmy.
Ask him.	Ask him yourself.
You fucking promised.	Did I?
Thank you.	Who the fuck is he?
Take your clothes.	Don't throw my clothes out the window!
Do you mean that?	He wants to know do I mean that.
What's that supposed to mean?	It's a simple question.
You American?	No.
That should make her happy.	Who's she?
Jimmy.	Jimmy?
Everybody wants something.	Not me.
Hi.	Hi. You forgot your bag.
What was that?	They all get the wrong idea.
You all right?	Yes, thank you.
He's getting up.	You can't leave me then, can you?
Give me that look again.	What look?
Now's the time you're meant to do something, isn't it?	Like what?
You got a special friend, Jimmy?	How special?
Jesus Christ!	Jesus.
Would you like a drink?	Yes, please.
Someone out there.	Jesus fucking Christ.
He lived here with you?	Tried to. Sit down, will you?
He was different.	How different?
Do you miss him?	What do you think?
So what do you want with me, Jimmy?	Want to look after you.
You mean that?	Yeah.
Why?	If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
Drink.	What is this?
Did he ever tell you you were beautiful?	All the time.
You could?	Do you care, Jimmy?
I didn't mean to hit you.	I know that.
Kind of liked you as a girl.	That's a start.
Do they know?	Know what, honey?
Don't.	Sorry.
Don't ask me in.	Please, Jimmy.
It's her, isn't it?	What's her?
She own you, Jimmy?	Yes.
What you doing, Jimmy?	I'm not sure.
Why?	It's a secret.
You're no good at this, Jimmy.	I'm sorry.
So it's true, then?	What?
Why?	For me.
So tell me.	I was trying to get out of something.
Don't leave me tonight. Might kill me, too.	Okay.
Why?	Got to be somewhere.
And you'll never leave me?	Never.
Promise?	I promise.
What was it?	You know her, Jimmy?
See does he want some.	Do you want some food?
You don't know that.	Fucking do. I had him all over me.
Tough work, that.	Someone's got to do it.
And then you'll leave her out of it?	Aye. Then we'll leave her be.
And what if I say no?	You know what. Go.
You were made for this.	Was I?
Give him a cup of tea.	Do you want a cup of tea?
So he knows your name?	I told him.
Why do you want to do that for?	Would make me feel better about it.
So it was you all the time.	Who'd you think it was?
Fuck you.	Yeah.
Eat something, would you?	Can't.
What makes you think that?	They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
You make a nice couple.	Don't I know it.
What the fuck am I doing here.	What the fuck were you doing here?
Take it easy, now. Just go slow. Down by that tree.	Tree.
Now, that was worth waiting for.	Hurry up, would you?
Now put it back in.	Give us a break.
See? I was right about you.	Don't be so sure.
Where would you most like to be now, man?	Doesn't matter where.
See if she's all right.	I don't know her.
Don't.	I'm sorry.
Help me.	How can I?
Go to sleep now.	I don't want to sleep. Tell me something.
Nothing.	Tell me something, anything.
What if I did?	You'd know I wouldn't run off.
Not here.	Who gives a fuck.
I never know nothing.	People. They could be looking.
Oh, you should see your face.	What about it?
You don't look so bad in this light.	Why do you think I brought you here?
What is it?	Open up.
But I didn't kill anybody.	Then who did? You're the only one left.
I believe you.	Thanks very much.
Why not?	Because they're still here.
It's Charles!	Very good.
Do I knock or something?	Open it.
Back where?	That's the idea.
I'd love some, thanks.	I'm sorry.
What for? If it's not here, why bother him?	And if it is?
You loved him?	I'm very cold.
Is it all right?	I wish you wouldn't.
If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.	Is that all? Can I go now?
Of course it is.	And this?
I don't understand.	And this? And this?
What's going on?	Don't you understand French?
We're here.	Where?
Go on.	That's all.
Who is it?	The man you had the fight with.
He knows everything.	Don't you want me to stay?
Do you know him?	I've never seen him before.
Shoot no, not after all these years.	Then he gets it out of your share, not mine! Not mine!
It's almost ten o'clock.	Daddy you scared me!
Hi honey.	What's wrong?
What do you mean?	Well, I assume you let him kiss you?
It was a she.	Are you sure?
You know her?	It can't be.
No!	Run!
What are you doing?	This will relax her.
We just found another body.	Who's?
Pay no attention to me.	What are you doing here?
You fucked me up!	What?
You aren't going to the party?	You know about that too?
of COURSE. You're not scared?	Of course I'm scared.
Please! You wouldn't kill your sister, would you?	You think you're my sister?
Go sit next to him.	Who?
Someone tried to kill me.	The phone just went dead. I called the police and ran right over as fast as I could.
You ok?	FINE. Are you?
You can't tell your parents.	Ok.
This place is empty.	Everyone's getting ready for the party.
Cut it out.	Why?
You know, maybe we ought to start seeing other people.	What?
Are you coming to the party?	Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now.
You break up with me because I won't fuck you.	That's not why we broke up.
Please don't go. Please. Stay, We'll just talk. Then go to the party.	This party is sick.
My dad's down there!	He's dead! We've got to get the fuck out of here!
Thanks for coming back for me.	I love you.
Oh GOD IT'S HIM!	Quick! In the house. He won't look for us in there.
Wait.	What?
Who?	The men. Do any of them still live around here?
On what side of the family?	His mother's side.
You ok?	Just thinking about something.
What are you doing?	I got to go.
You can have both if you want.	No, you keep one.
You're so beautiful.	So are you.
I said no.	But you don't really mean it.
Maybe it won't stay in.	Maybe you better just drive me home.
Let me just ask you a serious question first.	What?
What, do you work for my boss, dog?	Okay, okay.
Aw!  Oh, Jesus.	Hang on.  Hang on.
Sorry, man.  He's dead.	 No.
Go on.	Would you hurry up, please?
We're clear.	Oh, man.
I don't want you to come anyway. 	What?
Keep still.	Okay.  Okay.
 	Bring him down!
Hey, just shut up.	We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!	We're gonna die!
We!	  I've got the real thing!
Stupid.	I'm gonna kill him.
Shoot me. 	 What's it say? 
What?	 
Hang on, hang on.	Let's go!
Oh!	Oh, oh!
Hey.	Hey, be cool.
All right, gentlemen. We're about done here.  Fine job.	Thank you.
 There's nothing in here, sir.  They got away with it.	All right.  Let's clear the mess and move out.
There.	Check it out.
Why?  You're a nothing, nobody!  Why?	You'd never understand!
Oh, caught a few, lost a few.	Story of my life.  Well, one thing you won't lose is that friend of yours back there, I'll tell you that.
Thanks. 	It must've happened right after we left.
  All right.	I'll lead 'em out.
How did she get that idea?	I think I gave it to her.
I'd like you to look at something, Mr. Cross.	What is it?
How much are you worth?	I have no idea. How much do you want?
She's just no good.	What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right.
They don't kill a guy for that.	Oh they don't?
You've done well by yourself.	I get by.
Congratulations.	Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
I don't want it anymore.	No?
What are you doing here?	Didn't you call?
Isn't that your number?	Is it? I forget. I don't call myself that often.
What are you talking about?	C'mon I'll show you.
It's too late.	Too late for what?
I know what he says.	Shut up.  Go on.
I don't suppose you got any idea Where she went?	Matter of fact I do.
That's it?	Yeah.
Who is he, get his name? I'll kill him.	Take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident.
No.	Do you know where she might be?
Would you like something to drink?	What are you having?
Is there anything else you want to know?	Where you were when your husband died.
We got it. We got it, baby.	What? What is it?
I'll stay.	Get in the car.
Boy oh boy, you're a mess.	Yeah.
Hold still. Why?	You can't always tell what's going on there.
What's wrong?	Your eye.
Okay, give me the keys.	You bastard.
She's too upset.	What about?
Just tell me the truth. I'm not the police. I don't care what you've done. I'm not going to hurt you, but one way or another I'm going to know.	You won't go to the police if I tell you?
Did you get some sleep?	Sure.
I said the truth!	She's my sister.
I said I want the truth.	She's my sister and my daughter!
Let me handle that.	I'm all right.
I'm sorry. We don't.	Don't be sorry, neither does Dad. Wanted to make sure though, didn't we, honey?
That's exactly what we wanted to hear.	Oh, good.
The water.	What about the water?
No, really?	I'm afraid so.
What's that, pal?	Nothing. You got a hell of a way to make a living.
Not exactly.	But that's what you told your wife.
Did you ever see her again? 	No. And nobody knows where she is.
I don't care. I'll wait.	For what?
That's fine, Mr. Kane.	I rather like it myself.  Send it right away.
He sure did, Mr. Kane.	Where is he?
Hey, Brad!  Brad!  He ain't been drinking before, Mr. Kane. Never.  We would have heard.	What does it say there?
It's wonderful, Mr. Kane.  Wonderful. Wonderful.	You don't really think so?
We'll be on the street soon, Charlie - another ten minutes.	It's three hours and fifty minutes late - but we did it -
Isn't it wonderful?  Such a party!	Yes.
What do you expect me to do?  What in the world -	Charles.
Oh yes, there is.	I don't think so.  Are you coming, Charles?
Charlie, you're just excited.  You don't realize -	I know exactly what I'm doing.  Get out!
Get out, both of you!	Charlie, please don't -
Yes -	As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
I won't let you go.	You can't stop me.
You goin', Mom?	Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
Mrs. Kane would like to see you, Mr. Kane.	All right.
Yes, Mr. Kane.	Not my wife - not either of them.
Oh, yes, sir.	Do you know what that is?
Tired?	It's been a tough day.
Say, Brad.  I've got an idea.	Yes?
First of all - 	What's wrong, Brad?
All right.	She's going to leave you -
She can leave me.  As a matter of fact, I've already left her.  Don't worry, Brad - I'll live.	I know you will.
I'll sign those papers -	You people seem to forget that I'm the boy's father.
Who told you you could sit down here?	Oh!  I thought maybe we could have a drink together?
How do you want to handle the whole thing - ask questions?	I'd rather you just talked.  Anything that comes into your mind - about yourself and Mr. Kane.
In case you've never heard of how I lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me -	The last ten years have been tough on a lot of people.
Are you sure?	Am I sure?
Thanks. Have a good one.	Do you mind if I drink this here?
Maybe you should take that coffee outside.	No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks.
I was here the whole time.	You two better quit it.
Why?	No, don't!
When did you get back?	Just now.
How'd you get here so fast?	I left like an hour ago.
Promise me it'll always be like that.	Like what?
I'm serious.	We didn't just have sex in the bathroom?
Stop this. This isn't funny.	I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside.
Are you sure somebody was back there?	I didn't just fuck myself! Jesus, I'm going to be sick!
I don't know. He just came in and asked to use the bathroom.	What time was this?
Wait a second? Who was working here today?	Just me.
Are you open?	Yeah.
This is the last time I come to this place.	Excuse me?
What the fuck is this?! I want some service!	In a second!
That's easy to say from over here.	Give me a stick, pretty boy! I'll knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass.
Are you open?	Yes.
You open?	Yeah.
No.	Why not?
You were saying?	Thanks for putting me in a tough spot. You're a good friend.
I could never reach.	Reach what?
I know it was a bad idea to close the store.	Listen to you.
I can't fucking believe you!!	I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault!
She said she did all the work.	WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?  WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM?
What? What's with you? You haven't said anything for like twenty minutes. What the hell is your problem?	This life.
That's all bullshit. You know what the real problem here is?	I was born.
Do you work tomorrow?	Same time. What about you?
Are you open?	Yes.
What? When? When did all this shit happen?	Hey man, that was a long time ago. Don't let it get to you.
Be careful.	I'm trying.
What? What is that?	She called you, didn't she?
Were you working here at about four o'clock?	I've been here since six o'clock this morning. Why?
Here you go.	What's this?
Sure. How about the beach?	I like the way you think.
That's the price, my brother.	Yo, I don't have that kind of cash.
Work!  Don't say that word, man.	Man, I hate work even when somebody else does it!
Did I hear somethin' break? Outside left!	Fuck you.
I'm coming out!	No, stay off the line!  You'll break her loose!
Forget me.  If you can, get away.	Would you?
Thanks for staying around when you didn't have to.	My pleasure.
What are we going to do?	Give him the money.
I'm going with you.	Not on that leg.
She's tough.	Is it really four thousand?
Use your other hand!  Grab it!	Help me!  I don't want to die!
Can't do it?  I don't believe this.  Don't you feel anything?	I only came back for you.
What was God thinking when he built this place?	If we don't get out of here soon we can ask him in person.
Can you see light?	Up ahead.
Reach up!  Do it!	Don't let me fall!
Thanks for holding on.	We were going together before I ever let go of you.
What's he doing?	The best he can since you gave him nothing.
You said there was a way across.	There is.
Go after her.	Hold on, baby, he'll get you.
Right.	Then it's a deal.
Don't use my name!	Ask the questions.
I don't trust him.	Kill him when he gets down.
Bring down the money or your friend's dead!	We can't and he knows it.
He's alive!	He can't be far away.  Find him. Go!
Good evening, sir.	Good evening.
So this is the young man?	How do you do, sir?
Who said that?	I did, sir.
Thank you very much for this chance, sir.	Let's hope you make the most of it, my boy.
How are you feeling today?	Fine. Fine.
Shall we go to my office?	Thank you.
Go ahead, say it.	No.  I got lucky with the lights.
No.	Oh, my, yes.
I was with Max when he got the call.	And you came all the way down here to see me?
I'm in town for a short time.	Try?
Hi, Ma.	I've been calling and calling.
You're kidding me.	I'll fuck you up, you don't hand it over.
I know you're out there!  Answer the goddamn call!	What happens if you don't?
Hello?	Oh.  Sorry.
We have a deal.  What's your name?	Max.
You cool, Max?  Say "I'm cool."	You're cool.
Good.  Help me out here.	With what?
Got it?	Yeah.
Max.	It's not me.
You listening to me?	Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
What about that?	I tried it.
You better?	I think so.
What are you doing?	It's a mess.
Music.	Play music.
Get rid of 'em.	How?
Don't take that.  Tell him to shut the fuck up.	I can't do that.  He's the Man.  He'll fire my ass.
Let's go.	No.
Max?  What are you doing?	Leave me alone.
Show up for what?	Tell her I can't see her tonight, okay?
Show up for what?	She's in the hospital.
You take one more step, I'll kill her.	You'd do her a favor.
How long have you been a hit man?	Why?
Would you have called her?	Who?
Max?	Let her go.
The sound of love.	Excuse me?
I never told her.	Why the hell not?
Are you crazy?!	The guy came right at us!
I was only going one way.	Drop me off here!
I still don't see what it has to do with the President.	Do you still ride?
I bit the bastard's nose off.	You bit someone's nose off?
What's the charge?	You were there, Jerry.  Figure it out.
I won't be here when you get back, but I'll be in touch.  And thanks.	For what?
What took so long?  You were in there all day.	That's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out.  A lot of people are after you, Jerry.
You have the right to ask me certain personal questions?	Yeah.  I think so.
That's it?	I have no idea.
Was that who I thought it was?	Uh huh.
Did you see the van back there?	What van?
I don't know what to say.  I love you.	What?
You look great.	Thanks.
Are you okay?  I wish I hadn't told you what I did.  But I can't help the way I feel.  You don't hold that against me, do you?	No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?
Now what?	This way.
After you.  It's okay.  I'm the one who left it here.	Where are we going, Jerry?
My father's house.	Come on.
Jerry.  Please.  You don't understand.  I have to know.  It's all I think about.  Do you have any idea what it's like not to know?	Yeah.  I know what it's like.
How'd you get the picture?	Your father, he was dying.  He was worried about you.  He took your picture out to look at it.  He called you his baby.
I believe you.	You do?
Don't die on me, Jerry.  Okay?	I can't promise you anything.
I love you, too.	Now she tells me.
Do I know you?	Yes you do, Jerry.  Quite well.
I'm a very patient man.	That's great.  Good for you.
Thank you.	You're welcome.  Where's my partner?
Can I ask you something?	A dog bit it.
Jerry told me he bit your nose.	And what did I say?
So, you doing anything tonight?	Working.
Yes.	Then this is a goddamn emergency.
Which way did he go?	I don't know.  Didn't see him.
Can I talk to you a second?	Go ahead.  We'll be right down.
Do you believe me?	Yeah, I do.
What gave me away?	Nothing.  I was just making sure. So, who are you?
Talk to him.	But what do I say?
Time to sleep now, Captain.  But you can ask more questions in the morning, okay?	Okay.
It's time to go home now.	No.  Please.
Someone tell me this is really happening.	It's really happening.
I read your book.	Really.
Hi.	Hi.
Yeah.	What are you doin' here?
Tell us about it.	You steal a car?
Then how come it ain't done yet?	I don't know, Boss.
Oh, man, did you see her? Did you see her?	I got eyes, don't I? How my not gonna see something like that?
Somebody say somethin'?	I didn't say nothin', Boss.
Where'd the road go?	That's it. That's the end.
Oh Lord!	That fool. That damn fool.
He'll never make it.	What are you talking about?
Now look what you did.	What did I do?
When are you going to call them?	About what?
You bastard!	But alive!
She just got to sleep.  Do you have to tell her about it now?	Tell her about what?
Kill me, Peter, do it, now.	No.  Not yet.
I'm going to put a guard on your door.	One officer already got killed trying to protect me.  Please, just take it all away.  Leave me alone.
We've got another one.	That's no surprise.
Why can't I drive home?  I will. You.  Look at you.  You need a ride home.  And you don't even know it.	Well, thanks.
Open the door.  Please.	Why don't you shoot off the lock?
He was in my apartment!	I know, baby.  I know.
I was.	I'm over here?  What's your name, Officer?
Working late.  You're a damn fool.	Oh, I know.
Answer it.	I'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't you at least interested in which one it is?
Absolutely.	My promise.
There, that's better.	Thank you.
That's going well, then.	Well, yes.  You're getting out of bed tomorrow. They want you to walk.
I think he'll be waiting for us at the airport	James.
You haven't told me where we're going.	Haven't I? To the airport, if you could.
Can you drive?	I can drive.
What does he want from you?	Hard to say.
First you tell me to do what I want to, then you tell me to stop.	All I want you to do is think about what's best for you. Really think about it.
What's up with you?	Me? Nothing. Tell me more about the job.
Just go ahead and tell us.	There's nothing to tell.
What do you think of this one?	I'd have to see it on.
What about this one?	You look beautiful.
Hi, Mom.	Look, Mom, I think I've found the dress.
Fuck me.	What's the matter?
Are you sure, Dear?	Come on.
Oh no.	Paul could pop the question at any time.
I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. It's going to be OK.	I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
I'll see you soon.	Tomorrow?
It's so good to see you, Sweetheart.	You too, Mom.
I'm only looking out for you.	And if I want to smoke, I'll fucking smoke.
I'm really not that hungry.	Just eat whatever you want. This will give you a chance to meet some people.
It had this red spot on its back.	Green spot.
I don't mean to go on and on like this.	It's OK.   It's good to let it out.
You can only do what feels best to you now.	I guess so. I think that's right.
A while, I guess.	That must be really difficult.
What are you looking to read?	Anything interesting.
Really, this isn't funny.	OK, OK, I'll give it back.
For a price.	Good God.
We're supposed to be asleep.	Exactly.
Then it's over.	Lie down.
It's a good thing my family loves you.	Your family just met me.
Well?	Home free.
Wow.	You like it?
Hey.	It's sex time.
Good luck.	You, too. Kick ass today.
The store was busy.	You got wine. That's great.
You're going to miss the Top Ten.	Coming.
How may I help you?	Congratulations.
What is it? Are you OK?	Always the drugs.
Don't upset my Mom.     Don't you upset my Mom.	Michael, calm down. Please. It's OK.
I guess we need to talk.	I guess so.
I sure know what that feels like.	And all the plans we have.
I'm sorry.     I didn't come here to blame you.	I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
What are we going to do?	What do you want to do?
Would that really be such a good idea for either of us?	Just promise me you'll be OK, OK?
I guess I should go now.	You should go.
What are you doing?    You're going to be late.	I'm calling in sick.
Of course not, no.  Is that why you're here?	I think we need to talk about some things.
No.	Especially this last year.
No, you've done a perfect job.	So, what do you say, Let?
You what?	I don't mean to hurt you.    I know this is a terrible thing.    And I have really loved you.
Getting back.	I heard about your friend.
Okay.   Okay.    I believe you.	You killed her!
Hey man, you can't do that!	What?   This?
Can I offer you something.    A drink? Coffee?	No thank you.
They knew who you were when they broke in your house?	Yes.
Tonight?	I know they won't be home tonight.
I don't know.	If you think because you're a women this can't go hard on you, think again.
Yeah.   We just go home.	We can't.
Get that, will you?	Why do I always have to answer the phone?
You think it's smart to tell him we're French?	I think he's already figured that out.
Fuck you! You know I'd never go along with something like this.	Do I?
We've got to be careful not to use our real names while we're in here.	Good idea.
Anybody hungry?	What'd you get?
Yeah?	It's me.
There's ten grand in here. It's yours. I'm going to call you again. There's one more thing I need you to do.	What?
But we ain't had nothing to eat all day boss.	Oh, I'm sorry.
What do we do?	I was told to take what we have and go.
They don't have a wine list.	Oh, then we will have the house wine.
I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I ever listen to myself?	Yeah, but you did do it.   So let's deal with that.
You guys used to work together?	Yeah and he can't stand it that I tried to do something to better myself.
It's good.	God, I want to go home.
What happened?	They sort of got away.
Anybody know about that car outside?	Yeah.   It's mine.
How are we going to do that?	I know where she went.
I think we went the wrong way.	Oh, you think?
Holy shit.	What?
How do we know what room she's in?	Wait here.
And how do we do that?	I don't know.
When do we go?	Tonight.
You like shoes?	No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
Who's gonna see it there?	The lucky ones.
Can't sleep?	No.
Who are you waiting for?	Stick around and find out.
So, I just come by to see how you're doin'?	You broke my arm. How the hell do you think I'm doin'?
What's this?	A car.
She's crazy.  You should have killed her.	I didn't have the heart.
Who are you?	Wait!  I'm a friend!
Where's your master?	What's it to you?
Hello.  What is your name?	Long.
I've missed you.	How so?
What do you want?	What I've always wanted, to teach you.
Let's stop a moment.	Give it back!
Keep it safe.  Return it to me when we are together again.	I will.
They're gone.	What does it say?
And you're gonna tell me who.	Who ever made that.
Don't thank me.  Your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit.	I knew that.
My name.	I'm sorry as hell, man.
My mom works over there.  I'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now.	Who?
Do you feel okay.	No.
Neither.	Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.
You'll be alone.	I'm already alone.
Don't waste my time.	Very well, it's your ass.
We've got company.	Is he inside?
I've got him if you want him.	No shooting.
Have we met?	I don't think so.
Are you okay?	I'll be fine.
You promise not to say anything?	On my mother's life.
Excuse me. Excuse me!	You talking to me?
I'm sorry, but you're not my type.	Fine. Friends it is. I can live with that.
It was fine.	I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?	It's not about being happy. You and I can't -
No, not at all.	Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.
Well, I was just calling to tell you I was thinking about you and I miss you. I'll let you go.	Wait, don't hang up.
Sure. Have a good night.	I will.
It's weird. I actually feel good about myself. Can we do this again next week?	Oh please.
That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad person.	Yes it does.
You know what? I don't take it back.	Why are you doing this?
You really want to know?	Yes.
I just came to say goodbye.	Where are you going?
Please don't go.	Get off me.
Hi.	Hi.
Hi.	Hi.
This isn't working out for me anymore.	Yeah, me neither.
It's not you, it's me. I'm completely fucked up.	What are you saying?
Why are you trying to hurt me?	I'm just being honest. I just wanted to see what you were like in bed.
Are you for real?	Do you want to learn or not?
See that wasn't so bad.	It was nothing.
Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never.	Okay.
Calm down. Tell me what's wrong.	Something awful happened last night.
Excellent.	You think he'll like it?
I'm sorry that was out of line.	I want to go home.
Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom and have her come pick you up.	My mom? Don't call my mom.
Just a kiss, right?	I swear.
What are you doing?	You promised to let me kiss you.
You think?	Is it me?
Jesus. We've been at this for six months.	I know.
Hi, mom.	Honey, is something wrong?
Is she with you?	Who is this?
Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you.	What?
You can put it anywhere.	Even there?
Fuck her yet?	I'm working on it.
That her?	Yeah.
Shut up.	What's your problem?
Morning!	Morning.
Bad time?	Kind of.
You didn't?	Oh yes.
Some other time.	Excuse me?
Why so nervous?	I've never done this before.
Well done.	Thank you. Now, where were we?
Get off me!	Will you calm down?
I got your message and came as quick as I could.	I hope I didn't keep you from something.
Let me get that for you.	Oh please. I can't have you do that.
Who the hell do you think you are?!	Excuse me.
I'll do that.	It's really important.
Did I ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me -	Yes, you already did.
What time is it?	Eight o'clock. You got to go.
Someone gave it to you? Where was this old house?	On the back street a green house
Where'd you get this, darling?	It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
Oh, thank you, darling.	You can't open it yet. You have to put all of them under the tree until morning.
Where is everybody?	It's early yet.
I haven't had my breakfast.	Well, you know where it is.
What do you mean you didn't play with the other children?	It was on account of the birthday party.
Yes, she was afraid. She said there was someone who wanted to kill me.	But there's no one here, darling.
Daddy?	Yes, darling.
What'd you get for Christmas?	I don't know yet.
Who are you?	You called me by my name.
No, I don't think that's very much fun. Let's play house instead.  You be the friend who comes to see me.  I'll show you my children.	Your children?
You mustn't be afraid.	But she's dead!
What?	Don't you hear it?
Hide me? Why?	My little girl said she'd kill you if you came to see me. I can't let you die. We'll have to hide you.
Hurry, hurry.	Yes, yes -
Hurry!	I can't do it! I can't do it!
You didn't even open my present and I'm your daughter.	My daughter died long ago.
Wow your body's really hot.	I've been working out.
Do you really need these?	Only to see.
So did you do it?	Did I kill him? Of course not!
What did he say?	I think he called you beautiful.
Get rid of him!	Okay, I gotta go.
Holy shit, I don't know.	Did you get rid of Mark?
You expecting someone?	No.
Fuck it's the cops. Peter saw me, now I have to let him in.	Tell them you'll meet them outside.
What the fuck are we going to do?	Hide him.
Peter knows something.	Well if he does, he didn't give you away. He must really like you.
You're kidding, really?	No, I'm serious. How about we have dinner and I tell you about it?
What, you got a date or somethin'?	Since when do you care?
You look different. I mean you look good.	You never say that.
Look what you did!	Oh my god, I'm sorry!
It's a matter of life and death.	This really isn't a good time.
Mark.	Yeah?
Except Mark of course.	What's that supposed to mean?
You at least owe me the truth.	You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
I knew you wouldn't kill me.	Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.
A kiss? Did you have sex with him?	No, I said it was our first date.
How the hell is that your business?	We're just trying to figure out what happened.
What?	And you think I'm sick?
He means the last that we know of.	This one walk you home too?
Police.  Nobody move.	He tried to kill me!
In there.	Just like that?
Was that for real down there?	I'm afraid so.
Good evening, sir.	Yes.  This way.
It seems fine.	Fine?  Look here!
Who is it?	Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.
Look!  This is a good one!	What is that door?
You see it?	Yes.
You remember nothing?  Who you are? What you've done?	You know something about me?
Bad dreams?	Yes.
If you like.	You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
Can I get my life back?	Maybe.
What are you hiding?	Nothing.  I don't know anything!
What's with her?	Don't worry about it.
What the hell is this?	What the hell is this ?
.. Nothing.	Great.
Fine?	Fine.
We think so.	Yes.
Clean.	What do you mean, he's clean?
What about the wife?	Clean.
What are you gonna do?	I'm going to kill him.
What do you mean by that?	Just what you think I mean.
Thanks. You did great.  Maybe later you could come back and we could go to Camp David or something.	That'd be great.
No.	I'm afraid so.
Fine.	Fine.
Let's call it a night.   I can't take any more.	Right.  We can pick up on the rest tomorrow.
Now he's making stuff up about me.	He's not.
You ever think back to how you started.	What?
Your government needs your help.	What?
So, how long have they been like that - - you know, him and the First Lady?	I can't say.
So you just protect the President the whole time?   That's your whole job?	Yeah.
You ever use it?	No.
I was waiting for that jack.	I had a feeling.
You bet.	I'm outta here.
That was quite a thing you did today.	Anybody would have done it.
You're leaving?	I'm not the First Lady, anymore.  I shouldn't be here.
How were you gonna get home?	I don't know.  I hadn't thought it out that far.
You don't have to keep walking with me.   I'm okay from here.	I don't mind.
Are you hungry?	What?
So what do you do the rest of the time?	You mean when I'm not running the country?
What?	I can't.
What's wrong?	Looks like we're not going to get a chance to get much done.
Yeah.   He's a good man.	What?
Hi.	Hi.
Did you get someone to double for me there, out front?	We're working on it.
Help me get him to the boat.	Leave him.
It's alright. I'm a friend. I need help and so do you. What's a safe place to talk?	Ain't no place safe.
He is dying. He knows it.	You are dying, too.
You fired that shot, didn't you?	No, sir.
Why doesn't he let you do what you want?	Yeah!  Tell him off!  It couldn't get any worse.
How was dinner?	Terrible.  Awful!  I met the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life!
What do you mean you don't know?	I'll tell you later.
All right.  I'll try anything once.	Except sex.
Oh God, it's over now!	Why? Nobody knows who we are.
It's such a strange name!  Won't you tell us what it means?	I told you, that's a secret.
I think he's sweet.	I think you're sweet.
Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do.  I'm just saying	Then don't tell me how to talk to my father when you're the same way.  All right?!
Who's in?	I'm in.
This is stupid.	It's better than doing nothing.
Don't stop.	Stop what?
That's your sister school, right?	Sort of.
Oh, hi.  I'm glad you made it.  Did you bring anybody?	No.
Of course I know you!  From the first time I saw you, I knew you had a wonderful soul.	Just like that?!  You just knew?
Oh Captain, My Captain, we came here so I could talk to you about something.	Okay.
What did your father say? Did you talk to him?	Yeah.
You really think I should forget her?	You have another choice.
All right!  What'd she say?	I don't know.
Where are you going?	I'm calling her!
You know me, always taking on too much.	Good boy.  Call us if you need anything.
Weird.	But different.
Look at this.	What is it?
So what do you think of my father?	I'll take him over mine.
Want to come to the study group?	Thanks but  I'd better do history.
I've found it.	Found what?
By the way, there's a meeting this afternoon.  You coming?	I guess.
Visit from my father.	Do you have to quit the play?
You the Captain?	Yes.
It's not going to help us!	We're going to die here! We're going to die!
Where are my men?	Dead.
Maybe we lost them.	Or maybe we're exactly where they want us to be.
I'm not staying here!	It ain't any better out there!
Now look what you did!	I saved your life is what I did!
I don't know where it is!	On the side!!
Got it?	Hey! I didn't have to come back.
Oh my god! Oh my god! How do we do it? How do we get there?	Not like him.
Let's just keep going.	You ain't giving the orders here!
What did you do the my kids!!	Me??
I'm telling you, man, we got to give the future some serious thought.	I have been.
Or maybe not.	Where is everybody?
Why don't you back off?	You want some too?
What was that?	Nothing.
Check it out!	Hey! You hear me? Come out!
Maybe it's the wrong ship.	Shut up!
She fucked you?	She fucked me.
She fucked us both.	Yeah.
Here. Here we go.  Here's to you, Nick!	Fuckin' A!
This is it. Definitely. This is it, but they changed it.	You're full of shit.
Fucking A.	Worse since she talked to who?
He's real bad, Nick.	Well, where the hell is he!!! I mean what are we all sitting here for!!!  WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???
You're back.	Yeah.
Did you ever think life would turn out like this?	No.
I have to go.	But you must come in.
She's in back.	Thanks.
Nick! Hey, Nick!  Boy! Boy oh boy! Are you okay? You're okay, huh?	Fine. Hey, I'm fine.
I don't know what we've been waiting for!	I don't know! I don't know either!
How are you?	Fine. I'm fine. How are you?
Nick?	Right here.
Who the hell is he?	Who the hell knows!
Won't we? Right? Am I right?	Right.
You should have put that on last night.	I know.
I just wait. You know?	Huh?
You think about it?	Yeah.
Is he from here?	Hell no!
Hey, Nick?	Huh?
I'm telling you, Nick, no one's going to come.	What are you, God?
Bullshit! That's bullshit!	You wanna bet?
Don't worry what it says in the book.	Right.
Well, who'd you get married to?	Aw, it's a long story!
What the hell's that for?	What's it for??
You're full of shit!	Yeah.
Funny guy.	Fuck you - fuck you.
What is it?  I'm about to go on.	We have to talk.
You have no evidence.  Arrest this man.	You want evidence.  I'll give you evidence.
You okay?	How do I look?
Need help?	I got it.  I got it.
Wanna come?	My insurance won't cover it.
Can I ask you something?	Yes.
Why?	I was set up.
She's pretty.	Thanks.
You need anything else?	I'll be okay.
I'll have a cup of coffee?	Never use it.  Stuff'll kill ya.
No.  I want to be with you.	No you don't.
You should be in hospital.	And you should be with your family.
You all right?	Yeah.
Hi.	Hi.
Funny.  Would you like to buy me a drink?	This little thing says I can't.
What's the matter with you?	You are afraid!
Well, I guess we won't be going to church today.	I guess we won't.
So you've made up your mind to go to the party.	You aren't angry with me?
There is nothing like a good old country breakfast. Where's Ma?	She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you.
The girl was off today.  Hey, I didn't expect you to sit up front.  So, your lady live out here?	The past six months.
How 'bout some Christmas music?	That is Christmas music.
One of yours?	No, sir.
Al.  Man, you were my rock.  I couldn't have made it without you.	Bullshit.
What's going on?	What's it look like?  We're going in.
If you're right I'm gonna back you a hundred percent, you know that.	Fuck you, sir - if I'm right, I don't need you.  What I want is - if I make an honest mistake I want help.
Jesus, you're the man!	Come on, what's under this?
Hey, don't take the car!	Well, how'll I get home?
I'll kiss the baby for you.	I love you.
Yeah.	What are you doin' in there?
You got these cops outta here. They're comin' in too close.	Come on.  I want you to see something.
This is it?  What am I gonna do with this?  Holy shit!	It's all we got.
Let's go to the back door.  How'd that guy get to be a guard?	Well, they go to guard school.
Do you think we can turn it on?	I don't know.
What is it, Sam?	Everything's all right?  You okay?
Thanks again, Sam.	I'm glad it's okay.
How did you know your son was involved?	It was on the TV.
It's the cops.  Shit!	How'd that happen?
You mean that?	What?
He wants one.	Dead or alive?
They're trying to come through the door!	Everybody!  Back here!
Jesus, you'd like to kill me, too.	I wouldn't like to, but I will, if I have to.
Okay - you got your one.	You follow my car. 
What are you trying to pull?	I forgot she's in here.
Fuck!  We did it!	Goodbye, honey.  Wish us luck!
Why are you doing this?	Doing what?
Morning.	Morning.
Who the hell is that?	That's the crew. They follow us.
So what?	You know what I'm talking about, did you fuck her?
God help us. God help us all.	It was the beginning of the end.
You were good.	Real good.
Ya back is got.	My brother.
Yo!	Yes?
You the man.	You the man.
No!	No!
What can you say?	I don't know how he does it.
I didn't know you had such beautiful hair.	Fool, there's a lot in this world you don't know.
Good morning.	Is it a good morning?
Where did you sleep?	I didn't.
Don't you have enough sense not to bother people when they're sleeping?	Wake up!
No.	Yo, I'm gone.
I'll see you out.	See ya around.
WAKE UP!	Fuck!  My money!
Let it be broke.	Can ya dig it?
I didn't say nobody, I said you.	Sweet Dick, I didn't mean it like that.
Hey!  What did I say?	Who doesn't work?  Don't start no shit, won't be no shit.
I know I haven't seen you in four days.  I'm a working man.	I work too, but I still make time.
Where are you going?	To get my money.
Act like one then.  Be a man.	Later.
You talk to 'em.	People are free to do what they wanna do.
I'll do that.	We're outta here.
I know this.	I love you.
Pop asked you.	I'm gonna kill somebody today.
Take it easy, Pop.	Don't start on me today.
You're it.	Guys. Give me the two fifty and go away.
Yeah, we're closed. So go away.	Actually we have something for you.
Oh my god, are you alright?	Yeah, I think.
But I came here to learn about America.	Baby listen, there's nothing more American than not doing anything and getting away with it.
Excuse me?	Come over around seven.
Okay, there's a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you.	Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me? Hard for me?  You had questions?
HARRY? Are you okay?	Are you kidding? I couldn't be more okay.
Okay.	Okay, what?
You're going to be just fine, HARRY.	I know I am, Mom.
Mom, you know that never works.	Right.
I think it's just over there.	Is that what I think it is?
You know, you're the first person I've brought here.	Oh, is this your special place?
You're it.	Oh, no. You're not gettin' me again.
These are really cold, huh?	That's why you have to drink it fast, trust me.
What?	Our own special bus.
Nope. I was right.	Wanna bet?
HARRY, can you hear me?	Yes.
You have beautiful eyes.	You have beautiful eyes.
Hey, where did you come from?	Hey, where did you come from?
HARRY, would you like to share with the rest of us what's so funny?	You wouldn't get it. Just a private joke between best friends.
No one knows?	Me, me, me!
George Washington!	Who?
If you have to ask, you don't know.	Yeah, that's why I asked.
You're it.	Am not.
She's one of a kind.	Try one in a million!
Sorry, Charlie.	Hey, where'd you go?
So what did you say to my parents on the phone?	Not to expect you tonight.
Yes, what?	Don't answer me. Say what I say.
So, when can we do it?	Tomorrow night?
What are you doing?	Let's just do it and get out of here.
I'm so close I can feel it.	Me too. I'm almost there.
Hey you two. Lights out.	Hey can be on top?
Left here! Left!	You bet I left him, took the dog and we was history.
I am strong!	Yes you are. 
God, I've missed you.	And I you.
Knock knock.	Who's there?
Oh, just like the President.	Just like the President.
What's that you're saying?	Nothing.
What's in the box?	Pain.
Yes. Perhaps he would at that.	My father sent you to test me. Music then?
Say, that's a funny place to sleep.	It is my home.
Goodbye!  Goodbye!	So how'd we do?
Eddie, this is quite a scene.	I know it's a lot to give you at the last second.
What are you doing?	I was thinking about killing myself.
Don't worry.	I'm sorry, Eddie.  I'm so sorry.
I've got some good news.  The doctor says you're all better.  You can come home.	Really?  I don't feel so great.
Which one is the red one?	What do you mean?
Wow.	And who may you be?
I'm no good.	Ed, it's just one man's opinion!
You're a fuckin' mess.	So WHAT??  Look, we gotta figure out where we're gonna stay.
Eddie, which dress do you like better?	I don't know.  Hey Bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one?
I kinda need it now.	What are you looking at me like that for?  I already gave you my three hundred.
Oh, it's you again.	Oh, hi.
You're not gonna believe the first picture I ever saw.  Your friend's.	What do you mean?
Does this mean you don't like sex with girls?	No! I love sex with girls.
Stop!	STOP!
Look, it's Dr. Tom.  Hey, Dr. Tom!	Who's Dr. Tom?
Ed, I'm so happy for you.	Let's get married.
You're sure this is gonna work?	Yes!
Yeah. I brought you some movies.	Anything good?
Have I ever said a bad word to you about your father?	No.
How's your mother?	Al!
You thought it was me?	Yes!
Did you see that?	What?
You think she really likes him?	She doesn't give a shit about him.
Ed, can I see you a second.	Excuse me.
Yeah.	You asked me if I had a dream. I said "Sure, I have a dream. I just don't know what it is yet."
I don't think so.	Yeah. Because, you didn't talk me into anything. Everything you wanted me to do, I wanted to do.
He's who we want to go with.	This guy.
You know who we are?	Tell me.
Hey, if it's free, it's me.  You ready?	Yeah. You did good. What's wrong?
What?	The doctor said you were having sex.
Don't tell Al. He doesn't know.	Well, he's the only one in America who doesn't!
She won't.	What are you talking about?
How much less?	Never would be plenty.
You do though, you look great.	Right.
Really?	Yeah.
What are you doing?	I missed you.
I need to talk.	Are you all right?
It's not their fault.	No. It's your fault.
This is going right up your ass.	Come on.
What's up?	Where were you?
You know, that would be like a great thing.	What?
All right.	Yeah?!
What are you, hiding from the Police?  Show your face, you look great.  Doesn't she look great.	Great.
Who is it?	It's me, Ed.
Come on, Ma.	Let's remember how I got into this. "Please, Eddie, do this for me. I can't get a break." 
Hello.	Hi.
Who is it?	It's Ed.
Hi.	Hi.
Oh!!	We have to stop meeting like this.
Are you busy tomorrow night?	No.
It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.	Here, get down.
You gonna do it? You gonna do it?	Yeah, uh, just a minute
Yeah. No. I mean, you know.	What?
Having a problem with your eye there?	Dick.
All right.  Well, sure nice to meet you.	So nice
Okay.  But we're still missing something key here.  What are we missing?	I know.
Looks good to me.	Aren't you supposed to keep them?
Thanks for everything.	You bet.
Yes?	Looks like today's your lucky day
What's this?	My house.
What a surprise.	Take as much room as you want
Could you get this? I can't	Sure.
So what do you think?  Should we get a room?	Should we get a what?
What do you want, Jim?	You're there.
Where 're you going?	I'm not like you.
Are you crazy?	What?
She's doing this to get back at me	For what?
Who put you up to this?	What do you mean?
Yes, Paul?	Have a great summer.  And good luck at college.
How's the left these days?	What's it to you?
Somebody hit you?	It's not what you think.
You know him?	Seen him around.  He used to be a cop.
Hey, partner.  Grab a cup.	I got to write my report first.
What's through here?	No!  Please leave!
She's fine.	I'm not asking you.
Thanks, but no thanks.	Against your code?
Anything?	Nothing.
I heard you like to shoot dogs.	Dogs got no reason to live.
You should stay away from a man when his blood is up.	His blood's always up.
You're the key witness?	That's right.
I need to speak to you.	Give me a minute, will ya?
I'm curious about you.	Why?
How was I?	Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
Have we met before?	Yeah.
Was it a party?	Something like that.
And you were the last one to talk to him.	Yes.
I just gave him my card.	He didn't give you an address? He didn't give you a phone number?
You've got it on tape?	Clear as day.
No one. But I'm a little nervous.	When can you get it here?
You knew the deal. No contact.	Who was that other guy?
Did you call anyone?	What do you mean?
What the fuck?!	They shouldn't have come without calling first.
Gimme that.	You sure?
We lost 'em.	That wasn't so hard.
Drive.	We're not gonna hurt you.
He came in four minutes ago.	C'mon.
Is it okay?	You got any money?
Do you see anything you like?	I'm married.
Did he give you anything?	No.
You're a lawyer. Don't you care what's going on around you?	Something bad happened tonight.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.	That's okay.
Are you sure you're safe?	Yeah.
Is it over?	It's over.
I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand. You wanna fuckin' what?	I'd like to speak to someone about what's happening to me.
And then what?	I'll see if I can, you know, work things out.
Good. You're just what I need right now.	You got a minute?
I can't.	You have to.
Fuck you. When you needed information, I got it. You didn't care how.	I did care how.
Jesus! What?! You want money?!	Shut the fuck up.
Hey!	Forget me, forget what I did for you. Don't ever mention my name or try to contact me again. Get it?
He's kidding.	Where's mom?
Dad!	Do I know you?
It's okay to use the phone.	Alright!
I'm sorry, man.	No. No, it's okay.
Well we'd sure like to help you.	You would?
What happened?	He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.
Now is that clear?	Yes sir.
How much did you pay?	Hello!  Good morning.
Why did you follow me yesterday?	Excuse me?
What is he saying?  Come on, what did he say?	He said - be careful.
Actually, you sing.	Pardon?
This is not very good, is it?	No.
Do they know them?	No, but I think I do.
Will you not come in?	No.
When were you most happy?	Now.
Say you're sick.	What?  No!
I can still taste you.	This is empty, just coming!
Why did he bring you?	A surprise, he said.
Why did you hate me?	What?
It's so cold.	I know.  I'm sorry.  I'll make a fire. I'll be back.
Shall we be all right?	Yes.  Absolutely.
A broken car?	Still a car.
Good morning!	Could I trouble you for some water?
How are you?	Okay.
Is this you?	I don't know.
Excuse me -	Yes?
I liked it better when there were just the two of us.	Why?  Is he staying?
I'm still here.	You'd better be.
Why don't you go?  You should sleep.	Would you like me to?
For my hair?	Yes, for your hair.
Why would anyone do this?	I've done this.  I've had to do this.
Will you come with me?	Of course.  When?
He's gone, hasn't he?	No.  He's - no.
This is wonderful!	What's he saying?
They've never caught him before, what makes you think they'll catch him now?	You got a better idea?
We've got to catch him in the act.	Why didn't I think of that?
You have a car?	Uh, yes.
I've got something for you.	Oh, that's quite all right. No charge.
And I thought we were getting on so well.	We were, we are, but this is perfect for you.
For God's sake.	I'm sorry. This just means so much to me.
Very nice.	Not a word.
It's a test.	That's my girl.
He says they turned the card down.	Damn, I knew I forgot something.
What the hell was that?	Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out.
It's one way.	We're only going one way.
Those are my clothes.	Certainly not mine. Come on.
I don't believe this.	What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
Lose something?	I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.
And good morning.	Good morning.
Nice try. Everyone thinks I did.	That's because I wanted them to!
I didn't mean to get personal.	Yes you did.
You bought this for me?	Don't get any ideas. Of course it comes out of your share.
Thank you.	Thank you.
We're working.	It's a party.
Ready?	Ready.
They moved it.	Behind you.
Now's when you tell me who you really are.	What?
Your share.	Get the hell in.
We're living history here.	You don't know the half of it.
Do you know what you've done!? Do you know?	Would you quiet down! Just for a minute?
So how long till we do this?	We're doing it tonight.
No way to take another day or two?	No. You'll see when we get inside.
So what are you going to do with your share?	Oh, I don't care about the money.
Jesus.	You can do it.
Come on.	No way.
Hang on.	Get out of here!
I cannot get rid of you.	No, you can't.
Put this on!	I'm not leaving without you.
Right.	Because I never assume anything.
Oh, it is.	It better be worth it for me.
You two make quite a couple.	We're supposed to.
This is just show and tell.	I'm waiting for the tell part.
Takes a lot out of you, one like this.	Yes it does.
See you.	Probably not.
Where've you been?	What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
What's she doing here?	Who?
The judge came up with a number.	A number for the whole group, or for us?
Oh, my God.	And he's making them give five million of it to you all.
I can put them in a good school.	Any school you want.
You do know how to do that, don't you?	Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.
You're a girl.	Excuse me?
I like this case.	Really?  It makes me sick.
Hey.  I like working with you.	Well, good, Ed.  I like working with you too.
What kind of truck?	I don't know.  Big.  Dark.
I don't know what to say.	Say you were wrong.
But I know you're not gonna quit on me.	How do you know that?
What is that?	Take it.
Look, I know you're mad.  But the way this job is, things come up at the last minute, real important things, and I gotta deal with them.  Now I don't like me missing dinner any more than you do, but we're all gonna have to get used to it, cause the fact is, it's gonna happen sometimes.	It happens all the time.
What are you doing?  Where's George?	I don't know.
Yeah.	Thank God we got you away from her, huh?
You want my number?	I do.
No.	C'mon.  I bought 'em for you, to make up for that night.
I'm not gonna leave my kids with you.	Why not?
What're you doing?	Better safe than sorry.
You think it could make you sick, living in a place like this?	What do you mean?
Great.	I'm gonna clean it up.
You mind telling me what that's supposed to mean?	Nothing.
That's Ed.	Lock the door.
What's going on?  What are you doing?	Thinking.
About this.	What's that?
They said that'd be tomorrow.  They just wanna keep an eye on me another night.	Fine.  I'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon.
Hello?	Hi.  It's me.  I got a favor to ask you.
Think you could learn?	You know me.  I pick things up real fast.
You shouldn't be driving around, you know. You're sick.	Yeah, but I'm gonna get better.  A lot of these folks aren't.
What time is it?	Real early.  We're just gonna take your car to get some breakfast.
Promise you'll turn around if you get tired.	I will.  Bye.
There's something else, too.	What?
My lord.	Come in, Admiral.
Give me that!	Mine!  Mine!  Or I'll help you not.
It sounds like it's trying to get in.	I'm going to see what it is.
Well, you said you wanted to be there when I was wrong.	I take it back.
Sure.  I guess I make it difficult sometimes.	Yes, you do.
Stop that.	Why?
There's something out there!	Where?
I don't like this.	It'll be all right.  Trust me.  And keep your eyes open.  You wait here.
I was worried about you.	I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
All this just to get the kid? What's so important about him?	Don't ask me, but he's on his way.
What's going on?	I'm coming over to your side, that's what.  And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.
Look, I stand to lose everything by this.	We have no use for your kind.
What'd you say?	I didn't say anything?
What??	Oh my, no!
Ben?  Ben?	Free your mind and return he will.
Nobody's going to believe it.	Believe what?
May I say something personal?	Please
I need a favor.	What's in it for me?
I'm already dead.	I see your point. What's the favor?
Stop the damn car.	No way.
Where is it?	Right over there.
Me too?	We'll see.
I don't know about this thing.	Don't like it, don't come.
What're you doing in here?	Looking to get out.
Don't follow me.	You need help.
All of us?	Yeah.
How? Where?	In the great book.
Why didn't he kill us?	He has given up.
They do.	Why?
Now you must pay me.	I?
What honey?	Fuck it.
Hello?	In here!
Hi	Hi, how'd your day go?
Here.	Oh great, anything else?
Where do you want this?	What is it?
I'm gonna miss you.	Me too.
Would you like some more coffee?	Please.
Oh, she'd love it.	What's her name?
Thank you.	You're a nice man.
Excuse me Miss?	What!
Do you keep any drugs in your house?	No. Of course not, nothing like that.
Wanna drink.	Please.
No it's alright I'll take it straight.	Are you sure?
Yes. He's already here.	Father?
Is she gonna die?	No.
Oh look at that.	You like it?
Hey, where'd this come from?	I found it.
You've been playing with it?	Yeah.
Wait a minute you need two.	No you don't. I do it all the time.
Yeah	Okay. And tomorrow night, I'll take you to a movie, okay?
People get tired.	Why does God let us get tired?
Oh my God!	Make it stop! What's wrong!! I'm scared!!!
I don't want it.	Honey it's to help you.
Goodbye Father. I call you.	Okay.
Think you can sleep?	Are you gonna steal my shoes now?
Lieutenant?	I came to say goodbye.
Did you do that?	Uh Huh.
Do it again.	In time.
What's that?	Holy water.
I'm all right.	How's your leg?
Your Uncle John stopped by to visit me.	Oh really, when?
Is that too tight?	No.
What is it?	Her heart.
You're not my mother!!!	Don't listen.
Hey, Father? You like movies?	Very much.
Miss?	Yes?
No.	Why not?
Give me the keys.	You're not going to drive.
What's this?	Your pay.
They gotta go.	How many?
What do you say we go for a walk, pal.	Get your hand off me.
Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could make it.	How we doing?
Count it.	Huh?
You know, I think it's been five years since I saw you eat anything. That's the God's truth.	Trust me, you're not missing anything.
By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow.	No thanks.
So what'd we get her?	You'll see.
I made her nervous.	What do you mean?
What's with Charlie?	Nothing.  Everything's great. Terrific.
Yeah?	It's me.
So you'll come out, right?	Yeah, okay.
Nice, huh?	What?
Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?	I don't know what you mean.
Look, can we forget last night? We gotta talk.	Talk.
Jack.	Let's get it over with.
What are you, crazy?	I just thought we should talk about it.  Between ourselves.
What's the matter?	I didn't get her number.
Where the hell is she?	It's early.
You hit me.	I told you I was gonna hit you.
No.	Here, how's this?
See anything?	How about these?
You all right?	Yeah, fine.
I'm putting my stuff on the right, okay?	Okay.
You leaving that on?	Yeah.
How's it coming?	Fine.
Funny, huh?	What?
You saw wrong.	Huh?
What're you doing?	Just until we find another girl.
We're not getting paid then.	No.
Jack, you're on television.	Shut up, Frank.
I didn't hear you come in.	What're you doing?
Go ahead.	No.
Looks like these got a few years on them.	This'll kill 'em.
Charlie called.	Yeah?
You're an hour and a half late.	My watch is broken, too.
When?	When we know.
Come on.	Hey!
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.	Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?
Shoes?	Right.
Fucking.  She says fucking in front of an entire room of people.	I said I was sorry.
Oh yeah?	He's just afraid to show it. Aren't you, little brother?
What's with you guys?	Someone needs to grow up.  I won't take it, Jack.
I can't sing it anymore.	What?
Funny hours.	Funny job.
You want to know if he's okay. Right?	Yeah.
No.	I'm tired.  Really.  I should get home.
It went well tonight.	Frank works hard.
You miss him, don't you?	It's been a long time, Ma.
He do that every year?	Every year.
Oh, sorry.  With the light always on, it's hard to tell.	It's okay.  Last one.
It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.	Just dinner and dance, right?
I can keep the beat.	Better than that.
What's the matter?	Nothing.
History.	Huh?
The both of them?  In there?	He called her.
Oh. Hi.  Sorry.	Coffee?
You can always get another girl.	There's always another girl.
Saw the sign outside.  Got your own sign, huh?	Yeah.  Got my own sign.
What kind?	Huh?
Jack.	Hi.
Let me get the light.	No.
Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.	Another five years, huh?
Did you break a cup, Jack?	Eddie did.
Guess they're up.	Sounds big.  What's he do?
How'd the show go?	Okay.  How'd yours go?
Jack.	Yeah?
John.  It's good to see you.	Good to see you, Ma.
So. How are you?	Fine.  You?
Big piece or little?	Huh? Oh, no.
How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?	Eddie.
What did he do?	He hit a guard.
Where am I?	My place.
Perfect fit.	Should be.  It's yours.
You'll what?	I'm going to have you fired.
You've got someone in your office.	Get rid of them.
Commander, what are you doing here?	Where should I be?  Where's everyone else?
What is with you tonight?	Don't I usually kiss my wife?
Jack, are you okay?	What going on here?
No.	So what are we gonna do, Jack?
They did a pretty good job.	Who did?
Where do I go now?	Big Ed.
Is it morning yet?	No, honey. Go back to sleep.
So Jack, it your wife birthday, got anything to say to her?	It your birthday? Today?  What your name?  Where were you born?
DO YOU WANNA DIE?!	No.
How'd you know my name was Jack?	I call all you white guys "Jack."
Yeah?  What do you need?	Me?
Miss me, Jack?	That my car!  You stole my car!
Figure it out.  You got plenty of time.	How much time?!
Are we finally being honest?	It would help me if we were.
I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank.	Nice night for it.  I'll have Louis send your car home.
Where were you?	I was in the city.
How can you do that?	Do what?
No?	Do you have any idea what my life is like?
I want to see you again.	I'd like that, too.
Don't you have anywhere to go?	I've got plenty of places to go.
I don't think She's real big on hate.	You wouldn't say that, if you could see me.
We're going to have to work on your touch.	I like the sound of that.
I can't take this.	Ben.  This is business.  Just work.
What about his first born?	Ben, the money's not important.  We could save lives.
When have I asked you to do something you absolutely said you could not do?	Five times.
How long was I out?	Three days.  I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
We had a tough year.	Yeah, nine years straight.
What did you wish for, honey?	I already got it.  Everything I want.
What are you doing here?	I'm worried about you.
He didn't.	Oh, he did.
This is wrong in so many ways.	You've been working out.
You're hot!	So are you!
Stop it.	Okay, "mom."
What is that thing?	I think that thing is Ben.
I'm driving.	Dude.  That's my sister.
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?	Not at all.
Not until Ben is back inside!	It's too late for him, and soon it'll be too late for all of us.
I, uh, think I remember the number.	It's been changed.
Feeling better?	Yes, thanks.
What?	We need to get past them.
How come Ben can't turn it on and off like us?	That's what we're here to find out.
I mean, you broke up with me, right?	Are you kidding?
What is it?  Anything wrong?	I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.
Then how come it worked loose?	I have no idea.
May I?	Go ahead.
What'd you do that for?	I'm married.
This is a new car, then, sir?	It certainly is, officer. Still got that smell!
Or your fucking wife, you know.	Or your fucking wife, Jerry.
Clear him off the road.	Yeah.
Both of these.	Oh, no, I can't let you do that.
Uh-huh.	We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
No.  I found something new.	Really, what's that?
That's a fucking great, man!  Fucking great! Congratulations.	Yeah, both of us.
Is that your blood?	Some of it, yes.
We need to talk.	Sure.
Looks like this is goodbye.	Let's not make a big thing out of it.
It's time for you to leave.	Don't worry, I'm leaving.
Where?  Here?	Here.
Make sure.	Okay.  Okay, I'm sure.
You hear that?	Hear what?
Hello?	Who's this?
I guess so.	And, now it's gone.
Insurance'll cover it.	Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
I don't know about this.	I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?
How do you feel?	Strange.
My boss, probably.  Who would you fight?	My dad.  No question.
Where's your car?	What car?
You're sure?	Yeah, I'm sure.
You're okay with this?	I'm fine.
You get rid of her.	Don't mention me.
No thanks, I quit.	You quit?
I feel sick.	Imagine how he feels.
Hey.	Hey.
Something on your mind?	No.
I don't know!  Nothing!	If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
What are you talking about?	Nothing.
One minute.	I think this is about where we came in.
What are you doing?	What have you left for me?
Do something for me.	What?
He don't own this place, I do.  How much money's he getting for this?	There is no money.
Would you rather be dead?	No, please, no, God, no!
Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.	Taken care of.
Please.  It's not going to wait.	I've got to stop and help those people.
We had a fight.  Some things got broken, the dog went crazy, she left me.  Wouldn't say where she was going.	What was the fight about?
Shouldn't we pull over?	No time.  Keep going.  I wouldn't know how to explain any of this anyway.
Welcome back.  We did it.  For real.	I know.  I can feel it too.
Want me to drive?	No, I'm good.
Can I ask you a question?	Sure.
And you're gonna die after me, right?	I guess so.
I know it's crazy, but I'm really scared for the others.  I've got this terrible feeling.	What feeling?
I'm sorry.  I'm just so happy that you're safe.	I love you too, Dad.  Goodnight.
Mom?	Yeah?
This place?!	Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to.
Most kids do, I guess.	Most kids never have it happen.
Stop the car!	Let us out!
Can't you open the door?!	Easy, Billy, just open it.
Get out! Get out of the car!  Get out of the fuckin' car!	Get out! Get out of the car!
You know what to do.	No! No! Don't!
It broke!	No one's that strong.
Knock it off!	May as well go out under my own free will, right?
Get control of yourself!	That's what I'm doin'!
SHUT UP, BILLY!	WE DON'T NEED THIS NOW!
Wow!	What just happened?
Gettin' old, huh?	Yeah.  Second set.  Let's go.
Yeah.  Why not?	You break your leg, I'll have to shoot you.
You okay?	Keep it down, man.  I got problems.
That guy's not going to make it.	Nothing we can do, man.
You better take off.	Ain't you coming with us, sweet thing?
Christ.  How'd you get here?	Took bus, most of way.  I knew you would come here.
Yes you can.	How?
John.  My name is John.	It doesn't hurt.  Why doesn't it hurt?
All this is for us?	That's right.
Who're you?	American.  Come to get you out.
Hello, John.	Colonel.
This your stuff?	That's it.  My life.
What have you been doing here!  Huh! I wanna know!  What have you been doing here?!	Listen!  We both got something out of it, all right!
Do you know what the Little People just told me?	The Little People?
But I gave it to you!	Well what am I gonna do with it?
He knows who you are!  He's afraid!  I can tell!	You're totally gone, aren't you?
Listen, he just needs to sleep it off. Someone will take care of him.	Who?
Are there any questions?	What?
Come on! Go for it! What the hell are they gonna do? They can't do nothin!	Nothing! They can do nothing! Gentlemen!
Tell me more. I want to know everything.	There isn't any more to tell.
You like it?	I love it.
Just one minute, you! Don't you ever talk to me like that!	Shut up! All of you!
It's all right. He don't mean anything by that.	I don't, huh?
How far are you going to?	Washington.
You don't have to tell everybody about it. Pretty soon they'll all go there and it won't be so clean.	How do you know it's clean?
Can I get you anything else?	No. How much do I owe you?
I just can't look at you.	Don't, then.
How long have you been staying here?	A couple of months.
I mean, you think I'm that happy?	No, I don't.  You should've left a long time ago.
Well, you're not going to run out on me right away, are you?	I don't know.
Look at that.	Why are you being so mean?
Where is she, anyway?	My turn.
Where are you going?	I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?
Four or five years.	No, the last time was three years ago.
See? There's nothing wrong with the way I walk. Now where are we?	At game, Carl.
Yo.	Hi.
So you got a girl?	Of course.
So what you think of me?	You look good.
Come down!	I can't!
Like this?	Yeah, that's right, you got it girl.
You wanna do somethin' with me?	Not really.
Never heard of him. Thanks anyway.	You mean her.
Hey you're really nuts.	They didn't do anything.
This one's going to be even more fun.	Go ahead. Make my evening.
I've got it all under control, Jerry. You can go now.	Under control? You idiot. You didn't know who he was?
So what do you figure?	No idea.
Jesus.	You don't know me.
Are you all right, Doctor?	Where am I?
Here you are, Doctor.	Thank you.
Has he?	Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?
I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them.	Where are you going?
We can't talk about it here.	Why not?
Will you kill me?	Sure.
Yo!	Can I steal you for a minute?
Did you hear something?	Not me.
Thanks.	You doing a story on this guy?
Did you say cops?	Yeah.
Cute young thing, too.	I'm sorry?
Hi.	Hi.
I really should change.	No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.
Thanks for the great time.	What is this?
And they're leaving the country tomorrow night.	Bastard.
Don't worry, I can take it.	You shouldn't be here.
Where is she?	Moved out.
No thanks.  I carry my own.	Excuse me?
Have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?	Right away!
I'm afraid so, you want her?	But you know, that was just a dream.  Doesn't really count.
So, did you find my dad?	Well, I got some good news and some bad news.
It doesn't have to be like this?	Oh God, please, don't!
How's everything?	Everything is everything.
Who knows?	Where do you want it?
Are you sure it is dead?	I'm going to put them on the cat.
All right, get up on that bar and dance.	What?
I'm sorry, I don't know who you mean.	He got off on six.
Never trust anybody.  You goin' sick?	Not a chance.
Why not?	Let yourself in.
Same car.	Third time around.
It looks open on the other side.	Don't know what's behind it.
Gotta be another way up, Frank.	Then fuckin' find it.  I'm going for the girl.
How about a little of the King?	Well, why not a little of the King?
Damn.	You alright?
Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow.	He ain't the only one.
I'm off.	Wish you weren't.
Lucky throw, fire boy.	Luck, my ass.
Okay, I'm on it.  Hey.	Hello, Frank.
What do you mean?	Do you know where I found this?
I'm scared.	Don't be scared.  This time I'm right behind you if you fall.
Yes!  That's it!  You got it, you got it! Way to go, Chief!	I'm doing it!  I'm doing it!
Sorry 'bout that.	What'd you just say?
Oh my god.	What?
How could this be happening?	I don't know.
What's that?	I think I'm losing you.
What are you talking about?	I lost you.
Dad, you there?  You okay?	Yeah.  I'm okay.  What about you?  I want to know.  About you.  And your mom.
We're doing all right, Dad.  We're doing good.	Tell me.
John, you still there?	I'm right here, Dad.
He killed her John.  He killed her and I didn't do a thing to stop it.	It's not your fault, Dad.
It's gonna work, Dad.  We're gonna stop him.	Hang on.
John, you there?	Yeah, Dad.  What the hell is going on?
I'm here, Dad.  I'm here.	We did it, John.  We stopped him.
How you feeling?	Better.
My father didn't die in a fire?	Huh?
She makes ten.	Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.
Got a minute?	Yeah.  Sure.
Hey, future boy.  Frank tells me you're a cop?	Yeah, that's right.
You used to be on the job?	Yeah, long time ago.  I know you?
Who the fuck is this?	Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
What're you gonna do?	Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
Think you can figure it out?	I'll think of something.
Do you want a beer or not?	Sure.
What's this?	Your bed.
You haven't changed a bit.  Always so sure of yourself.  Even when we were kids, when you wanted something, nothing could stop you.	Is that so bad?
This door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it?	What?
Look what I found.  Remember these?	Did you stay here last night?
What happened that night?	You promised you'd never ask me.
Could we move a little faster?	Sure, just watch where you're going.
You know him?	Sort of.
Faster!  Eat faster!	Why don't you help us?
See anything?	Just a dirty window.  Next time, I'll know how to handle a situation like that.  Let's just hope that "next time" isn't too soon.
I don't see anything.	Keep looking.
Got any good ideas?	Maybe.
Why do you do these stupid things?!	I have to.
Don't worry about it.  Just stay cool.	Stay cool?  You ain't Dirty Harry. Now stop it.
Is that all you found?	I wish it was.
What?	Hide it behind the gas station. Then we can get the hell out of here.
It's all over.	It's just beginning.
Okay, give it back.	Come and get it.
They did show up.  Isn't that great?	I hope so.
You mean you had a bad dream.	No, he was real.  Like on TV.
Where'd you get this?	I found it outside.
Hi.  Everything's all right now. We're here.	Yeah, we're here.
Anything else?	Yes.
I know who you are.	I need to talk to you.
What do you want?	You know what I want.  You know why I need you.
Everything going okay?	It's going.
I gotta get back to work.	Okay, I'll call you later.
Everything'll work out.  Trust me on that.	Okay.
Maybe you should be moving on.	Maybe you should mind your own business.
Why did you want her body?	For a good reason.
I'll be back later.  You just be cool, okay.	Okay.
How many times do you want to hear this?	Until I hear the truth.
What's wrong?	Nothing.
Did you hear that?	Hear what?
What are you doing in here?	Nothing.
I thought I told you to stay away from her.	Where is she?
I'm glad you decided to come after all.	Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be.
I didn't mean for you to go!	Just radio for help, okay???
I'm trying to think. When did you start looking so terrible? You look awful.	I can tell you the year, the day, the night, the minute.
Is it safe?	Do we care?
We're making too much of this.	No, we're not.
This could be it.	This could be it.
This could be it.	This could be it.
I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?	I go to college. I thought you knew.
I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?	Why do you need a radio?
And you blame me. It's because we never talk. Let's talk.	I have a class. I'm late.
What will we talk about?	Everything.
Will I believe you when you tell me something?	There's nothing left for me to lie about.
Why won't you tell me your name?	It's only our first date.
You have to tell me what you thought of the play.	First you tell me.
Life is good.	Life is good.
This could be it!	This could be it!
Life is true.	Life is real.
Who is it?	I'm at the door.
You see what you're doing, don't you?	What am I doing?
This could be it!	This could be it!
Then they lost?	Why does it matter?
Have to hurry back.	Hurry back. Hurry back to what?
Game six is history,pal.	You're not making sense.
Do you think he can do it?	I don't know.
You've come to me. I wanted to believe you would one day.	I haven't come to you.
Enough.	One more.
That was lucky.	I thought you were a man of God.
If I want to be one with them, I have to live like them.	I think you do.  But I thank God we all don't.
It's beautiful.	Even as a boy I thought so.
We need your help!	There is nothing I can give.
How much extra?	It would be five thousand more.
That's the last.	Something's not right.
What are you waiting for?	Where do we start?
It's not exactly him.	Where did you get this?
Good to see you're feeling better.	Now you're here.  Who are your "friends"?
You really need that much?	More than that.  You'll get used to it.
I gotta stop!!  I gotta stop!!	Keep going!!  Keep going!!
Where are we going?	I'm sorry.  I've got plans.
Where are you taking her?	Michael's.
Hello?	How would you like to be yourself for the day?
Why have you done this?	In case you get back before I do.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean anything.	We were just looking.
Have they found our friend?	Friend?
Of course I think about it every day.	Of course.
So you didn't do it after all.	I guess somebody beat me to it.
What is this place?	You've never been here?  Let me order for you.
What about the car?	Let's walk.
I can't.	Come on.
If everything goes to plan, this could be the last time I see you for a while.  One week to go.  Please tell me you're the least bit excited.	I'll tell you at the end of the week.
I've got enough here.	Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes.
What are you doing?	I can't do this.
The doctor will give you something.	I'm not doing it.
We'll try again.	No way. I've got to get out now.
Hello, Doc.	Hi.
Feel good?	Yeah.
It doesn't look like that.	What do you mean? You've never been there.
You go out much?	After four years and now the question comes up.
I'll be okay.	Listen, I'm just as nervous as you are.
I was going to fix you breakfast.	You were asleep.
Yeah, well, I think I'll stick with what I've got.	Suit yourself.
Promise you won't laugh.	If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
Why didn't you tell me?	There wasn't any way to explain it.
How long ago.	Fifteen minutes.
When we had trouble before it was different.	You don't like the way things are, I don't like the way things
That would be the first time.	When are you going to learn?
Only one car.	Let's do it.
How much?	Twenty eight hundred.
Are you hungry?	Not now.
Do what I tell you, it's not a game.	It's all a game, don't bother me.
We better stick here till tonight.	Yeah.
I want to say something.	I don't want to hear it.
Sounds good.	You want to try with me?
Okay.	You and me.
We've got some food coming, should be here any minute.	Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
Come on, come on.	Who was it?
You okay?	Where do we go from here?
How long before this car's hot?	Pull over.
What now?	We walk.
Hope you get to where you're going.	Thanks. Hope you do too.
Just in case someone gets a shot off.	I worked ten years without one, I don't need one now.
Drive.	Suit yourself.
How was that?	Just fine.
I guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you?	I kinda doubt it.
I don't think you have to worry much about Harold. He won't do anything.	That right?
I've got to stop.	I'll tell you when.
You knew what I'd do.	Yes, but listen. Christ, I didn't kill him.
What do you want?	What happened to this car?
I made a mistake.	What?
Jack?	Good evening.
Train goes at four minutes past twelve. You've just got time.	That's very kind of somebody. Who do I have to thank?  What happens if I miss the train?
Who paid you to see me off?	I can't Jack. How can I?
Really.	I must go. I'm in a hurry.
How were things between you and Frank?	He was all right to me.
I know him too.	Who?
Yes. I met him last year.	Go on.
We went about together.	Really?
We weren't sure where it was taking place, like.	Nice of you to come.
Sorry about your father.	Yeah.
How's school?	I left last year.
You all right now?	Yeah.
Where you going to live, then?	At me friend's house.
Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't suppose I'll see you again.  There. Go and get your hair done.	Thanks.
I mean, what for?	That's what I was wondering.
See you later.	Where you off to?
What happened to you, then?	How'd you find me?
I won't be using the room tonight.	I see.
Ta.	I'll bet this one's seen some action.
What is it?	My brother, Frank.
And what you going to do?	Make us a nice cup of tea and I'll tell you. I might even let you watch.
What'll they do to him?	Don't ask me.
Did you sleep well?	Yes, thank you.
Are you tired?	No. Are you tired?
You coming back?	How could I stay away?
Jack! I didn't like that.	You should have told me who you were working for.
Not going, Jack?	I have to. Things to see to.
Put it away, Jack. You know you won't use it.	The gun he means.
What's that? A hundred?	That's right, Harry.
Four hundred?	That's right.
How about that, Jack?  Old Harry thought I was having him on.	Shut up.
It's not.	No.
You didn't?	No.  Not actually.
Because, because, you know, it's a crime.	That's right.  It's a crime.  It is a crime.  It's also very safe.
Yes.	What will he pay?
Oh, yes, George.	What does that mean?
Fine.	Uh-huh.
I can't close 'em.	Well, they're old.  I saw the shit that they were giving you.
It is dead.	It's a waste of time.
He said we're all going to have to go talk to the guy.	What?
Who used to say that?	In school.
What?	That they're going to be upset.
Of what?	And what if you don't close.
Alright.	And fifty bucks a lead.
Wait.  Alright.  Fine.  The one.  Give me the lead.  Give me the one lead.  The best one you have.	I can't split them.
Why?	Because I say so.
What happened?	Somebody broke in.
You are?	Yes, I am.
How do you know I made it up?	What?
It was his idea.	Was it?
Don't.	I'm sorry.
When?	Last night, this morning.
Just now.	Guess who?
You're sure?	Go ahead.
I don't know.  They said we have three days.  They said we have three days.	Three days.
What's going on here?	Tell me again.  Your wife.
No, no.  That's just something she "said." We don't have to do that.	She told me I have to.
The deal.	The "deal," forget the deal. Forget the deal, you've got something on your mind, Jim, what is it?
What are the police doing?	It's nothing.
Guess what the Machine did?	Fuck the Machine.
Fuck you.	Guess who?
Three?  I count two.	Three.
Are you alright?	Yes.
Did you see my present for you?	No, where is it?
Your friend lives in a fine building.	Oh yes, the very best.
I want to talk to you, Michael.	The children can stay.
Would you like some?	No, Dad.
Hey Mike, what can I say?	Forget it, just go take care of her.
I don't have a lot to say, Michael.	We have time.
I bet you can't guess what happened?	What?
If you told Michael what I've told you today, I'm a dead man.	When is it finally over?  I want it to be over before my baby is born.
He doesn't want my help any more. He doesn't need it.	We don't know that's true, he never said that.
Hello?	She's gone, Tom.
You're going to talk to him now.	Yes.
Me too, Tom?	Yeah, give me a minute.
Did the boy get something from me for Christmas?	I took care of it.
It might show.	Mike wants it.
What's up?	No questions.
How's the baby?	Sleeping inside me.
I know.	When do we talk?
We'll try.	It's important.
On the phone?	No, she's here.
So what did you think?	Weird.
Thanks.  Why do you do it?	What do I do?
What have you done with him?	I put him to bed.  He's not there?
I didn't do it.  This wasn't me.	Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
You must leave.  You were not here this morning.	But I didn't do this!
Do you mind?	Go ahead.
Is this David's doing?	This David's a friend?
Did you kill anyone?	I don't like to talk about that.
So we understand each other?	What you do is no business of mine. Live and let live, I say.
Oh dear.  I have made you nervous.	I'm fine.  I'd just rather keep it on.
Is that why you and your friend split up?  Because you wanted to be free?	In a way, yes.  I suppose so.  I know it's why I stopped making pictures.
I suppose you'd like the top down.	If that's okay?
What did I tell you?  Listen.	I don't hear anything.
Who's that?	David.  The friend I thought was in New York.
Oh fuck.  And we left the top down. You want to run for it?	Run for what?
It's not like her.	Just a night out.  Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
Do you mind?	Not at all.
So it is going to happen after all.	What'd you say?
No.  It won't do.	What won't do?
All right.  Let's take it off now.	What was that?
Can't say that I have.  Can't say I've heard of a lot of people though.	If you don't believe me, let's watch this movie.  See if his name's on it.  How about it, Harry? Can I watch my damn movie?
Where's Betty?	She took the night off.  Heavy date.  Some guy she's had her eye on for a while.
What are you doing here?	Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
How are you feeling, Mr. Jimmy? How is your mind today?	My mind's lovely.  And yours?
That is my daughter.  She say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon.  I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy.  I will make it short.	I'll be out this afternoon, remember?  Your family can visit as long as they like.
Can that count as one question?	Of course.
Who was the job for?	Who do you think?
I know you.	You know my back.
I know you.	You know my back.
I know you.	You know my back.
How you know that?	Remember who my brother is?
Have you seen him?	No.
It's good to see ya, man. You changed your look -	You, too
Cool. So you're living up North?	Yeah -
So what are you gonna do?	About what?
What happened to you?	What?
You know what you got here?	Not really -
Tell him. It's okay.	What?
Go inside. I'll be right there.	What are you gonna do?
My bag. My bag.	What bag?
I'm gonna need some money.	How much?
I don't care. Something's going on.	That again.
Henry.  Wake up.	What's the matter with you?  You're crazy.
You son of a bitch. She's been here.	What are you talking about?
Stop! Stop!	Let her carry this shit inside.
For Christmas. Your share.  It's just a taste.	Jimmy.
Give'm a drink.	I gotta talk to you.
Watch this.	Come on, don't fuck around, will ya?
I want to talk to Jimmy.	He heard.
You ready?	Yeah.
You know what to do?	Yeah, yeah.
Come on, relax. He's drunk.  He's been locked up for six years.	I don't give a shit. That guy's got no right.
Tommy, don't fuck around. Put the gun away. Tommy!	No, no. It's okay.
He didn't call?	He's with his friends.
You want a partner?	Please?
Keep fuckin' with me. Watch what happens.	All right, then.
She didn't do it again did she?	Jesus Christ. Not even close.
What do we got?	I don't know yet.
Who'd you call?	No one. I didn't have the number.
How's the woman?	Gone.
What class?	Ah, history I think.
Hi.	How you doin'?
Oh, right.	This is your house, right?
I guess so.	What? No. This is my mother's house. I don't live with my mother. I just stop by, help out. I'm good like that.
Is that true?	Yeah, it is.
What's up guys?	Why don't you beat off at your house?
What'd you say about me?	Shut the fuck up.
What class did you say that was?	History.
Okay, you're in your bed, Will. Now how old are you?	Seven.
Oh, I'm sorry.	What're you doing?
If I agree to this, I walk right now?	That's right.
I can come back.	No, that's fine, Will. I was just leaving.
Will.	Hey, how you doin'?
Good to meet you.	Pleasure to meet you.
Good to see you.	Good to see you.
Not Rick? You didn't send him to Rick?	Just meet with the boy once a week.
I got it.	It's on the college.
Would you excuse us?	Tom.
Seems like it's going well.	I think so.
He married his cousin.	Who?
How about one now?	Sounds good.
Yeah, I read those.	What did you think?
Maybe you should be a patient and sit down.	Maybe you married the wrong woman.
Yeah? You got a lady now?	Yeah, I went on a date last week.
So you might be working for Uncle Sam.	I don't know.
Do you think you're alone?	What?
They're all dead.	Not to me, they're not.
You want to read it?	No.  Have you had any experience with that?
Oh, I know.	It's not your fault.
See ya.	Good luck.
Five minutes.	What?
Yeah?	It's Will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
I bet you have a great family.	You know, nothing special.
I have twelve big brothers.	Not a chance.
I want to meet them.	We'll do that.
Where have you been?	I'm sorry, I been real busy.
I couldn't wait till tomorrow.	How the hell did you do that?
I thought you said you'd show me your place.	Not tonight.
How's it goin'?	Fine.
Yes I do. Did you ever think that maybe I could help you? That maybe that's the point, that we're a team?	What, you want to come in here and save me? Is that what you want to do? Do I have a sign that says "save me" on my back?
Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' bullshit me!	You know what I want to hear? I want to hear that you don't love me. If you tell me that, then I'll leave you alone. I won't ask any questions and I won't be in your life.
Take care.	Goodbye.
Maybe the road's out.	I don't know what these cops got to do with it but I don't like it.  An' these here are our own people, all of 'em. I don't like this.
So long.	Hey, wait a minute. You got change comin'.
Want to work?	Sure, but what is this?
How about us? Is that the truth for us?	I don't know.
Been doin' a job?	Yeah.
Where you think you're going?	Thought I'd take a walk. Any law against it?
Anybody ask anything?	No'm.
How about it, Ma?	I'm ready.
Got any more, Ma?	No. That's all. You made a dollar, an' that's a dollar's worth.
Listen!  That's them! Them lights! Come on, we got to hide out!	Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
All you got to do is lay down an' watch.	Won't they come out here?
Morning.	Morning.
You do not.	Yes I do.
Marty, you haven't changed a bit!	Don't say that.
We had pictures put on, that way everybody knows who everybody was!	Wonderful.
What am I gonna do?	What do you want to do?
Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back.	Okay.
Okay. Let's catch up. You go first.	Well, there's not much to tell.
I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.	Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
Are you there?	Yes.
He was trying to kill you, right!	Yes.
You went to school with these people.	Come on.
How do you know?	I just know.
You look like you're far away. Far away and thinking about other things. I'm right about that, aren't I?	No.
I been looking at you, and I've decided that I want to share something with you.	Okay.
I told them to kill you and they didn't.	Hard to get good help these days.
Hello, Bob.	Hey, Bob.
Well?	I don't think so.
I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.	We can't do our job unless he does his job.
Looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us.	If he does our job, he's our job.
Throw that away.	This?
They're not happy, sir.	I'm not happy.
Enough?	Never enough.
This is not good.	I'll do it tomorrow.
What's it look like?	It's fine.
We had a good laugh, didn't we?	Yeah. I guess we did.
Marty! It's me. Paul.	Paul?
God it's great to see you.	You too.
It didn't work out.	That's too bad.
Why not?	So what are you doing with your life now, son?
What?	You ever just stand still for a minute?
Enjoy the day.	You too.
How long did you live here with your wife?	Five years. My son was born here.
Why didn't it work out?	She was never really happy here. She did the best she could.
Now, listen. I want you to stand on him.	What?!
Then what have we been doing? I mean what was the point?	The point was to love each other.
Why don't you go lie down?	I don't want to lie down. I've been lying down enough.
Dad'll pick you up today, all right?	Okay.
You should call your dad before it gets too late.	I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
Would you like to see that?	I don't care.
How long is this going to go on?	What?
Did you ask him to come visit?	You already did.
Honey, come on. Would you like to stay in town for dinner? Maybe see what movie's playing tonight?	Why? There's no food in the house?
Does anybody out there want something to drink?	I'll take care of it.
Grace? Is everything all right?  Can we talk?	About what?
Oh, I miss you. You look beautiful.	So do you.
David?	Who's there?
It's me.	Hi.
So, what, uh, what train are you taking?	I should be in by two.
Okay. We'll see you later then.	Yeah. Bye.
That bag's almost empty.	No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.
I should go get some of her things.	No, let me go.
You've got to stop doing that?	Doing what?
Did you get a hold of that horse guy?	Yeah.
What if she doesn't want to go?	She will if you think she should.
I have so much to tell you.	You want to take a walk with me?
I think I'm going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave. Just might be his first broken heart.	Oh, how sweet.
He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.	That's what some folks say.
I don't believe it.	You know her?
Tom?	Yeah.
Would you let me ride your horse?	Have you talked to Tom about it?
Can you drive?	Drive? I'm not old enough yet.
Just follow this. Nothing to it. I'm going to shut my eyes here for a little while. Just keep going till you run out of road.	I don't know if I can.
Sure?	Sure.
Grace, I need you to come with me.	No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
Dad! I can do it, OK?!	OK, OK.
Do you want something else, honey? We order something else?	No, I'm just not that hungry.
Honey, you all right? Did something fall?	NO!
IT WAS MY TURN!	YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.
I can't believe it's the same horse.	We still have a way to go.
What are you looking at, young man?	How long were you married?
Well, that'll happen.	Where did you learn all this stuff?
Secret Service!	Don't move!
Let's keep her.	Waste the dude.
Dead.	Dead?
I found it! I found it!	This is the end, my friend.  Thank you for calling!
Yes!	We did it!
He's not in this class.	I said give me time.
What the hell are you doing?	It's cool, I'm just looking.
What is it with you? I know we've been playing games, but, we're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help. I really need your help.	I'm sorry, I can't.
Thank you.	Okay. I'll copy it.
Ready?	Yeah.
Are you crazy? What are you doing?	I'm trying to help you.
Oh, wow, she's great.	Yeah.
You look good in a dress.	You would have looked better.
Hello?	We caught 'em.
Hello?	Hey, it's me.
We need to talk.	Okay sure. What about?
Are you two okay?	We've been better.
Is there another key?	I don't know!
How do we look?	You guys always look great.
Honey, I don't think their home.	How do you know their not?
Why shouldn't I?	How many people in the bus?
Sure it does.	I know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.
What are you doing out here alone?	Everybody's dead. I just wanna go home.
You don't believe that do you?	No.
Why don't you go make some coffee.	All right.
Call me.	Okay, bye.
Hell of a night.	Its not over yet.
Something?	He's been here.
Is that him? Is that him?	Yes.
Oh Christ. They wouldn't have given up without a fight.	They didn't know what they were fighting.
Why didn't you wait for me?	We did. Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed up.
Shit!	I have a place for that.
Look.	Look where?
Well, home sweet home. I'll see you later.	Okay. Bye.
Hello?	Why did you hang up on me?
I hate that dog. I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like.	What's this big, big news?
I'm scared.	Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?
Yes.	Come with me.
My parents won't be back till ten.	Are you sure?
I gotta go.	Will you call me tomorrow?
Ten minutes.	I'll be here.
Jesus!	You all right?
Are you coming over tonight?	Same time, same place.
I gotta go. I'll see you tonight.	See you.
Not any more.	Why are they under there?
Who is it?	Tommy, let me in!
Are you sure?	Yes.
I'm scared!	There's nothing to be scared of now. Get changed.
I'm not responsible, Sam.	Of course not.
I love that.  That's my type.	I can't believe it!
Hi.	Oh.
Yeah.	A lot of works.
Oh!	Oh, is that what it is?
It's French, though.  It really is.	Yeah.
We got that idea on that trip to Paris.	Right.
Yeah.	What time do you get off?
Yeah.	It's terrific!
Yeah.	Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
So what's the, uh, problem this time?	This time I really think I have something.
How ya doin', man?	I told him about your work, and he's very excited.
Yes.	Everything's okay? 
Oh!	What are you doing?!
I thought you weren't coming.	I almost didn't.
This is not an easy situation.	I know it isn't.
You've been very cold to me tonight.	No.
Great idea.	I know.
Hi.  How's she doing?	I am glad to see you.
Don't make it worse, Dad.	Always.
Oh, Mom!	Oh, honey!
I don't understand.  I thought that you would be happy.	How can we be happy?
Want some coffee or tea?	No, thank you.
How about something to eat?	No, nothing.
Are you sure?	Absolutely.
You know, you've been very nervous lately.	I can't take this anymore.
Oh, Christ!  What's wrong with you?!	I'm sorry.
Look at this guy.	Yeah?
Yeah.  What?	Can I tell you something?  Can I tell you a secret?
Oh, great.	You look so beautiful.
Oh, yeah?	He was, he's just as crazy as ever. He was on his way to get a blood test. 
So how are you?	Oh, me, I'm okay.
How is everything?	Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
Come on!  Hurry up!  Let's go!	Wow!
Gee.	Is there no chance?
This is the second opinion.	Well, then a third opinion.
What?  You're kidding!	No, no, we decided!
Doesn't she look great in that new dress?	Yeah.
Don't you think she does?	She really does, though.
Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why.	Look, everything's going your way.
Hey, what's the matter?	I'm real upset about what you wrote.
Can we, can we go?	No!
Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work out.	Yeah.  Me, too.
So how are you?	I'm okay.
Now don't get nervous.  It's just your husband.	Hi.
Oh, please!  We all came to have lunch, didn't we?	Yeah, okay, right.  Forget it.  What's to eat?
And?  Then?	I wonder no longer.  You were out of the country.
You should get Married.	That's what I should do.  Tell me why?
Because you're going to help me plan a party.	You're going to do that?
She must be something special After Dark.	I can't remember.  I've got to make some money.
Yes.	What does that mean?
Now what? What did I do this time?	I just wanted to know if you've seen this.
What are you doing?	Nothing.
Fuck off.	I should leave. You probably need your rest.
God, you're beautiful.	Thank you, my love.                                         ]
I'm sorry? I don't get it.	You did last night.
Goddamn. Will somebody please tell me why I smoke these damn things?	Because you're an idiot.
Anyway, I can say never to high school. I've got David.	King David.
Maybe you should see a doctor.	Yeah, maybe.
No way, no day!	Give it up girl!
What were you trying to do? Sleep?	Suicide is a private thing.
It's not perfect. I don't really like my friends.	I don't really like your friends either.
We killed them, didn't we?	Of course.
Can't you see this is a special moment?	I was just making it more special.
Is it sleeping, dude?	I think so, man.
Hello!	Well? Tell us! How'd it go?
You have it.	Oh, no. I'm watching my figure.
Look, Mother!	looks down at the ground in front of her.
I think I'm dying . . .	Don't . . . please! Please, don't!
To be known as He!	He . . .
Him.	Him . . .
This.	This . . .
That.	That . . .
What?	It's so beautiful!
You'll never guess what's happened!!	What??
I'm coming with you.	Yes . . .
Sure plenty of times.	Well?
Must be nice.	What?
Good boy.  Where's is it?	What?
Oh my God. It's coming out.	What?
Sorry I'm in your seat aren't I?	No please make yourself at home.
What do you want?!	Who the hell are you talking to?
You should give it to someone with only one leg.	One leg!  Like the Red Cross or something?
I just wanna talk with you for a minute.  Then you can jump.  You can jump twice for all I care.	Talk from there.  You can talk from there.
Here.  Get off here.	Thanks.  Thanks, pal.
She wants to quit?	She can't quit.
Hi, Chief.  You like the suicide?	Never reach out!
Hey, c'mon.	They're really white.
Things are beginning to come to a head.  I can feel it.  And I want everything to be perfect.	Who doesn't?
Oh, great.	Yeah, that was easy.
About what?	About us.
Mommy!	It's okay, baby, the police are coming.
C'mon, kids, let's go.	"We don't want to be late for our first day of school."
Where'd he go?	He's staying with a friend.  Hurry up now, you'll be late for school.
I hear what you're saying, but I know what you're thinking.	What?
Did you hear that?	What?
How was lunch?	Huh?
Do you remember who gave us this?	No.
Honey?  How did it go?  You didn't call me.	He wasn't there.
Should I come home when I'm finished there?	We'll talk in the morning.
God, your sister's really hot.	Shut up.
Shit!	Put it out, man!
Are we gonna buy this house?	Do you have enough money?
Do you see a man?	No.
I thought I was supposed to stay in my room.	Get on the other side of that.
Is it a king or a queen?	It's a double.
Promise?	Promise.
I'd like that.	Would you?
Really?	Really.
What the hell.  What is this?  A joke?	No joke, Lieutenant.
Lieutenant?	What?  Who are you?  What do you want?
You didn't see this.  Understand?	Yes.
When did you get back?	A few days ago.
Where were you last night around nine?	I already told you.  I took a walk.
She was a good woman.	You didn't bring me here to talk about her.
I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?	No.
Most people would show some sign of fear with a gun in their face.	Most people are afraid of death.
Must you do that?	What?
Life.  You've stopped living it.  You look, but you do not see.  You listen but, you do not hear.	I hear you.
The river.	That's all?
I'm leaving.	Leaving what?
What are we doing here?	Living.  Remember?
To ask her to dance.	She's the King's cousin.
You've been seeing her for over a month now.  Have you learned nothing from the past?	I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
Well?	It's done.
I cannot stay.	Why not?
Leaving?  For how long?	You'll no see me again.
Why?	I cannot explain.
Yes.  How did you know?	A lucky guess.
You're hurt.	I'll be fine.
No.	You look like you have.
Good evening.	You're twenty minutes late.
You didn't answer my question.	I know.
I'm just trying to place you.	I've lived all over the world.
Would you like to see it?	I've seen it.
Where will you go now?	It will end tonight.
He's in there!	Get out.
What now?	Now I can start to live.  To feel. To grow old and live each day without the promise of another.
We found him this morning.	What's that next to him?
Do you?  Then why don't you go out? Meet someone.  Make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?	I like my work.
You know it's not safe here for you.	I know.
You kept it?	Yes.
What are you doing?	I shouldn't have come back here.  It was a mistake.
Mike!  Mike, can you hear me?	I think he's dead!
Find out how we can hurt him.  By the end of the day, I want to own him.	It's happening right now.
There's fuckin' blood all over you!	I didn't know he would have a gun!  It just went off!
That's why we gotta keep going.  I'm not gonna go in for murder.	We're on foot.  We can't get away.
Jesus.  What is this?	Are you totally stupid?  What does it look like?
We're fucked.	We're fucked until we think of a way out; then we're rich.
It's over.  We have to give up.	Fuck it's over.  That money's mine.
Then we might as well die rich.	I'm not going to die for this!
You've been in there a long time. What're you waiting for?	Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
Who else is here?	My father.
He needs a doctor.	Shut up and sit down.  You think someone's gonna make a house call?
What about my father?	Aw, Jesus, not more of this.
What the fuck is that?	They'll cut the power.
What if it goes south?	What do you mean?
They're close.  Let me make a call.  You can see they're okay.	You said they would be here!
You get the other one when I have my girls.  Not talk to them; have them.	Where is it?
I need to work out some stuff.	You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
Can we talk some more when you get here?	We'll see you in a couple of hours.
He can't reach us in here.  We're safe.	I know.
Want one?	I don't drink beer.
Now we can do whatever we want.	Stop it.
What do you want?	Keep your voice down.  I'm taking you and your brother out of here.
What's going on?	Get in the car.  Now.
I'm not going to wake him.  I don't even know that I can.	Just one question.  Please.
That's not enough.	What's that, Chief?  Say again.
He says that his father's hurt.	If we have a man dying in there, we'll have to go in.
In a few minutes the white phone is going to ring.  So let's get our shit straight before that happens.	You used to be a cop.  All of you used to be cops.  I can tell by the way you move.
We've got to get those kids out of there!	Not until the man calls.
The kids are in here!	Where's the office?
Where are my children?	They're still in the house.
I don't know what you're talking about.	He's going to kill you.  Don't you know that?  He can't take the chance that you'll talk.
Where's your gun?	I'm the Chief.  I don't carry it.
I guess we each have something the other wants.	I guess we do.
Paul, we would like to speak to you in your office.	We, who is we?
Captain, I must take my family. It is not safe here.	Where is your family?
Please, I don't use guns.	There is nothing to it.
Ten.	And four children?
Where are they going?	They can go where they want. They are in charge now.
We are better here.	Listen, you need me.
You lie.	If you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
Time is money, George. We need extra beer today.	Business is good at the hotel?
Let's go.	Take the river road back. It is clear.
Holy shit! Holy shit.	What is it?
You fucking see that!	Oh my God!
Get out of this room and get back to work.	I don't have to listen to you anymore.
Are you sure this is the river road?	I saw the sign.
Give her what she wants, room, food, anything. Charge it all. Don't you put her out, Paul.	I would never do that.
Who did you call?	Call, sir?
Excuse me.	What?
I'm afraid you will have to move room.	Move? Where to?
They should go one truck at a time. When the first truck gets through to the airport, then the others will follow.	We can't wait. We all go together or not at all.
Do something.	What?
No.	We must do something.
Oh, my God!	Where are you hurt, son?
What is it, Paul.	Stay with the children.
Paul, don't let them die.	Get in.
Them. They almost got us all killed. I have done enough for them! We cannot look after them anymore.	What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.
This won't do.	It will do just fine.
Any luck?	No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.
My sister is dead, Paul. They would not leave the children.	No. They are not dead. Stop this.
I have to go out to get food.	Go out! Where?
I hear we must pay for everything. How much for this?	A kiss.
I have to stay.	No! Sit down now.
Let me go. Children get off.	I will follow on the next plane. Go.
I love you. Keep the children safe.	Paul! Then another voice.
We are almost out of water.	We are almost out of everything.
We have to have a plan.	What sort of plan?
Twelve are dead.	How dead?
What is this about no water?	It's true, sir, the water has been turned off.
Out? Where are you going?	I do not know, sir. I think they will kill us all.
Paul, are you there?	Yes, thank you Mr. President.
Don't think it'll be a problem.	C'mon.
There must be some other way out.	Well, until that's found, I think it's a good idea we all stick together.  Or wouldn't that fit into your plans, baby?
What?	Is she alright?
Where is it??	I don't know!!
Yeah, what the hell, I'll go.	Yeah, me too.
What's in there?	Nothing.
If you know where it is, get there!	Me? You've gotta be kidding.
I'll meet you down there.	Take the gun.
Thanks.	Most fun I've had all day.
I think we should have taken a right back there.	Back where?
This is the best we're gonna do.	It'll have to do.
Price!!	He's gotta still be down here.
Where did it go?	Run.
What?	Jesus!
So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that?	I hope not.
Business or pleasure, Mr. Price?	My wife. Where were we?
Do something!	Like what?? This isn't supposed to be happening!!
What is it??	Something with the power, I don't know!!
Oh, no.	What's going on?
Don't know that it does.	Well, then, how 'bout maybe we call someone?
Won't do any good.	Why not?
Price!	Oh, dear.
Damn it.	What's the matter?
Town records are coming up now.	What will they tell you?
Did you find her?!	No!
Don't play games with me, little girl.	I didn't do anything, mommy.
It's going to hurt us!	No it won't - no it won't!
Are we leaving mommy?	Yes, we'll be leaving soon.
Oh my God, what happened to you? My baby -	I'm ok mommy.
Help me!  Please!!!	My God, I heard something!
Can I have this room daddy?	Sure.  Did you see the others?
Look daddy!  It's empty!	That's great, honey.
Mommy please help me!	Don't be afraid!
Oh my God!  She's in there!	Daddy help!
It's just going to take a while.	Whatever you say.
To our family.	To our family.
I wish I knew more about her.	Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
What the hell is that?	I don't know.  That's strange.
But do you agree with me?	Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
How are we doing?	I think everything's ready.
Oh my God where is she!	She's gone!
You don't think I know?	Know what?
Do you think I'm a fool?	What?
Are you all right?	I'm ok.
Where is your daughter?  She might be able to give us some information.	She's at school.  We've tried not to upset her more than she's been.
Thank you.  I believe she would have wanted it.	Did you know her very well?
Your daughter's been taken.	What!
I'm going to need some blood.  It must be from a woman.	Why?
She's coming back.  Keep talking!	Come back to us honey!
Did you have dinner, father?  We have plenty.	Well thank you for the offer,  But I really have to go.
Well there's no time like the present.  Good night.	Good night.
Take care of the girl.  Take care of your family.  They are important.	Yes, they are.
There's something in there.	What?
Not on station time.	No.  Not on station time.  My story.  My time.
Something bad.	And why are you back?  Why are we here?
Hold on.  Hold on, please.  I need talk to you.	It's nothing to do with me.  I wasn't even with him.
Look, lady!  I told you!  It's not my problem!  I was just there!	Where?
What?	Your dream.  You said you were having a bad dream.
Great.  Thanks.  You gonna have one?	I'm trying to quit.
Jesus.  Are you sure this is the street?	Yeah.  Happening, isn't it?
Never mind.  I'm glad it's gone.  Made the store feel strange.  Who'd make such a thing?	Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
Yes really.	Wow.  Thank you.
It doesn't bother me.  I'm just not interested.	Oh.  Like I'm not an interesting person.
Yeah right.  How'd you get this number?	Will you relax?  Your little girlfriend left a card, remember?
I don't think so.  Not yet.  I'm not ready yet.	Sure.  Sure.  I understand.  It's cool. I mean, we've got all night.
Count of three?	Why not just go now?
No, let me!	I don't care.
Not that way! Through the door!	But, sir!
She isn't!	She is!
I think you need some help.	I'm afraid so.
You're single?	Yes.
Where do you think you're going?	It's my day off.
Can't I take it for you?	No, thank you.  Tomorrow's time enough for you to begin work.
I heard you playing.	I often do.
I wanted to help you.	Help me? How?
Good night.	Good night.
I'm, uh, going to bed.	So early?
Ready to go?	We're not going anywhere.
Hi dad.	Hey guy. Things ok up there? You all right?
See you.	Stay out of trouble.
What the hell are you kids doing down here?	What do you think we're doing, dad?
Talking to me, dad?	Who else would I be talking to? And take that thing off!
He's probably been waiting all night at the station.	C'mon.
You okay?	Yeah. You?
I don't like coffee.	It'll warm you up.
Please don't.	It's not a bother.
Oh.	It's really quite all right.
No more man. I'm about to drop as it is.	See ya.
How can you do that man?	Do what?
Hey.  I'll take this stuff.	You going to tell dad?
Maybe you should have just a half.	Thanks for the advice dad.
Where you going?	Out.
I don't ever want to see you.	Then why'd you come after me?
You're parents at that party?	Yeah. Yours?
It feels warm.	One more shot?
I love you.	That's nice. Are you drunk?
Yes, sir.	That's all, for now.
Will, you can't blame yourself.	I had him!
This murder was in the papers, right?	Yeah.  All over.
What are you doing here?	I told her to come.
I'll call him now.	First I need a copy of the key.
Good.	And something else that might interest you.
She wasn't happy.  I was someone to talk to.	How do you mean?
Eight years.	Seven years.
What do you want to talk about?	You know what about.
Well her mother didn't buy them for her.	What are we thinking?
Your friend's all business.	I'm always all business.
Did you love her?	Huh?
I don't know.	You don't know.
I was her best friend.	Best friend?
You want me to take you somewhere?	Long as it's fun.
I don't know.	You don't know.
It was like some big fucking secret!	What was?
I'm sorry?	I said you're going to get a phone call.
Down at the station?	Yes down at the station.
No.	But you wanted to.
I thought maybe we could talk some more.	There's nothing more to talk about.
Yes.  Like that.	This an accident, Walter?
You didn't even warm them, did you?	No.
Why always on this night?	What night? What do you mean?
Which of you did it? Which of you made me the way I am?	What you are? You would be something other than you are?
You made us what we are, didn't you?	Stop her Louis!
Why yours alone? Tell me how it was done!!!!	Be glad I made you what you are! You'd be dead not if I hadn't.
I want more.	What have you done?
You see the old woman? That will never happen to you. You'll never grow old. You will never die.	And it means something else too, doesn't it? I shall never, ever grow up.
But now's the time to end it, Louis. Now's the time to leave him.	He'll never let us go.
Louis, look at me.	I can't. Go away from me.
How do I look?	Still my beautiful child.
You want me to be your daughter forever, don't you?	Yes.
They would have killed you -	Then my luck would have changed.
Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?	And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?
You're not afraid of anything, are you?	Why should I be?
You have to ask me for this. You have to want it, do you hear me?	Give it to me!!!
Let's call that a start.	I can't do it.
You really want to be with them?	Yes. Kill me. Kill me like you promised -
You're body's dying. Pay no attention. It will take twenty minutes at most.	Dying?
Come, you're going to feed now.	I want a woman.
You must get into it. It's the only safe place for you when the light comes.	And if I don't?
Have you ever been caught?	Of course not. It's so easy you almost feel sorry for them.
You were going to kill me? Drink my blood?	Yes but you needn't worry about that now. Things change.
Shall we go on?	He did it to make you stay with him!
But why did you tell her?	How could I not? She had to know.
Listen to me. He's here.	Who? Who is here?
You'll go away with you're college friends, but you won't go away with me?	Idiot. Idiot. Idiot.
There's nothing between Will and me.	Yet. Nothing yet.
Say yes.	No.
I'm the King of the World.	No, I'm the King of the World.
No way.	Yes.
You get any sleep at all?	Some.
Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed him. Now, get over it. We gotta think here.	They never found the body.
There's no way to lock it.	What do we do?
I'm holding your hand!	No, you're not.
I understand something.	It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be.  It just isn't.
I love it here.	It's gonna be great.
We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one.	Who?
This was not my idea.	What?
What? What are you talking about? Where?	It's in my room!
Come on. We're gonna be okay.	Did you get help?
Why are you doing this to me?	Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
If you can say all you gotta say in a minute then I don't wanna hear it.	I'll talk real slow.
Worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me.	Come on, I'll take a break and we'll all dance.
Is there a problem here?	Where there's a Will, there's a way. Come on.
Pretty cool bar.	They all start to look the same once you've worked in one.  Am I right, sister?
You sure you didn't pick up my hair tie?	Hello?
I'll come with you.	Are you crazy? We're not staying here on our own.
Why? He can't help us.	He's probably the only one who can help us.
You guys lost?	Tell me this ain't the bar scene.
What's the matter, boy trouble?	Not anymore.
Take this.	And do what with it?
Goodbye.	May life be good to you both. As for the others  they will be quiet here  and I will be with them.
What are you doing?	I was looking for you.
There is something evil about her.	Oh, now  now look here 
It makes me fear her.	I can't understand that.
Until we know, what choice is there? We have to stay.	But the war, the army  they need you.
Come on, we got to get this up. He's coming.	Who?
You what? To save me?	Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go through with it, did you?
What'd you say?	I said I wish I'd never been born.
You have no car.	Well, I had a car, and it was right here. I guess somebody moved it.
What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before.	You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
I . . .	If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
She's . . .	Where is she?
Poor George . . . Sit down.	Sit down? What are . . .
What did you stop it for?	I want you to take a good look at that face.
Is this the place?	Of course it's the place.
Well?	Mother . . .
Well, sure I do.	When'd you see him last?
Hi, Daddy.	Well, what happened to you?
What?	Will you try to get some sleep?
So long, George. See you in the funny papers.	Goodbye, Sam.
Goodbye, everybody!	All in . . .
Oh, no  you don't feel so good.	I'm all right.
George! George!	Yes, sir.
Is it a charge, sir?	Yes  charge.
Hope you have a good trip, George. Uncle Billy and I are going to miss you.	I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.
Yes . . . Yes . . . You're right, son.	You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
Mary . . . Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.	Come on, George, let's hurry.
Oh, am I glad to see you.	Say, where's Mother?
Hello, George, how are you?	Harry . . . Harry . . .
What gives?	Nothing.
George, can I see you for a second?	Why, of course you can. Come on in the office here.
No, George, don't . . .	Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
Say hello to New York for me.	Yeah  yeah . . . sure I will.
Hello.	How do you do.
Well, what do you know  wife.	Well, how do you do. Congratulations. Congratulations. What am I doing?
Pop!	They're not my children.
Well, hello.	Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.
I'm not very good at this.	Neither am I.
Oh, no.	Come on, tell me.
My mother just called you? Well, how did she know?	Didn't you tell her?
Well, are you coming in or aren't you?	Well, I'll come in for a minute, but I didn't tell anybody I was coming over here.
All right, for a minute. I still can't understand it though. You know I didn't tell anybody I was coming here.	Would you rather leave?
Oh . . . yeah, yeah. That's all right.	Don't you like her?
George . . . George . . . George . . .	Mary . . .
Hi.	Hi.
Mary! Mary!	George, darling! Where have you been?
Oh, George, George, George.	Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!
I guess you forgot something.	Huh?
I can't wait to get there.	But of course.
Maybe by now they are.	They're moving pretty fast.
Over here.  I want you to meet somebody.	Lucky.  Lucky, lucky, lucky.
Hey!	Over here!
On your own time?	Happy to do it.
Chief?	In here.
I can't let you take her out.	You can't stop me.
Where to?	No place special.  Just hanging out.
You stay here a minute.	Oh, c'mon.
Michael.	Yeah?
Mike?  Is that you?	Pop.  I'm sorry.
Look at that:	First things first.
Where the hell were you?	Late.
Do I have to talk to those two?	My boss and your boss.  Sure.
Let's get the kid home.	Home it is.
Need a ride?	As far as the office.
Hey!  That's my boss!	Better yet.
You have to smoke so early in the morning?	It's good with coffee.
Thank you.  I'll tell him.	For me?
All summer?	He wanted a job, he's got one.  I want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.
I know what you're going to say.	Do you?
What?	What'd I say?
What're you doing?	Going out.
What is it?  What's the matter?	Mike's out there.
Mom, Michael won't talk to me.	Shouldn't he be at home?
Some people.	What's daddy doing?
Hang on!	Dad!  Dad!
Is that me?	That's you.
I told you, remember?	Oh, yeah.  So why aren't they doing it now?
We're going to die.	It's all right, we're okay.
My cousin will be here tomorrow.	Great.
You're not going out right away, are you?	Waiting for Andy.
Mike!  Are you going out?	Maybe.
Get a dance yet?	Nope.
Take a break for a minute, okay?	Huh?
Come on back up here!	Nope.
What about the others?	They'll be there when we get there. Might even have a fire started.
Right after, the Kids went out?	What Kids?  Who went out?
Rich or poor, it's nice to have money.	Figure they split?
How much longer?	Until we find something.
About damn time.	What the hell is it?
What is it?	Power line.
I don't care.	I love it.
I don't think she's such hot stuff.	When are we going out?  You and me?
I don't need you.  Andy's here.	You always go with Andy.
Do I have to play with the little kids?	Yeah.  Go on, beat it.
You're going out.	Yeah.
Yeah.	Would you take him?
Thank you.	Want another one?
Damn it!	Hi, baby.
What's wrong?	Nothing.
Where are you going?	Up.
You're going down there again?	Yes.
Change your mind?	No.
Finally.	How's your patient?
They said you'd be here.	What's up?
That's right.	Who's going to do it?
Are you okay?	I'm  fine.
I will.	Well, then I'm going to film it.
How's sleeping beauty?	Still sleeping.
I think they'll come out now.	They still seem nervous.
He's a young one.	And big for his age.
When did this happen?	Ten minutes ago.
I knew it;  it's my fault.  We moved it too soon.	Don't blame yourself.
Give me a ride?	Sure.
I haven't seen that much, but so far it looks great.	Well, wait till you see the rest.
You were great out there!	Did you see me?!  Wasn't I terrific?
Besides that.	I don't know, what else is there?
Isn't this fun!	Can hardly wait to do it again.
Told you you'd like it.	Now what's this do?
Did you see that?	What?
I'll go with you.	No way.
Let us know as soon as you have anything.	Right, Mike.
Come on, let's go.	Something wrong?
Okay, you two, have a good life without me.  I gotta go.	Don't hurry back.
She still talking to you?	We're in love.
Yes!	You can stay in my room.
How are you doing?	Okay.
You hungry?	No.
Hurry!	Just like that?
What happened?	Nothing!  What the hell are you doing down there?
What's so funny about that?	You think he's not good enough for her?  You're right.  If she was my mother, I'd send her home right now.
Did you like that, Mama?	Yes.
What do you think?	I think you're here all day.
You want my advice?	Maybe?
Maybe not? I'm feeling lucky ..	So am I. But where's my money?
What do you want it for?	To throw out of the window.
That isn't what you said before.	I was wrong.
Did he shut you down?	All but .. How you doing?
Did I say he did?	You looked like you did?
Well .. I didn't know that ..	No .. You didn't know that ..
Where's your watch?	I guess by the bed.
Alright. I'll start at the top, and work down.	You ain't going in alone?
Can I see your hands?	My hands?
Are you married?	Was. But I don't like to talk about it.
Why can't I stay with you?	It's not possible right now.
I think they're gonna arrest me.	I don't want them to arrest you.
You can drive down there, Sir ..	I'm already walking. Where is it?
Listen to me!	No.
Didn't hear it.	There is something missing here.
Oh Jerry.	You know I didn't ever want to hurt you.
Let me think about that.  Want something to drink?	I see what you're saying.
Well, thanks.	Well, take care.
Oh no.	No no. I knew.
It's all going to work.  We're going to save the world.	Well, I'm happy for you.
Hey you.	Hi.
Too bad.	Better now than later.  We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.
Beer okay?	Yeah, thanks.
Truth?	Sure.
Well, good evening.	Good evening.
Why do you love me?	Why do you love me?
Wait. Where is he?	He's in the living room asleep.
That's the girl I love.	But you just gotta hear me out on one thing.  You're very responsible with Ray and you know it's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house.
I got it.	Now doesn't that just make you feel good to say it?  Say it with me.
Show.  Me.  The.  Money.	Congratulations.  You're still my agent.
You love me now, don't you?	Very much.
Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance.	Fine.
What's wrong.	Forget it.  Forget it.
You never had The Talk, did you?	No.
Not everyone has what you have.	Then why'd you get married?  I'm asking you as a friend.
I don't want to be friends anymore.	Fine.
Thanks for coming.	I missed ya.  What can I say?
Pardon me?	Came here to fire you, Jerry.
Hi.	Hi Ray.
I don't see any.	Funny.
Do you think it goes all the way across?	One way to find out.
Oh, my God.	What is it?
Sorry.	Nothing you haven't seen before.
You look good.	So do you.
It's not safe.	We have to help him.
I don't know. I don't have it with me.	When did you have it last?
Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?	I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!
My own kid was right in front of me and I didn't do a damn thing.	You couldn't have made that jump.
You had the phone the whole time?	Where is it?
PAUL!	DAD!
Where's Dad?	Just hold on.
We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.	I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
Absolutely not.	They're here.
I CAN GET HIM!	NO!
So, Mark's working at the State Department now.	Really?  What do you do there?
You remember the sounds they made?	I try not to.
We're safe!	No we're not.
We needed somebody who knew the lay of the land. Somebody who'd been to this island before.	I have never been on this island!
Well that's good.	But you never came across just one.
Billy!	It's no use, Dr. Grant. No use.
You hear something?	No.  I feel something.
Are you all right?!  Anything broken?	I'm fine, I'm fine, I was scared, I thought you, are you okay?!
Dad!	Come on!
Had to.  To keep him still for the trip.	You've broken its leg!
We took to the rock.	Why?
If I don't move, I can't shoot it.	Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.
Their what?	Oh, God.
What?	Don't ask me.  The guy's completely out to lunch.
You know how to work a radio, don't you?	You're going too?
No way.	Oh, my God.
Then this is our chance.	Our chance to do what?
?!	It has a broken leg!
What do they want?!	What do you think they want?!
No.	No way.
We can't stay in here!	We're sure as hell not going back out there"
Oh, God.	What?!
Hold it down, Nick!	I'm trying!
We have to send someone to look for him!	You go if you like, but we're not waiting for you.  MOVE IT OUT!!
Ask her.	Can the kid walk?
No, no, no, that's crazy, you're out of your mind, he's absolutely out of his mind - -	Wait a minute.  What exactly does this mean?
How long will this take?	'Bout thirty seconds.
There you are.  Out you come.	Oh my God.
But you know, I should  really be the one going .	Why?
Why would they care what we think?	What kind of park is it?
So what are you thinking?	We're out of a job.
Are you sure?	I'll just finish.  Yeah, I want to finish.
Do you see anything?	I don't know.
I'm going with you.	Okay.
No. We can't.	Why not?
It's all right.	Like hell it is!
That's right.  Will break through.	I get ah - -
Can we chance moving him?	Please - - chance it.
Yes?	- - shut up.
I can't see.	What are we looking for?
Hey!  Where did you find those things?	In a box under my seat.
I read your book.	Oh, yeah - - great.
Go, go, go, jump!	You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
You got any kids?	Me?  Oh, hell yes.  Three.  I love 'em.  I love kids.  Anything at all can and does happen.
Where does he think he's going?	When you gotta go, you gotta go.
Oh my God!	We gotta do something.
Can't you stop these things?!	Sorry!  It's kind of a ride!
Ah - - they're here.	Who?
It's safe?	It's safe.
Well?	There's no sign of him anywhere.
I don't know, I don't know.  I'm sorry - -	Why did you do this?
That's not funny.	That was great!
Hello?	Who is this? What's going on?
It's still on.	What?
Well?	He's fucking nuts.
I think I'm onto something, Joe.	Me too. I'm drunk.
See this?	Yeah, what is it?
Where do you live?	Up there.
Hello again.	I've never seen you here before.
Are you free tonight?	Tonight?
Maybe it's true then what she said.	What did she say?
Jack!	We're leaving.
Jesus Christ ! How could you do this to him? How could you do this?	Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving!
Did you fear for your life?	Yeah.
Are you gonna start it up?	Yeah.
Oh no.	Like for you to look for the man.
I'm not going to hurt you, absolutely, I'm not.	Will you let me go then?
Well do you think it was him?	What do you think?
I thought you were going back to the apartment.	You said you wanted these.
You asked if there was anything more you could help me with.	When?
The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time.	Why?
Please.	We did this before.
Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.	Don't touch anything.
Oh look what he did in them.	Drop it.
Listen to me: It's all right. I've been expecting something.	My God, I thought it was over. And here I am, daddy, right back at the start.
Would you like to know what's in it? The report.	What's in it?
That's how the other one died, you know. In the water.	I looked it up.
Well?	Yeah.
Where is the child?	He's in his room, playing.
On earth.	On earth.
When is mommy coming back?	Soon.  Very soon.
When is mommy coming back?	Soon.  I told you before, very soon.
Daddy?	Yeah?
Daddy?	Uh huh?
Is mom ever coming back?	You mean for good?
Now go to sleep.  It's very late.	Good night.
See.  That's my name.	It's my name too.
Wow!	You like it?
Did mommy ever see this?	No, she never did.
Were you?	Yes.
Hello, Ted.  You look well.	So do you.
How's the new job?	Fine.
I've seen him.	You have?
Wow!	I mean it Ted, you're running this one.
Yes.	Yes, what?
And?	I'm going to take it.
You heard anything yet?	Any day.
Mama, my story.	Again?
Not the way to talk to people.	Can I do anything I want?
Yes.	Time to study.
Oh, no. Where will he go?	Far, far away.
I will be back in a few days.	How many?
This many?	Yes, yes. Your brothers are here.
Who am I?	We do not know.
Will we be in this war?	No. This war is almost over.
I need to know what you know. I am no longer a child.	Ask whatever you will.
Good day.	Good day.
Did you love your husband, before you married?	I did not know him before I married him. I loved his brother, but then, I married his brother, too. He is dead now.
No.	Too young?
You killed him.	Oh, yes.
You're a beautiful woman.	Thank you.
Please.  I'll have sex with you, anything, but get out of the water.	He's not gonna hurt me.
Go!!!	I'm trying!!!
Jesus Christ!!	What the hell are you doing?!!
Maybe he doesn't play well with others.	Is everything a big fucking joke to you?
I can arrest you!!	Then do it!!
No!	I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
Where is he?!	I don't know!
And again.  How would you get him on land?	That's actually the easy part.
If he's here, I'll find him.  Did she tell you we had sex together?	I never had sex with you!
Did you want to be killed by it?	You think I'm that nuts?
Didn't even sound good?	No.
I'm okay.	You're not okay, your leg's a mess.
You're gonna be okay.	Guess I finally got bit.
He's gonna live?	Yeah.  Thanks to you.
Why are you here?  Really.	I told you.
Oh my God.	What?
Same thing from Fish And Game.	Something's in that water.
He could be right there and you wouldn't see him.	I'd be able to see something.
Okay.  We're up at six.	Good.
Like little children.  You okay?	Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
Sorry.	It's okay.
Well.  Goodnight.	We seem to say goodnight a lot.
Okay.  Okay.  Okay.	That is it!!
What?	Look.
I'm ready when you are.	Let's go.
You said nobody came in here!	Obviously I was wrong!
He's done.  He's dying.	Don't count on it.  We better take him out.
Thanks for your help.	You too.
I wouldn't.	I'm fine, thank you.
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.	Look.
What is she doing now?  Mother of God.	What?
They're coming right in.	Such a simple idea and it's working.  What does that tell you?
Should I?	Wait.
Hi.  Listen.  Could I steal you a second?	Absolutely.
I had a great time last night. Again.	Me too.
What'd I do?	Stay cool. Just remember to call him "God."
No. He won't come after me.	Why not?
Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?	I think so.
Are you alright?	Can we rest soon?
Will you consider that?	Yes. Yes, I will.
Where do we go from here?	We don't.
Be careful with it.	Don't worry, I don't want to give up any more.
Doc eat already?	The good doctor hasn't showed yet.
That's why there's a dead one on the ship.  It ran out of blood.	What dead one on the ship?
I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?!	No.
Go on!	No!
It hit me!  Where are they?!	I can't see them!
No!	It bit me!
I'm going inside.	What's your air reading?
Made your million, yet?	Not yet.
Getting some food.	Under there?
What is it?	The air's stopped.
Don't spend all day down there.	Don't fuckin' worry, I ain't.
Are you sure you saw something?	How many times I got to tell you.  I saw a ship.
What's wrong, did you miss me?	Hardly.
I'll kill him!	Stop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?
I wanted to talk to you about that.	Well, talk.
Yes?	It's happening tomorrow morning. Get back here now.
Well?	Well what?
There are no others.	Now, stop fucking around. The others, the old ones?
What are you doing?	Well, it's a five minute walk or a thirty second drive.
How long has he been in there, son?	About twenty minutes.
It's not him, Dad.	Try that one.
Yeah?	That's no way to answer the phone.
It must be this one.	Just give me the keys.
My neck, Dog.  That's the last bag?	How about you? All right?
Where?	Out the back.
That's it all done, we are off.	You think it's a good idea taking it back to yours?
You what? What are you on about?	Listen, if he has the guns he might have the money . . . I think we should go and see him.
There's nothing in it!	What do you mean?
What the hell are you doing here?	Why, what's up?
Well, what did he say?	He said he thinks we have paid him, and he wants to talk about those guns . . . now.
You and me, Tom.	What do you mean, me?
Tom, this is our case.	. . . What?
You got it all?	A hundred grand.
I will.	You will what?
I'll see ya.	For half a million?
That you, boy?	It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
Go on.	I like your bar.
How much did you say it was, Tom?	You know how much it is, Nick.
Look. Go on, look.	At what, exactly?
What you telling us for? The only thing I care about is whether you get your rest in.	Tom, you're all heart.
What's left over?'	Hold on, give us half a chance to count it.
I don't know what the big deal is.	You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam.
It's my life. If I want to fuck it up, that's my business.	I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age.
Well?	You really want to know, sir?
How do you think I got to be a colonel?	Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. Do whatever they tell you.
Why don't you start with that?	Yes, sir.
Did you know he was going to be there last night?	If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
Sam the Man.	Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.
Whole different story; isn't it?	You're fired. You're outta the department.
You weren't in here tonight, were you?	No sir.
Are we going to ever see your father?	My father.
This place is a gold mine.	Lead mine.
What?	It's a lead mine.
That where he was shot?	That's where he fell.
I gonna meet that family of yours?	Why would you want to do that?
There must have been somebody.	I was too busy.
Not if you have half a brain in your head.	Of course you can.
Mom?	Yeah?
He's all yours.	Are you okay?
Your mother still doesn't like me.	I can't name anybody she does like these days.
We thought we were something, didn't we?	Yeah.
Wow.	Yeah.
How long have you lived here?	Two years.
You're out early.	Yeah.
Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that.	What's up?
You going to tell her?	You going to tell him?
Right.	That's so cool.
You did.  Didn't you?	Why would I do that?
I don't want him getting in the way.	He won't.
Anything?	Not yet.
Like the look of these?  I made them myself, to set him free.	Why did you wait so long?
So do you.  You've seen the future. Haven't you?	Yes.
He's good.	You haven't seen anything yet.
So why did you marry him?	That's my business. Harry.
Oh Christ.	Why don't you tell me the truth?
It's okay.	No it isn't.  You can't help me.
Nothing's going to happen to you.	Nothing?
What was that?	It's okay.
Oh God!	Hang on!
I've got to help him.	You can't.
Harry?	I'm okay.  I'm okay.
Is it finished?	I think so.
Where the fuck is he?	He got up and walked.
They weren't worth a damn.	I heard he was the best.
With what?	Evil.  He was evil.  Come on.
Whose is the car?	Mine.
What the fuck are you doing here?	Looking for you.  I tried the hotel.
I can't let you in.	Yeah, I know.
Him too.	We've got to get you to a hospital.
My God.	What?
Where'd you learn that?	What?
They got here before us.	Looks that way.
That's where we're all going.	In my time, and nobody else's.
This is where we killed him.	You didn't try hard enough.
He did something with the ground.	Yes?
Have we met before?	No.
Why's that?	He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything.  He made us think it was over and done with.
He's not!  He's not!	Who's not?
You could still help me do that.	Why would I want to?
You know I'll kill you when we're done.  I have to.	Yes.
Hello?	Bob, it's me.
Hi again, how's it going?	Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?
I could cut the ones that are left for you.	Ok.
I don't want to go home.	I know. I don't either.
Of course.	Do you want to have some breakfast?
You made it.	They really have to work on that street name thing.
It's for my daughter.	How old is she?
Nice one.	Fuck off.
It's bad isn't it?	We should get you to the doctor.
Where's your husband?	Working.
Oh, I guess you're busy, huh.	I don't want to be.
So, where'd you go today.	Around.
When are you leaving?	Tomorrow.
You're leaving right now?	Yes.
Yeah, its really different here.	Well, that's good, I have to get the kids off for school.  Can I call you in a little while?
Hello?	Bob?
Hello?	Hello, Bob, it's me.
I guess she's busy.	That's ok.
I don't know what to do.	That's ok, you'll figure it out.
You smell weird.	What?
Hair stuff?	I gotta go to work.
See you later.	Bye.
Do you think it's done?	I don't know.
Are you sure you want to stay?	Are you sure you have to go?
I miss you.	It'll just be a few days.
I missed you.	Do you think they have a room here?
What're these?	I don't know.  What are they?
George, come in.  What the hell happened to you?	It's nothing.
Is he going to be okay?	I hope so.
How're you doing?  Looking lovely as always.	You ready?
So what'd I miss?	You're right.  I must've made a mistake.
We needed to know all we could.	I'm going to look around.
You okay?	When's your birthday?
Plenty of time.	What are these?
He was trying to tell me something.	And his message was  "Together, no matter what?"
How much time do we have?	Not a lot.
Hello?	I know who he is.
You know what?  You can go.	Suit yourself.  But does this mean anything to you?
Would you sign it for me?	Of course.
What's the matter with you?	He's looking right at me.
He could see me.	I'll quit, maybe you should start.
Thanks again for everything.	Hey, don't thank me.  Somebody up there likes you.
What's up?	How're you doin' today?
I hate it.	Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?
Taste this.	I can't eat before a game.
What?	Nothing.  So good luck.
Hi.	Need any help?
She needs to stop running around like a little boy.	She's alright.
Which one for tomorrow?	The blue.
Okay.	Thanks, sweetheart.
So that means it's alright for you to act like that?	What'd you do?
You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house.	Really?  Well, come on, then.
I can take it.	This time get your feet set.
No, I mean I can check it for you.	Oh, sorry.
I'm an English major.  You like English?	Sort of.
That was nice.	Uh-huh.
It means a lot that you came by.	Yes, we appreciate that.
Damn, girl.	What?
So how long is this trip?	Four days.
That too tight?	No.
You ever been in love?	Too many times.
What's up?	Just wanted to say good game.
One, up.	Lucky.
I think we gotta kiss now.	For how long?
I don't have to do what you say.	Man, forget you then, stupid.
That's it, give it your best shot.	Would you watch the damn road?
See you made it.	Yeah.
Hey.	Hey.
Early night for you, isn't it?	I was about to ask you the same thing, going out with a college boy and all.
Why?	Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything.
Four.	What?
What was that about?	I know, right?
What?	You do see me standing here, right?
It's okay, little baby.	Quit.
Give me the ball.	My court, I go first.
I won.	I wanted you to.
Hey.	What's up?
Who was that?	Nobody.
Hey.	Hey, what's up.
Can we talk?	Talk to your new girlfriend.
What?	I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.
Just something I'm trying.	No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
Tried calling you a couple times.	Oh yeah?
It just isn't.	Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
It doesn't matter, alright.  Just leave it alone.	Find.
What's going on?	We need to talk.
You asked me what was missing.	What?
I'll play you.	What?
You're out of your mind.	So you're gonna bitch up?
What will this prove?	You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
Hey, girl.	Hey.
Give it yourself.	I don't wanna look fast.  Thanks, girl.
Not great.	What's that, not great?
What?	We still have to go?
Where's your dad?	Said he'd be home later.
You scared me.	Sorry.  You okay?
What people?	You know, people.
Sorry.	No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it.  It's not true.
From your mouth.	I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.
What do you want?	Came by to check on you.
You okay?  huh?  Jimmy?	And the book says: "We may by through with the past, but the past ain't through with us."
What the fuck do you want?	I want to sit.  I want to talk to you.
OPEN THE DOOR.	I'm coming!
Yes.	No one else in there with you?
You mind if I check things back here?	It's fine.
No, what's wrong?	You mind if I come in, check things?
You live alone?	Yes.
Hello.  You're back again, huh?	yeah, yes, hi, hello.
I'm fine. Yes. I'm fine.	Ready to go,go,go?
I - just - thought - that - I - didn't want - I - didn't - I - didn't -	It's ok, boy.
But you're alright now, so what's the what?	What?
I don't know.	You were gonna ask me weren't you?
Give me your keys, Don.	PLEASE DON'T DO THIS!
How's today then?	Fuckin' bullshit is what this is.
Hello?	Hi.  Is Frank there?
That's fine.  It's nice to meet you.	Are we gonna tape some stuff now?
C'mon, Frank.  What are you doing?	What am I doing?
He's in here.	Let's just wait one minute and stay here, okay?
You look great.	What the fuck is this, Jimmy?
Are you ok?	Fuck no.
I can't fuckin' do this.	Are you alright?
How you doing?	I'm drinking.
I don't think I want that.	It'll take the pain away.
That's it.	No one else that I know?
Jimmy, did you touch her?	I don't know.
I'm sorry.	It's alright.
Was it a call back?	No.  But I probably will get a call back.
Hello.	Hi.
The fuck is wrong with you?	I gotta go to the bathroom.
C'mon, man.	You're late, not me.
What's the problem, what's the problem here?	I'm fine. nothing.
I didn't I'm fine, I'm fine.	Stand up.
Are we gonna keep going with this game?	Yes.
Hi.	Hi.
Hi.	Hi.
There were two.  Not one.  But two.	I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
What had you to do with this, Mother?	He is your brother!
It can.  I know the way.	I am with you!
What is that?	A body.
Where are you going?!	Paris.  There is still much to do. We'll be back soon.  Be ready.
Once you are through, don't stop until you reach the river.	They will know you helped us, if we go this way.
Coming?	What use am I?
What do we do now?	I don't know about you, but I plan to wait here.
It worked!	It's a prison, you idiot!  They don't expect anyone to try getting in!  The problem will come when we want out!
It's been too long.	Life is too long.  Except when we have our friends.  Look at you! You're still a boy!  Sit, sit!  I'll open a bottle of wine.
Thanks, but not for me.	You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came.	I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
Where are you going?	To kill the king.
You mind if I ride with you?	Yeah, stick around, you might learn something.
Yeah?	Where are you?
Did you hit him?	I didn't hit shit!
I'll take the south end -	Fine -
Alright, where is she?	And who are you?
I was just having a little fun -	And what did he do to the girl?
Captain there's someone here to see you - he's waiting in your office.	Who is it?
Captain?	Yeah?
So where are you from?	Up north.
You always carry a gun with you?	No.
What's going on here?	You'll find out - soon enough.
Why did you set me up?	I didn't.  I figured you leave it well enough alone.
You know this time, there's nobody that's gonna cover your ass. You're over your head this time.	What else is new?
I can't help you anymore, Jimmy. I'm sorry.	I'm going to need a way to get there.
Don't you guys ever knock?	Where is he?
Long gone, huh?	I asked him not to tell me where he was going.  I told him I don't want any part of it.
How long do I have?	Twenty minutes max.
Whatever I say, you'll take him away, won't you?	I have to.
Is it weird?	The mark? Yes.
Who did he ask for?	You.
Will?	You wanna watch this or what?!
Ride with me.	Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I do it all the time.
Who is it?	It's me.
THEY WILL FIND OUT ABOUT YOU.  THEY WILL LOCK YOU IN A PLACE WORSE THAN BROTHER BUDDY'S.	No.
Do you see?	Yes.
Do you see?	Yes.
Do you have it?	Yeah. It's right here.
Do you know something about that?	Why do you think I called?
What the hell can I do?	What you've already decided. You're not really asking.
Meet point's up ahead!	Go on to the house.
Did the girl die?	No.
What kind of coffee do you like?	Huh?
Did you get my card?	I got it. Thank you.
No.	Do you know how you caught me, Will?
No.	"No"?  "No" to which part??
Andy?	Hi George!
Andy!	What's up?
I can't move my arm.	You've got good days and bad days.
Five.	Twenty!
Go away.	It's me.
I'm gonna quit.	What?!?
Sir, do you have a problem?	Yeah, my problem is you're tired.
If I find out you're behind this, I'll kill you.	What are ya TALKIN' ABOUT?!  I was the one saying I didn't believe it!
Is he in his room?	Of course he's in his room.  All his "friends" are in there.
I saw Michael!	Where?
JESUS CHRIST!!!!!	Why isn't he MOVING??
You don't know.	Know what?
Lieutenant?	Oh shit.
He's gonna make it.	No way.  Not possible.
Weird.	What?
What?!	Oh, God.
You're two hours late.	I know.  It's her fault.
You got the money?	Two grand.
Don't be ridiculous.	We're going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  He's going to die just like the others.
Did you hear that?	Hear what?
You are a beautiful woman.  Too bad things had to work out like this.	You killed them.
I don't believe it!  I don't believe it!	He's going to pop!
What is he doing?	He's beginning to believe.
How long?	Five minutes.  Maybe six.
Holy fucking shit!	Yes.
What the fuck do they want with me?!	I'm not sure, but if you don't want to find out, you better get out of there.
Good.  Now there is a window.  Open it.	How do you know all this?
Why do my eyes hurt?	You've never used them before.
Get some rest.  You're going to need it.	For what?
I thought it wasn't real.	Your mind makes it real.
Set down in there.	What's going on?
How is he?	Ten hours straight.  He's a machine.
Now left and that's it in front of you.	Good.
I'm going to make the call.	Do it!
Do you want to go somewhere and talk?	No.  It's safe here and I don't have much time.
Did you go to her?	Yes.
Go!	We can't leave him!
What happened?	I don't know.  It just went dead.
What are you doing?	I'm going in after him.
What?	I believe I can bring him back.
What are you doing?	I'm coming with you.
No one has ever done anything like this.	Yeah?
Are you all right?	I'm fine.  Come on, we have to keep moving.
Can you fly that thing.	Not yet.
Morning.  Did you sleep?	No.
It's locked.	Kick it in!  Kick it in!
Yes.  They're moving him.  I don't know where yet.	He's alive.
What just happened?	I don't know.  I lost him.
No.	That means it's good.
Yeah.	Ok.  Wait here.
Ok, you guys get out, and wait here for me.	Why?
No.	Anybody wanna have a game?
I don't think I should go home looking like this.  You think I could stay at your place tonight? Your mother's not there is she?	No, she isn't.
Let's get out of here.	Did you see them run!
Don't you move!!!	I'll be here.  Don't worry.
Back so soon.	Mind your own business.
I think we should see your uncle.	No.
What are you going to do?  Hide me?	Good idea.
Hey, shut up.	Get him in.
Out!!!!	C'mon Johnny.
Look, Michael, I'll get him here. What do you want me to do, kill him?	Whatever.
Where's the rest?	Yeah, where's the rest?
You're really crazy.	You're not going to use that gun, Johnny.
Uncle, how are you feeling?	Fine.  Did you have a good time last night?
Take a drink!	Ok.
Oh yes, he's pretty good.	What I don't understand is why you have to go to college to read these books that you're gonna read anyway.
I'd like to eat something before I go back to work.	Ok, we'll go for lunch.
Just keep him quiet.	Friends of yours Michael.
Look who's talking.	Yeah, speak for yourself.
Dinner?  Again?	Haven't you had enough of us, Dad?
Did he?  That's more than we get to do.	Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along.
Daddy.  Does your friend have a name?	A name?
You know, darling, this is going to be a wonderful party.	Yes, it is.
Yes, sir?	Hello.  I'm Joe Black.  Nice to meet you.
What are you eating.	You mean this, sir?
Hello, Beautiful.	Hi.
Nice to see you.  I didn't expect you, but certainly you can't get enough of a good thing.	Thank you.
Anything else, Mr. Black?  How about some water?	Why yes, thank you.
What do you think the Board is going to say when I tell them that?	I don't care.
Whose?	Yours.
Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, Bill?	I don't think so.  Do you?
And what do I get?	You get not to go to jail.
Well, I guess he's found one.	Joe, you do get around.
Not time yet.	Make it time.
Oh, you come to see Doctor Lady?	Yes.
How long you here, Joe?	As long as it takes.
Black.	Hey, this is fun.
Don't bother asking, we already tried.	It's so very nice to see you again.
What are you doing here?	I'm lost.
She's in a great deal of pain.	Yes.
No, I'm not.	Girlfriend?
Where are you going?	To bed.
You first.	Why don't you get off his case?
Almost.	I said get out.
Thank you.	It was everything.
Yes?	I don't know who you are.
You're here?	I am.
Did you like making love to me?	I loved it.
Yes.  Your father and I, our time together has come to an end.	Where are you going?
I can tell you the when part.  Tonight.	It gets worse.
What a good idea.	Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?
Good morning.	Good morning, Bill.
And what?	And I won't tell anyone who you are.
I want to live.	I understand.
What's it like?	What do you mean?
Would you like to sit down, Joe?	Yes.
Now I'd like to be alone.	Oh.  Okay.
Are you going to eat your lunch	It's all yours.
And more.	Why didn't you stop me?
Dinner?  Absolutely.	Absolutely.
Why did you go to the hospital?	I don't know.
Okay.  Goodnight.	Goodnight.
I'm not hungry.	Then I can't help you.
I couldn't sleep.	I'm sorry to hear that.
Yes, I saw you see me.	Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.
You are?	Yeah.
Thanks.	Not at all.
What the hell do you care?	I was just asking, Bill.
You're what?	I think you heard me, Bill.
I don't like what you're saying.	I don't expect you to.
Okay.	Get him in here.
Happy Birthday, Bill.	Thank you.
Yes.	That's life.  What can I tell you?
Yes.	Death!
Excuse me?  Could I say something?	Of course.
What are you talking about?	What you were talking about.
Where are you?  Are you there?	It's enough now.
Where are you?	I'm here.
About what?	I want to have a look around before I take you.
But he does give a shit.  Don't you, Bill?	Yeah, I give a shit.
Why don't we let it rest for the moment?  Give it some air?	Well said, Eddie.  Mr. Black, shall we?
Eddie?	Yeah - Bill - How are you?  You okay?
Good morning, Dad.	Hi, honey.
Thank God.	He doesn't care.  But thanks anyway.
Daddy, what's the matter?	Nothing.  I'm sorry.
You know each other?	We've met.
That was wonderful.	Yeah, it's good to get together.
Where's Joe?	Joe?
Where is he?	I don't know.
I love him.	I don't care if you love him!  I'm telling you he's no good for you!
So if I needed a doctor, you could be it?	I could be her.
Not at all.	How 'bout another cup of coffee?
Well, what then?	It's simple, you just go to the bathroom.
Should I wear it?	No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.
You don't know?	I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.
My wife.	What's it like?
How long have I been here?	Couple days.
What makes you think he's my friend?	Seen you together, that's all.
Shit. Wrong room.	What?
What?	Who did this to you?
I like your car.	Thanks.
Jimmy?	What the fuck are you doing here?
Why?	I don't want blood on them.
Yeah.	So you have information for me?
Sleep okay?	Yeah. You?
Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.	Who is he? What have you got me into?
How do I know he did that to you?	I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
It's not easy to be calm when -	Just relax.
His name was Jimmy.	What happened?
What do the police think?	They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
Me? Why would he be interested in me?	I told him about your car.
What's wrong?	Somebody's come. Already.
Neither do I.	Don't protect him.
Calm down.	That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
They're not looking for him.	Why not?
You can stay here for a couple of days if it'll help.	Thank you.
On the house.	Thanks.
My wife.	Sweet.
Beer, please.	What do you want?
There's a dress code?	What are you here for?
You're the memory guy?	How do you know about me?
I don't know. I'm sorry.	You have no idea where you've just come from? What you've just done?
How can you read that again?	It's good.
What the hell you want to go there for?	You know it?
Why?	Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.
You don't know him?	No! Should I?
I don't think so.	Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what -	No. No, just let me think for a minute.
We've got to get him out of here.	He's got to have a car, right? We just take him back to his car and tell him to get the fuck out of town before we kill him.
It must be his. I don't think they'd let someone like me carry a gun.	Fucking hope not.
She's gonna use you. To protect herself.	From who?
Happy now?	I won't be happy until you leave town.
What's wrong?	There's a guy in here, hurt bad! We gotta get him to a doctor!
It is now.	You can't just take it!
Yeah.	What's your twenty?
I thought we had to meet the Man.	You do.
We want it back.	Okay.
How fast does that go?	It goes very fast.
Tell me everything.	No.
No part of it wasn't real.	I know.  And now?
Yeah.	And what do I do with him?
Anything?	Nothing.
How much we looking for?	Nothing.
What's your take?	What's the point?  It's going down.
How?	We don't know.
You okay?	Yeah.
Then what were we talking to you for?	I had to lay eyes on you.
I can tell, can't you?	Yeah, oh yeah.
What for?	So you could sleep! I mean Christ!
Yeah.	History, man, history. How much?
It's there!	What?
DAD!	Oh Jesus! 
You know where they are?	Sure.
How's it feel?	About as good as it looks.
What they give you?	Twelve years.
Hello, Billy.	Hello.
I want you to know we're going to do everything, in our power to get you out as soon as possible. Believe me.	Thank you.
What's wrong?	Sit down a moment, Billy.  I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.
What do you mean LIFE FOR FOR WHAT! FOR WHAT!	Billy!  Please!
You got your stuff?	Yeah.
Okay?	Yeah!
What time is it?	Two thirty.
His name?	Who?
Excuse me, I'm talking to you.	No, you talkin' at me.
Oh, that's gonna work.	You got a better way up?
You better tell me what the hell's going on here!	Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!
It would take a minute or so.  You won't last that long out there.	Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!
He didn't do it!	What?
He was just doing his job.	Fine, then I'm the bad guy. Jesus!
Don't.	Listen to me:  we're getting you out.
Oh, come on, come on!	Jump in.
It bit you.	No shit.
My God.	What?
But what?	Nothing.
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.	It's fine.
Thank you so much.	My pleasure.
For a while I thought I might go crazy.	I know how that can be.
You want me to burn my book?	Yes.
See, isn't this nice?	Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
Here, in case you think of any ideas.	Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much.
I hope you like it.	It looks wonderful. And so do you.
Paul, I know you've been out.	What?
Yes, Paul.	I'm almost done.
You won.	I suppose I did.
To win?	What else?
Do you know me?	No.  Should I?
What are you doing here?	Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
Would you mind if I'm on top?	Oh, either way works for me.
I wouldn't do that.	Do what?
Ask a question, you get an answer!..	Damn, you're beautiful.
How's it going?  Everything okay?	Just like old times.
I want you out of there.	Why?  What's happened. What did you see?
Are you okay?	I am now.  Get me out of here.  Just get me out of here.
No.  Should I?	No.  You just looked as if you did.
An idea, yeah.	Like?
If he didn't want to go anywhere without me, how did you get him on the flight?	You were there.
I don't think I can get her to do it.	You mean it'll be difficult.
Something else?	Aren't you even curious?  About why she did it?
So what did he say?	Good job.  And thanks.
A visit from an old friend.	What's happening here?  You're dead!
Is he serious?	Always.
Did we get it?	We got it.  On your feet.
The message is for Job.	I'm going to answer it.
Reach your folks?  How they feeling?	About what?
Who are you and what are you doing here?	I need one hundred thousand dollars.
Wait!  Hold it - it's on. Let's go.	Let's move!
Jack.  Jack.	I didn't touch it.
You're going to use Walter?	He's our guy.
Oh, you're not going. You're staying.	No, I'm going.
I don't wanna talk about it.	Well, what do you wanna talk about!
Have I been a good wife?	Yes.
Where's Ma?	Bed.
Why you looking around so much?	I don't know. I got a feeling.
I won't have to shoot those dogs. They will kill each other.	You think so, huh, Stupid? Those dogs love each other.
Yes!	Hurry up, hurry up. We open in five minutes.
Have you come from my brother?	Yes.
Why?	Why what?
She was right to leave me.	You think so?
Son of a bitch!	Where are you taking me?
I can't believe what is happening.	Me neither.
What?	That light.
Oh my God.	What?
What? What have we done?	Take it easy.
Hi.	Hi.
Thank you!	For what?
So. Where are we sitting?	Come on.
No thanks.	I think that's it.
What do you want to do now?	I wanna go home.
What's the matter?	How can you ask me that?
This is your place.	That's right.
You've gotta get outta here.	No. I'm gonna wait.
No, I'll tell him.	No, I'll tell him.  What am I going to tell him?
I got things to do.	Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff.
Is there anything you want to tell us, honey?	You? No.
You don't want the fish.	No?
A man who can't control his woman is funny.	She was too young for him.
Have Something.	I shouldn't.
What about the wedding?	My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married.
I'll call you when I get to Mama's house.	You've made me very happy, Johnny.
Johnny, I have something to tell you.	I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone.
What?	Where's the ring?
No.	Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him?
Will you live here?	No.
So we'll sell the house.	I got married before, you didn't sell.
How's the mother?	She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
Hi.	Where you been?
What the hell happened to you?	Well. I don't really know where to start.
Moving in?	I came right from the airport.
So.	Where is she?
That's it! That's the reason!	I don't know.
Can I get another one of these?	Definitely!
May I walk with you a ways?	Sure.
You knew that man?	Yes.
That's my house.	You mean the whole house?
She's got it.	I knew she had it.
The same!	Who are they?
None shall pass.	What?
There!  Look!	What does it say?
Who are they?	Oh, just some friends!
Too late.	What?
Where?	There.
Old woman!	Man!
Bring out your dead!	Here's one!
Don't be such a baby.	I can't take him.
I can't.	Well, can you hang around a couple of minutes.  He won't be long.
Where are you going?	We're coming with you.
Oh!	Don't say that word.
And she sent no word down?	They said you were drunk.  Why don't you tell her the truth?
She'll drop you.  When she's done with you, she'll drop you.	Get out.  Out!
I wish to see my mother.	She's busy.
Do you?	Yes.  I do.
They don't see it.	See what?
What are those?	What?
They're ready now.	I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.
What is it, John?  John?	I heard something.
John?	Yes, ma'am?
Ma'am?	Yes?
I stay here because I am happy.  Is that such a terrible crime?	No, ma'am.
What did he want?	To know when he'll be king.
We're going to lose.	You can't know that for sure.
A fine choice, sir.	Excellent!
I'm sorry, ma'am?	Cold is good!
How long has he been this sick?	A few days, ma'am.
Read it.	Again?
Who told them that?	I have no idea.
There is one other matter.	What is it?
Sick?	Everybody's sick, huh?  It's fifteen after.  We always meet here, you know that.
Hello?	Hey, kid.
Something's happened to them.	It's the middle of the night.  They're asleep.  Phone didn't wake them.
Because I didn't know where else to go.	It's two o'clock in the morning.  Go home. Go to sleep.  We'll figure something out in the morning.
It's not this weird.  It'll make sense. Everything gets weird this late anyway, right?	Sure.
Where do we go?	My house.  I want to try something.
That's what I thought.	What?
Anywhere.  We have to stop it from getting out.	It's already out.
Jesus Christ!	I can't believe you made it!
You don't get it, do you?	What?
You feel it?  It's different this time.	We're actually inside, aren't we?
Our time's up.	What?!  There's nothing here!
We can't reach that!	We don't have a choice!
Go for it.	Hold my keys, then.
Then we'll go home?	Then we'll go home.
Which way?	That way.
It's the wrong way!	In this world, wrong is right!
What did he do to you?	Is that your question?
So what do you think?	Sign me up.
Cool.	Can you say anything but "cool"?
So what's the problem?	There is no problem.
You'd better fix this, Ray!!!	I'll speak to someone.
Beautiful night.	Yeah.
Well, just stop for a little second and think about it. Will ya do that for me?	Okay, I'm thinking.
It will work out.	Good then, but, just in case, that bank's gonna stay closed a bit longer. You understand that?
I guess I've come to quite a place.	Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.
Get going. You don't want to be late.	Right. See ya.
Hi.	Well. Shall we get to it? Would you like a water or a coffee before we begin?
You're still here?	I came back. I thought that's what you wanted.
No.	But, this could be serious.
What's wrong?	I don't know who I am.
I don't know.	You don't remember anything else?
There's nothing?	Not that I can see.
No. Just the coffee.	We'll take our check.
Strange to be calling yourself.	Maybe it's not me.
What's wrong with that?	I'm not sure about this.
"You're still here?"	"I came back. I thought that's what you wanted."
"Before I kill you."	"Then they'd put you in jail."
Don't stop!	What is it? What do you see?!
Yeah, sure. Look what happened to them.	No, no, no, I told you. They're fine. They're all real happy.
You're so easy.	Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.
Why did you want to go to breakfast if you're not hungry?	I just wanted to come here.
You feel it?	Yeah.
Is that it ?	Yeah, I'd say that's it.
Where are we ?	No time. Get him up.
Why don't you tell us what the fuck is going on ?	Why should I ?
Now where do we go ?	I don't know.
What are you doing ?	I'm leaving.
Hey ! Hey ! I'm talking to you !	What ?
So you're telling me you were set up ? I knew something was wrong.	I'm not listening.
So why this ?	Excuse me ?
Do you know where you're going ?	Yes.
What about you ?	There's one more person here for me to visit.
What are you DOING here ?	I work here, remember ?
It's fine thanks.	Why don't you tell us a little about yourself ?
Is it over ?	Almost. Look, you two get out of here.
Don't.	What ?
Why don't you just stop fucking around and just die !	I'm sick of playing. I've got a better idea.
You think I'm that easy, Bitch ?	For once in your life, shut the fuck up.
Is it as good as I hope it is ?	Better, sir.
No. I was just curious if what I heard about you is true ?	What did you hear ?
What's next ?	I have a turn for the worse for the team !
Look he figured it out !	I can see your small business ! Look at it it's so small.
Look ! Look !	Shit, I forgot about them. Well, I guess the boss man wasn't as tough as I thought.
Was that the Old Man ?	Yes. I think he's feeling sick or something.
There ! There ! Did you see ! They're still alive !	I can see that but where ?
Hello.	Hi. I brought some wine.
Are you okay ?	Yes, Excuse me for a second.
Not now, Mom.	Wake up, we're in trouble.
Hey, you ! What the hell is going on ?	What the hell kind of cop are you ?
How's your foot ?	"How's your foot" ? This guy tried to kill us and he put us in this place, and you want to know how his foot is ?
What now ?	I want to go to sleep for about a month.
He was right behind me !	Who was that guy anyway ?
Good morning.	Good morning.
People said she looked like me.	I was drinking a little in those days.  I'm drinking a little these days too.
THANK YOU.	Don't mention it.
Give us a break. All you have to do is make a phone call.	I thought I told you to lose this guy.
You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?	Of course.
Bye Dad, I'll miss you.	Thanks, I needed that.
Bye.  She looks a little like me when I was a little girl.	Does she?
I'm glad you're here.	You are?
Hi.	Come on in!
What's the matter?	He likes you.
Hello.	Hi.
This is really very nice of you.	It's no problem, I had a mother once myself.
Getting off please.	Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me.
Don't forget, the girls change their names if they got married.	I'd never do that.
I don't think anybody should change their names, that way you can always find them when you need them.	What if you don't wanna be found?
Do you think your friend's up in Heaven now, looking down on you and watching you all the time?	Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.
Hey relax, I'm not gonna break it.	Give it to me!
What are you doing? You can't go in there!	Oh no?!?!?!
It's dangerous!!	Leave me alone!!
Right.	And you'd be my cousin?
What's that?	Ten bucks.
Lock the door.	Bye.
Wait, are you saying that I don't appreciate?	I'm saying he asked me out for coffee, like a real date, when was the last time you did that?
I think this place is just fine.	You know how I feel about you.
I'm just tired.	All right, well get to bed early and don't let anybody in. Bye.
So what's wrong?	Nothing, nothing at all.
Good morning.	Well maybe for you.
Why not now?	What do you mean?
Did it hurt a lot?	You have no idea.
Hey, you didn't pay me!	How do I know you were gonna show us one?
Can't you see it?	No.
Excuse me, what about the job?	Pardon?
Hi.	Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
I just had a terrible thought Harry.	What's that?
Would you like to come in and see my house? Just for a minute.	Okay, sure.
Home sweet home.	It's nice.
Yeah.	Are you mad at me?
Dance with me?	Here?
Rock?	See, you're not that out of touch.  You're good.
Do you want to?	Want to what?
Watch you don't knock out a fish.	Perfect.
Of course not.	Then who's it for?
Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?	That's a lot of money for a little girl.
Dad?	I love this guy! 
When?	Soon honey, soon.
He's gone sweetheart. He's gone!	Get away, get away!!
Did I kill my mother?	What??
I found this.	I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?
Oh yes, oh that's great.	I'm very nervous.
I paid the money.	For this class?
Cause she's dying.	Do you think she is?
Did you read ALL these books?	Uh huh.
Are you going out somewhere?	No.
I won, I won!!!	Oh great!!
NO!	Yes!!
It's okay sweetheart.	I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again.
Goodnight.	Goodnight.
I knew he wouldn't come.	I can't, I have to go home.
No, I'm going home.	Why? It's not dinner time yet.
Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.	Hey, we can become blood brothers.
Is that your Dad?	Yes.
Here.	Don't DO that!!
Can we go yet?	Go???
THIS!! 	HEY YOU!!!!  I'm gonna get you!!!  I'll get you!!!!
Run faster they're after us!!	I am running faster!!
Jump in the water!!	But I have my clothes on!
So now you'll have a mother.	I don't like her.
Just do it.	Okay, okay.
Long trip.  Pretty nice of you to come.	Well, I'm close to her.  I wanted to meet the one that got away.
He can't do that to me!	We're about to find out.
I give.	I can't even say it.
I suppose it's too late to start over.	It's too late to start over.
You're going to say it, aren't you?	Tell him you love him.  With all your heart.
I did what I came to do.	Good girl.
I'll think about it.  I'm okay.	Oh, you're more than okay.
Excuse me?	I can be quick.  I can even be funny.
That's why Michael and I were the wrong fit.  Right from the start.	He said that, too.
He'll see right through it.	Only.  If he wants to.
Best everything, Joe.  But I'm going to dance with you.	Dance?  You don't dance!  You learn to dance??
Wow and wow.  You have a date, after this?	Never can tell.
You miss her, huh?	No.  I've got you.
Don't you throw up on boat?	If you like.
I've been thinking a lot the last couple days.  About us, actually.	Have you.
I can hardly wait for your wedding.	Me either.
Takes me back.	Well.
Will she like it?	Yes.
Listen up, huh? Even if you blow this deal, how big could it be?	You're right.  Easy come, easy go.
What happened?	It's over.
This is her family and her fault.	And your point?
Thank God you were here.	Oh, yeah.
I never forgot that.	It's two weeks.
You got the money?	Right here.
Don't worry, I'll take care or it	You're so good.
Well, Bye, Bye now. We have to go.	Bye, Bye.
How is she?	A little slow, but she'll be fine.
You want anything?  A drink?	Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.
What's he running for?	President.
Okay.	Okay.
Bastard	Stop it!
President?	When is it?
You're kidding.	How come?
Where are you going?	To the bathroom.
You bet.	I'll just be in here.
Mr. Green?	Yes, ma'am. How are you today?
Yes, sir.	Can I help you?
Uh huh.	She's been in the hospital two weeks yesterday.
Have you seen a woman about so high?	No.
Mom?	I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
Okay. I'll be talking to you.	Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you.
I'd really like to see you.	Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you.
Hello.	Hi.
Hello.	Wow!
Stay.	I can't.
When did you think it would happen?	I'm not sure.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.	That's what you said before.
All I need is fifteen minutes a night.	Fifteen minutes?
Oh, no.	He's pretty well known down here.
Sorry I'm late.	You're not.
You know Bill is really mad at you.	Oh?
We just got a gold record.	Do they have a show to give it to you?
Come on back to bed.	Yeah, you bet. You're really terrific. You know what I mean?
Hi.	Hello.
Pleasure	Where is she?
You want a ride into town?	You bet.
Say something.	What?
How is it?	Not good.
Sorry about that.	Don't worry about it.
You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?	Sure.
C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.	So, what now?
Yes.	Yes.
What the hell happened to you?	You should see the other bitch. What time you got?
Yeah, we met. They're good men.	They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?
Jack, could you stay up here for a while?	Yeah, sure.
Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?	Lose 'em.
Where' you goin'?	Out.
I said: Cut it out!	Don't start no trouble, boy!
I know.	You' new here, man!  See you, boys.
Yeah.	Where was that?
Thanks.	Would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
That's two bucks, Joe.	Why don't you come over for a beer when you get through?
Thank you, Ma'am. That's fine.	You must be new in town.
Haven't seen you around, have I?	No. I'm new in town.
Oh yeah?	You work around town?
Hell!	What is it?
Ain't your fault.	That's the way he is.
How old is your boy?	Four.
Hi.	I thought you wasn't comin'.
How did it go?	What?
Thank you.	How about it?
What about him?	He could live with us.
Is that so?	Yeah, that's so.
What about them?	Am I as good as they?
You know how to box?	Uh-huh. Why?
Like so. There you go. Okay, hit me!	I don't want to hurt you.
Ain't that something?!  That's just fine, baby.	We'll be all right.
Yeah. But just how're we goin' to make out? I got to get me a job.	You will.
Hi.	Don't ask, baby - huh!  How much money you got with you?
Don't do that!	Watch out!
You heard me!	I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
Ain't you goin' to say something?	There's nothing to say.
Where're you going to go?	When I get set, I'll send for you.
Just get her drunk.	How 'bout the key?
How about a drink?	Okay.
I asked you somethin', boy!	I heard you.
Couldn't get the words out before.	Better get him to a hospital.
How you doin', boy?	Okay.
Want me to hold the light for you?	No, thanks.
Seems a little loose!	She'll do.
Jesus, I told you to watch it!	Sorry.
That's the trouble with you boys! Don't listen when a man tells you something.	She don't look no worse to me.
Come back some other time, will you?	Yeah, sure. Good luck.
Come on, Pop.	Nothing you can do. Been like this for days.
Want to come up the house? You can stay there till you get on your feet. There's no point paying a hotel.	No thanks, Lee.
Hello.	How are you?
It's hard to know how to talk to the white folks these days.	Guess it's never been easy.
I know just how you feel, son. But believe me, you're going about it the wrong way.	Don't look like there's a right way.
So I been told.	It's for your own good.
Come on, Will.	What's the matter?! You mad at me?
He's your son.	Okay, boy, beat it.
Now you stay put!	I ain't drunk, honey.
Let's go.	Anything you say, baby.
Peter said you came to kill us. Is that true?	No. I only needed the code from you.
Alright. Let's talk business.	Why not?
You ran without us.	I cannot tell a lie. Sorry.
Tell me the words.	The words?
I saw your girl yesterday.	I don't have a girl.
Yo.	How are we doing?
Yo.	How's the ice break?
You're late.	How's the ice?
Hello, Case.	I thought you already left.
You've been calling her name.	What?
How long have I been out?	Almost two days.
That's not going to help.	The way I feel, believe me, it'll help.
I'm going in.	You're not ready yet. They said two days.
I'll get the car.	They'll cut you down.
I'm still going in.	Hold on.
Get up.	What?
What the fuck kind of questions are those?	Shut up.
What?	Well, do you?
Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.	Yeah, I know.
Hi. You're here for the sex talk?	Well. I like a man who gets to the point.
Oh my god.	Dude, you rock!
Hey there.	Hey. There.
What!?	Do you remember high school?
This seat taken?	Thank you.
Boys.	I know.
Please. Please don't walk away.	I just can't look at you the same way.
Yes.	What?
Are you having fun?	Yeah. Definitely.
By name.	Lock.
Not at all!	We can handle it.
Where're we taking him?	Where?
Yes.	For this.
You're mine, you know.  I made you.	I know.
Taste it.	But why?  It's your lunch. There isn't much there in the first place.
Where are you going?	Just out for a while.
Help me with this thing!	It's not the gas, Dad!
I don't know.  COuldn't get the right price, I suppose.	And you don't know anything about a murder across the street and a crazy girl who lived here - who saw the whole thing?
What?	It's happening again.
Aren't you afraid somebody could steal your car like that?	Look at this car.  Are you kidding?
Hi!  You didn't have to wait.	That's okay, I wanted to.
You okay?	Yeah, yeah, sure.
I figured you might like some help.	Yeah?
Are you sure?	World History.  But, I'll see you in the morning, right?
No. Never.  You think that's what it is?	I don't know.
Here.	What's this?
So, you feeling anything?	What do you mean?
Will you stop and tell me what's wrong?	I'm fine.  Nothing's wrong.
You should eat something - you'll feel better.	I'm not hungry.
I think I better go.  I'm just not into it tonight.  I'm sorry.	Why won't you talk to me?
Hi.	Hi.
So, school going alright?	Okay, I guess.
Maybe we should call a doctor.	No.  I'm okay.
Morning.	How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
What's that?	We're gonna stay out of your way tomorrow night.
We're going up to bed now.	Thanks, Mom.
And you don't want to keep him waiting.	That's right.  I don't.
What?	I had such an awful dream.
Can we talk?  Just for a minute?	Can't it wait till morning?
Girl, what are you doing?	Watching TV.
If you get caught, I never saw you. Deal?	Deal.  Thanks.
You didn't think we'd let you go alone?	No fuckin' way.  We're a team.
I'm glad things have worked out for you.	I think new York was just what I needed.  So many people.  I never feel alone.
That man in my dreams.  He's real isn't he?	He's real.
I haven't been able to do that since I was a little girl.	You did it the other night.
What's that?	I don't know.
Are you okay?	I think so.
Hi, sweet stuff.  Good news.	Can't be good news coming from you.
You need me, I'll be here all night.	Thanks, Max.
You got five minutes.	Thank you.
You're late.	Didn't get much sleep.
This is nice.	Never been here before?
To who?	Doesn't matter.
We can try again.	Everybody take five.
What are we going to do?	There's nothing we can do.  It's out of our hands.
We've got work to do.	What are you talking about?
What was that?	What?
Somebody else is out here.	No.  We're alone.
Why is he after us?	Yeah?  What did we ever do?
I'm in.	Me too.
No!	Night, night, Honey.
No, thanks.  I'll just look around.	Fine.
Oh Jesus.	Here, let me help.
Would you like a cup of tea before you go?	No thanks.
Thank you.	Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.
Oh hi.  Forget something?	I forgot my bag.
Hello.  Hi.  Hi.	Hi.
Hi.	Hello.
Are you busy tonight?	Yes.
So who left who?	She left me.
To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.	You've got to go.
Hi.  Can I come in?	Come in.
You've got big feet.	Yes.  Always have had.
Wow.	What?
Can I stay a bit longer?	Stay forever.
What?	Don't ask.
How are you doing?	How do you think I'm doing?
Hi.	Hello.
Excuse me.	Yes.
That's right.	And this is William.
What happened?	It was good.
Well?	She's perfect, perfect.
Oh God no.	So not over her, in fact.
Hello.	May I help you, sir?
No, sir.	Right.  Right.  Fair enough.  Thanks.
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.	Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
I wouldn't go outside.	Why not?
Which floor?	Three.
Excuse me.	Yes.
Get up, Billy.	No! No! No!
Say it again.	Thank you.
In there.	Wow! They're so quiet.
What for?	What for?
They must be up there!	Yeah!
There they are!	Hey, what's that?
What are you doing?	I'm seeing what a busy man does.
Gimme the ball!	No. Me! Me!
I wanna go home!	Yeah, it's cold!
My turn.	No.
Time out!	Time out!
Yeah, buddy?	Are you a doctor?
You think it's funny, huh?	Yeah, you don't know how to get outta this place!
You want me to show ya! You want me to show ya how!	Yeah, yeah, show me. Show me how!
Bullshit. You ain't got no way out!	Oh, yeah?
Hey, how ya doin'?	Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these.
Please follow me.	You an' me, Chief.
Who is he?	He's in charge.
Hi.	Hi.
Yeah!	Big man!
Yes, sir, I sure am gonna enjoy my stay here.	I'm sure you will.
What happened?	What's that?
She was your sister.	No, she wasn't my sister.
Great.  Because, like I said, until you find it, we can't let you on the plane.	You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?	Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.
There is one other thing you should know about me.	Nothing you could say would change the way I feel.
Congratulations.	Thanks.
It's an amazing place, don't you think?	Amazing.
I'm sure he'll be sorry to hear that.  Who should I tell him called?	My name's 
WAIT!!  Where are you?	I'm at the airport.  Why?
That's not the point.	You said whatever it was you would understand.
How could you do this to me?	I'm in love with you.
Why can't you just tell me?	If it's any of your business, yes.
Don't you see?..  We're not the ones who are meant to be.  You're the man of somebody else's dreams.	Because I don't have the right name?!
Why not?	Because.  I know where he is.
Uh, I'd rather not say.	Tell me.
Do you want me to do it?	NO.
Hi, Peter.	Hi.
So.  You found him.	You found him.  I don't know how to thank you.
Oh, thanks.  Well, have a good time.	You too.
You okay?	Yeah.
Promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye.	No.  Course not.
It seems like ever since I found out about this guy, this name, I've been kind of crazy.  Like I was on drugs or something.	I know the feeling.
Is something the matter?	GET OUT!!
Been here long?	Just since yesterday.
Sure.	You would?  Really?
Wait.	Yes?
So, what are we waiting for?	What?
No.	Is he married?
But what?	Oh, I don't know.  I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be.  You know, like in the movies.
You okay?	Sure.  I'm fine.  I don't know why I never did this before.  I mean, what's the big deal?
I can't believe we came all this way and he's gone.	You gave it your best shot.  You tried.
What are you doing?	He fell out.
We're saved!	What is it?
Your brother?	What was I gonna do?  Tell him the truth?
Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?	Because I'm the one who's single.
No.  No, you go ahead.	You sure you'll be okay?
Peter found him?	Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
Maybe I can change him.	I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.
I'm fine.  Have you seen Peter?	He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.
This is the last one before the wedding, right?	Right.
I came after the woman I love.	He missed me.
I have to talk to her.	She's not here.
Oh, it's you.  It's only Peter.	Thanks.
Right now?	He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.
You got a real friend here, kid. Don't forget it.	Why should he forget it?
You said they was only going to talk to him.	That was the idea.
Come on, kid. I'll buy you a drink.	In a minute.
Working hard?	It's a living.
What happened?  What happened?	Tommy, what happened?
I changed my mind. I feel real mean tonight.	Good. So do I.
Listen, you like beer?	I don't know.
Where you goin'?	Let me by.
Never will be much too soon.	Take it easy.
Is Johnny in?	No.
Count this.	Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
You know what I mean. Leave her alone.	I was only talkin' to her.
Well we certainly can't stay here. C'mon.	Where?
I love you Bob. I really do. Forgive me?	There's nothing to forgive. It was all a dream.
They are live ones?	Yes, Master.
Have we in some way made you angry, Master?	You know better than that.
I want to speak with you, please.	Who is it?
Lie face down on the floor.	What?!
The FBI didn't tell you I was with them?	They didn't tell me anything, they asked questions.
You didn't visit him in prison.	He didn't want me to.
Ask him his name.	Who are you?
You're good.	Thank you.
We may as well leave her, we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what's the difference where?	She's coming with us.
I'm just saying she wasn't scared.	Cause she had her hand on her gun the whole time, waiting to make her move.
What?!	You better come see this.
Outside of that.	Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us.
Now that's a really big house.	Jesus, look at that wall.  Place almost looks like a prison.
They put a gun on you, you'll go back.	They put a gun on you, you still have a choice, don't you?
And she saw you?	Yes, she did.
You know they gonna set us up.	I get that feeling, yeah.
They found the safe.	You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
Come on.	Shit.
We made it, didn't we?	All you gotta do is get in.
I'm going back inside.	I'll go with you.
Put it down or I'll shoot.	You wouldn't shoot me, would you?
You can live or die, it's up to you.	Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot me?  Nice girl like you?  I don't think so.
Quite a mess.	Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
Other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together.  You gonna tell me why you're comin' to me instead of the FBI?	I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.
Hello?	We're a few minutes away.  Just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand?
Soon as we leave here.  Stop home and pick up what we need and go do it.	Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.
You know how to use one a these?	I've seen 'em used on TV.
Good luck, Richard.	Someone down here?
You don't seem all that scared.	Of course I am.
I never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick.	Really.
You know who this is?	Yes.
You really wear that suit.	That's not what you were about to say.
What were you gonna do with me?	I don't know.  I hadn't worked that part out yet.  All I knew was that I liked you, and I didn't want to leave you there, never see you again.
You know I saw you on the street.	Where?
You coming back?	I'm just going to the bathroom.
I want you to know something.  I wasn't looking for just a fuck, if that's what you're thinking.	Why are you mad?
You getting serious on me now?	I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know what's gonna happen.
I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot you.	You just did, for Christ sake.
Whose blood you got all over you?	These guys, man, they're crazy.  Shit.
Some people are going out of here. What if I told you where and when?	How many?
Thanks for your help.	Any time.
Tell me something.  What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up?	I don't know.  I never used a gun.
I still haven't made up my mind yet.	What's to think about?
What do you want from me, Jack?  Name it.  You want money?	You gonna write me a check?
Do we have a gun in the car?	I remember you now.  Shit.
You there?	Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here. Question is, why aren't you here?
Thing I'm worried about is you.	Me?
That was some shit, huh?	Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
Hi, Ray.	You look great.  Your dad taking good care of you?
How's it going?	Great.  We got one of 'em.
You like to sit down?	Thanks.
You were talking in your sleep.	What'd I say?
He doesn't even look like that.	No?
Hello?  Yeah, she is.  Just a minute.  For you.	Hello?
You gonna go get him?	It's possible.  Why?
You here all by yourself?	That's right, just me.
Now listen, it's hands off Billy.  I mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours.	He was that good?
I wish she could forget him.	You don't forget love, Honey.  Not ever.
How could you do this?	The Colonel helped me work it out.
Didn't you say you told her not to come?	Yeah.
Sorry.	Why be sorry?  That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it.
Get me into a plane!	Come on!
You hear my okay?	Yeah.  So you can call me if you need help.
So beautiful!	Hang on.
I heard what you did.	We can explain, Colonel.
Hello, Lieutenant.  Good to see you.	You too, Lieutenant.
Oh, this is Betty.	Nice to meet you, Betty.
Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good, is it.  Or it wouldn't be so hard to say.	The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it.  But I've got to because it's true.  I love you.  That must surprise you.
There's one thing I have to say.  I'm going away.	We're all going away.
I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change.	Why are you so nervous? What is the matter with you today?
The only one?	Well, besides Charlie, of course.
They're waiting. Come on.	I can't. It's all too much.
We're going to take you home.	That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember the way.
I'll call you Later.	Yes. Let's stay in touch.
He is kind of cute, isn't he?	Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
But you love me don't you?	Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
How do you feel?	Pretty strange.
Want me to drive you home later?	Would you?
Looking good out there.	Thanks.
I'm sorry Charlie.	Save it.
Does this mean you like me again?	It means I care about you and what happens to you.
Let me got! Where are you taking me?	Right here. Now sit down.
I love you.	I know.
It couldn't be me.  I hardly knew him.	I'll just set it right here.
Did you study for the test?	Test?
I thought I knew everything about him.	Can we split now?
Young lady, you're drunk!	Just a little. I've had a tough day.
Damn that Charlie I	It's not Charlie. It's me.
For me?	Open it.
Jack, I was just trying to help.	We'll make it, we'll be fine.
My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast.	Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young.
What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up?	Oh. I forgot.
Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him?	What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.
Would you get that, dear?	Sure, Mom.  Hello.
What are you doing?	I'm just happy to see you.
Richard! They don't have any! They never heard of them! Isn't that wonderful?	What are you talking about?
Hi, Richard.	What are you doing?
What's the matter?	It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
What's a lunch cost these days? You want ten?	Sure.
What?	You alright?
Hey! Where're you off to?	I'm going out, Dad!
All set?	All set.
So where're we going?	Anywhere but here.
You think my Dad'll figure out why he's not getting better?	You think he'd believe it if he did?
You ever think about running away?	All the time.
How long have you been here?	Couple minutes. I saw the last shot. That was pretty cool.
I know, Mom.	You know everything, don't you?
Jesus.	I don't know what to do, Bob.
Do you really think so, Andy?	Yes, Bob, I do.  Excuse me? Am I being fired?
Thanks, you guys.	Yeah. Thanks, guys.
What's wrong with you?	Close the law book.
Thanks for coming in.	Of course.
I know that, Charles.	More than your friend. Family.
New baby?	One week old.
Who'd you get?	What?
I'm a law suit.	Not bad.
Are you a good lawyer?	I'm an excellent lawyer.
Thanks for coming by.	You bet. We'll see you later.
Do you need a break?	No.
Hello?	Hi, Mom. It's me.
Andy. Before we begin, I'd just like to say: everyone in this room is your friend.	You're in trouble.
Good school. What year?	Second.
Don't you know this is exactly the kind of bullshit that makes people hate you guys?	Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try?  Asshole.
I'll see you in an hour, max.	Night, honey.
Yeah. But we took care of him.	How did you do that?
Tell me that was you.	Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
Back to the ship, huh?	Get out of our way.
How many you see?	One or two.
Just come with me!	Got a better idea. Come with me.
They're already dead. Get on board.	You're fuckin' with me. I know you are.
You'd die for them?	I would try for them.
Christ, you don't know what's out there!	I know what's in here!
Hey.	Hey, who?
And him?	Big Evil?
So now you know.	Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than I thought.
Sorry. Thought I heard something.	Like what?
You said we were going to trust him now. You said there was a deal.	That's what I said.
One is all?	For now.
They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them.	And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
You'd cut me loose, Boss?	Only if we both get outta this alive. And there may be a way.
Are you fuckin' kidding me?	Not afraid of the dark, are you?
Fuck me. You said "clear."	Said "looks clear."
What's her name, anyway?	What do you care?
Take it.	What, it's broken?
Yes. I have to agree. From all you've found so far, his position's as good as yours.	What are you doing there?
Do you have to work tonight?	No.
Where there's one there's another. And another. And another.	Let's find them all.
Which one was wearing the strange clothes?	Him.
Gone.	We're here to stay.
If only we could get a fix.	What would you learn? I've told you where you are and when you are.
Okay. You read me well enough. Why can't I read you?	Don't bother
Shouldn't we be moving on?	I'm for that.
I told you not to bring the other one.	He wouldn't leave her.
Are you going to take her with you?	Yes.
Would you like to come along?	We can't.
So what's the problem?	Says he can't walk.
Come on man!	No!
First time?	Yeah.
Feel good?	Yeah. No pain in my neck now. Feels good.
You could tell me your name. And where you're going.	How far does this train go?
I think I'd like to dance.	Why certainly, baby.
I think you're drunk.	Just drunk enough.
You can have the table yourself, if you'd rather. I'm only killing time.	No, please.
Dance?	No thank you.
They'll know whether he killed himself.	I don't.
You tried to run away.	There wasn't any plane.
Bad?	Bad enough.
Cold?	Is this the best you can do?
Want to dance?	Dance? Here?
That's the second round I've lost tonight.  That fellow hurt me.	So have I.
Well?	You leave it.
In a way.	If it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
Please answer my question.	You didn't ask a question. You made a speech.
What this?	Yes.
You won't tell me who you are? You won't even give me a chance to help you?	Nobody can help me. You, least of all.
This isn't a very good place to talk.	I don't want to talk.
You've got a couple of hours, maybe.	To do what?
What?	A private joke.
Thank you.	Yes, I've seen it before.
Could be.	I rather thought so. And before that, had you ever seen the gun?
How about a cup of coffee?	No thanks. I had some. How would you like to take a walk for, say, half and hour?
I had a father who knew how to steal.	What?
What's the matter, baby. Don't you like me anymore?	Lay off, can't you?
What are you doing here?	I don't think you locked your door.
May you what?	Oh nothing.
What about me?	Not quiet yet.
No.	I hear she's a very pretty girl.
Get out of here!	What are my orders, sir?
I seem to remember that you like to help yourself.	That's not very kind.
What's this?	What does it look like?
She is beautiful. And young.  No thank you.	I say YES!
Shall we go?	Yes.
How's Mary?	She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.
Damn.  They're early.	Who?
Again?	Yes, if you like.  Call me at work.
Why not stay?	I have to be up early. 
You don't trust me.	I don't trust anyone.  That's what comes of working in television.
Look, will you come on a walk with me tomorrow?	I might.
Might?	Yes.  Might.  Remember, you're here to talk to my mother.
We don't seem to get much time to talk.	I know.  I'm sorry.
Now, top secret file.	Come on.  Hand over.
Uh-huh.  Tell me what you think of this first.	It's shit.
That's enough of that.	We've been playing ten minutes for Christ sake.
Still in love?	I'm not sure.
Hello.	Hello.
Hello, Jimmy.	Dad.
I've got to be going.  I've got a meeting tonight.	The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
We'll see what we can do.	Promise?
Don't close the door.  Don't turn out the hall light.	I won't.  Goodnight.
Don't you want to walk, Tom?	No.
Gonna be some people at my house tonight.  Maybe you can make it.	Where?
I gotta be fucking crazy.	Yeah, but are you crazy enough?
Ever done this before?	Once.
Go on, Johnny.  Pull it.  But you gotta drop the gun, first!  Right?! You use your other hand what you gonna hold on with?	Pull it right now or I'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!
You know less than nothing.  If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't.	Yes, sir.
How was the beach?	Fine.
No, but there are four guys back there you might check out.	Thanks, buddy.
The hell are they?!	They took a left at the next light!
Nothing?	Nothing.
I know where they're going.	Figured you did.
Stop here.  Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it?	Sure.
Who's the girl?	Catch of the day.
You had enough?	Yeah.  I just want to sit out here for a minute.
Look at you.	What?
Those are cold.	Warm them up.
What the hell do you think you're doing?	We're going to need everyone.
I'll see you there.	Right behind you.
You saw what?	I saw it.
Your uncle will like this.	He's not really my uncle.
You don't know anything about me.	I'd like to find out.  You don't know anything about me either. That's why people have lunch.
Congratulations, sir.	What?
Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?	What's that?
Nice car.  Yours?	No.
Three hundred.	Fine.
Get in.  This side.	What?
Let's talk some more first.	Right.  So!  In town on business?
What do you like?	If I want you to turn me on I'll pay you three hundred.  Just lay back and let me drive.
Good morning.	You didn't wake me.  I'll be out of here in a minute.
Did you sleep well?	Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
All right.  How much for the week?	What?
It'd cost you.	Of course.  How much?
Hello?	I thought I told you not to answer the phone.
You're upset, huh?	Upset.  No.  I never get upset about business.
I still don't understand why you only bought one dress.	I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
Okay.	Good.
I thought maybe you'd like dinner.	Thank you.  I would.  Nice.
What about dinner?	Dinner can wait.
You always been rich?	No.
You still mad at'm?	He died a long time ago.
I've never been on a plane before.	I'm glad you like it.  Now be quiet, I've really got to read these.
One more night and you're finally rid of me.	Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.
What else?  You gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town?	It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
What did you do to him?	What do you mean?
What's up, where you going?	Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.
Love this car!  Is it new?	Yes!  And you don't even know where you're going!
Did I wake you?	I'm up.
What!?	Have a good day, gentlemen.
You broke my nose.	I think I broke my hand.  You're fired.
Yes, I'm glad you're clean but I've been calling and calling.	Was that you?
You sure you won't come with me?	And leave all this?  Not in a million.
May I help you?	I'm just looking, thanks.
You have beautiful things.  How much is this?	I don't think it would fit you.
What is with you?	Excuse me?
Yes?	Do you remember me?
He will come for me.	Of course.
I killed him myself.	Then why is there fear behind your eyes?
Does it bother you to hear?	Nothing you can say will upset me.
I fear I'll never see you again.	Of course you will.
Can you move at all?	Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
But it did. I was there. This old man said, "Man and wife."	Did you say, "I do"?
You're quick.	And a good thing too.
Faster!	I thought I was going faster.
Hello.	It's you.
You don't look so good.  You don't smell so good either.	Perhaps not. I feel fine.
Will this do?	Where did you get that?
I brought you a special present.	What is it?
A book?	That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.
Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned. But that's not the same thing.	Because I can stop now if you want.
Now I think you ought to go to sleep.	Okay.
Now?	Not yet.
Now?	Light him.
You don't know any way you'll trust me?	Nothing comes to mind.
We'll wait until you're ready.	Again. Thank you.
Because I know something you don't know.	And what is that?
You're amazing!	I ought to be after twenty years.
There's something I ought to tell you.	Tell me.
You feeling any better?	A little bit.
Help!	All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it.
Yes, what?	What you were saying.  Keep talking.
Will you get a hold on yourself.	Don't touch me!  Don't touch me!
Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that better?	It's a little better, but you still look angry.
Where would you like to eat?	Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What do you think, Max?
It won't run a week!	Run a week?  Are you kidding?  This play has got to close in the first act.
Maybe it's not true!	No way out.  No way out.
Do you need us?	Of course I need you.  It's dark in there.
We make love?	No!  No!  We don't make love.  Go to work.
Of course, the check, I had it with me all the time.	I don't know what's happening to me. I must be getting old.
Let's all talk about Mary.	Who are you, friend?
What's your interest?	Money.
Why?	Must've needed it.
Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!	Now. Your sister is missing how long?
Yes.	She ain't missing so much as she's run away.
She stole some money.	A lot?
Did he say anything about my sister?	Just what he told your detective.
Yes?	May I talk to you?
Is something wrong?	I want to know if my sister is here.
What should I know?	To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
What thing?	Huh?
Probably on his way back right now.	Sam, I'm going.
Stay here.	Why can't I go out there with you?
He didn't come back here?	Sam.
I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.	Of course we will.
Sorry.	Hospital clean.
You can't go up there.	Why not?
You have something most girls never have.	I have?
You eat like a bird.	You'd know, of course.
Wait a minute!	Now what?
Went out before service.	Have you two had breakfast?
I've been doing all the talking so far, haven't I?	Yes.
My mother is not dead!	I didn't think so.
Yes.	From what?
What are you going to do?	I'm going to call the police.
You are right. But before I can get him back here, you will have to help me.	How? What can I do?
What is it now?	I'm losing my blood!
Your father?	Yes!
The child!	Yes.
There's no child here, and no dogs either.	No?
You wouldn't have said that before you met her.	I'd call it stupid at any time.
Which one is me? The horse?	Get out of here.
You didn't happen to be going to Worth's place, did you?	No, sir, I'm sure it wasn't there.
Why?	You go in for dangerous things.
What is it? What happened?	Don't ask any questions. Come on!
Two: what if I didn't miss?	You did.
What was her name?	Excuse me???
What?	I could go out of town.
Could you?	Where to?
I didn't want to leave things the way we did.  Not this time.	Wait.  I want to tell you something.
Why?	So I can move on.  You too.
Yes?	Is Rose here?
Buddy, you wouldn't tell nobody, would you?	Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul.
Hi, Buddy.  How's my sweetheart who never told on me when I was bad?	Okay.
You were up late last night, Brother.	Well, a little.
Son, was Rose in your room last night?	No. Why should Rose be in my room?
I never saw anything like it. How did she pick him up so fast?	I don't know.
Is that Doctor still up there, Brother.	Yeah, he's still up there.
Open that door, damn you!	Daddy, what's the matter?
I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose come in?	No, she hasn't.  I think I hear a car.
There goes Mother.	Yeah.
I think she's gonna kiss him.	At least.
Now I can't see. What are they doing?	Boy! Wow!
What's goin' on?	Rose says she's goin' to have a baby and she sure looks it, but I don't think so.
Why is it taking so long?	Here comes Daddy.
Why Rose? Why Rose, Daddy?	Nobody lives forever, boy. Who'd want to?
Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful day.	Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
Well, she's back.	What time is it?
How is she?	Fine.
Rose, what are you doing up?	Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
Nothin'. I got myself up, that's all.	Got yourself up?
You were up late last night, too, Rose.	Yes, sir. I had to go to the bathroom.
I got an awful bad cold.	That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?
And who, Rose, may I ask, is that?	Well, it's Billy.
Well, Rose, going out to look for a job today?	What's the use, there ain't none.
Yes, I am.	No, you're not.
You see, Rose? Now that's the kind of dress you ought to wear.	Yeah, it's kinda nice.
Rose, you don't have to.	I don't mind.
I can work this.	No you can't.
This is too fast.  This is way too fast!	Relax.
How you doing back there?	Feeling great.
He tried to kill us.	We've got the tape to prove it.
Alright?	Absolutely.
We got him.	Slow down.
You get him?	Dead.
Been waiting long?	Just got here.
Get his attention.	Your wish is my command.
You see that?	Yeah.
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.	It'll work. It'll work.
Shall we try and go around?	It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
What's going on?	I don't know.
I'm sorry.	Hold me.
Yes.	All right. I understand. Fine. When he comes back, I won't get in the way.
Good luck.	You, too.
Here we go again.	All right, hang on.
We're coming!	Come on! Come on!
I'm going in.	Here goes nothing.
He's my father.	Your father?
Told you, did he?	Yes.
You!	I'm afraid so, Brad.  But wasn't it nice?
Yes Brad.	I've got something to say.
Right!	We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.
Good God.	Yes.
Promise you won't tell Brad.	Cross my heart and hope to die.
What a guy	Makes you cry
What guy	Makes you cry
On the day I went away.	Goodbye
I think you had better both come inside.	You're too kind.
I thought you liked them.  They liked you.	They didn't like me.  They never liked me.
But you never had a chance to prove yourself.	Absolutely.
What's the matter? Ya don't like the room?	It's fine.
My side.	Get that doctor.
I don't like ya face.	Don't like yours neither.
What's ya name again?	Bob.
A hundred an' thirty.	That's it, I'm broke.

Really think so?	Ya got heart.

Ya nose is broke.	Damn! How's it look?
Wanna keep goin'?	Would you keep goin'?

They must've taken it off me.	They?
You?	That's right, me.
Hold on a second.	Eddie, come on.
You got the will in there, don't ya?	No, I don't.
What the hell are you doin'?	I needed a place to hide.  I'm in trouble, Eddie.
Does this help?	Yeah, that's better.
I'll get it.	Get away from there.
Wrong number?	No, it's not.
It's under your seat.	What?
So what's the deal?	The deal?  The deal is we leave for Nice at first light.
Problem my ass!  I think you're lying to me, and if you are you're a dead man!	Would somebody tell me what fucking well happened in there?
Lose them!	You lose them!
Do you have it?	Not so fast.  Who's that?
We'll die if we stay here!	You'll die if you leave here.
This better be the real thing or you're a dead man!	It is, I'm telling you it is!!
Is it done?	It's done.
He's tough, your American friend.	Yes, Sam's tough alright.
Some, thanks.  Enough to move on, for now.	You should really let a doctor look at that.
You shoot alright.	Gets the job done.
What are you gonna do, call him up and ask him to give us back our shit?	Did he bring that with him?
Where to?	To see a man about a thing.
Pretty much what you'd expect.	That's what I thought.
What'd you say to him?	I asked if we could give him anything else.
Lovely, isn't it?	They'd have to keep something like this under lock and key in New York, and it would still get fucked up.
What's going on?	I just wanted to see something.
How did you know?	Know what?
It was at that.	A lot of people died.
You know him?	I know of him.
Tell me, Sam: why do you do this?	Do what?
I'm not here very much.	Business keeps you on the road?
I know I don't need to say this to you, but I need to say it to you.  This is my job, I have to do it.	So I do it.
Time to quit.	Just like that?
Why didn't you kill her?	Why didn't you kill him?
My man, how you doing?	I'm alright.  And you?
Do you have the tape?	I might know where you could get a copy.
Ten thousand right here.	There must be over a million dollars in here.
What are we going to do?	What do you mean what are we going to do?
Call it in I guess.  Why?	Why?  Are you kidding me?
No.  We can't.	Look around you partner!  You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
It won't work.	Why?
I don't know!  Son of a bitch! Who the hell are you?	He saw everything!
I could kill that no good son of a bitch!	All right enough!  I'm tired of thinking about all this!
You said that last time!	Well I mean it this time.  Come on.  Let's get this over with!
How long is it going to take?!	I don't know!  Shit, give me a break!
I was beginning to think you weren't going to show.  That can't be all of it.	No.  It's not.
You don't expect us to believe that do you?	You better believe it if you know what's good for you!
How are ya?	Hello.
Well, we have one lead and that's what I'm looking into next.	What's that?
Ah hell, he'd do the same for me.	Has he?
Hi.	Hi.
What's wrong?	Nothing.
Let's not get into this again. I know him.  If you said something, he'd take it out on me.	And I'd take it out on him.
How are we going to do all this?	I'm going to quit.  That's what has to happen first.  Then we're going to tell him.
Do you wanna tell me what that was all about?	Yeah.  I want to tell you everything.
Yeah, I've seen him.	What did he buy?
I have a better plan.  You want to hear it?	What?
And what's that?	How about you give us what you have and leave.
I guess we can get started.	I wanted to ask you some questions about last night.
Maybe.  Maybe not.	What are you getting at?
Hello.	Hi.
Aw, now that gonna take time to clear!	Take it or leave it.
Nice of you to join us.  I did say three o'clock, didn't I?	Well I'm here now.
Don't you want to hear about my day?	Yeah let's hear about your day.
We're out of here.	Right behind you.
I'm not asking.	Well you're not getting, either.
Hi ma.	Hi.
This whole place?	Yeah.  Figured you could have it.
Don't you want it?	Ah, hell I'll get one soon enough.  Besides, I want you to have it.
You want to hear the good news first, or the bad news?	Give me the bad news.
He didn't make it into work, and he's not home.	I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!
Yeah.	What do you think?  Heart attack?
I'm busy at the moment.	I said get on your feet!
Would you like me to tell you how your father died?	Lee, you okay?
Do you have it in you, Lee?  Or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?	C'mon, Lee.  He's going to jail.  You won, now just put the gun down.
Oh, you American?	That's right.
Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that one.	Oh yes, she's very nice.
Hello.	How you doin'?
What are you doing?	She said I could pick any girl I want.
Goddamn you got a small ass.	Don't look at my ass!
So are you getting on the plane or not?!	What?
Slow down, baby.	What did you say?
Pick it up!	It's your turn!
Wait!  There's people down there!	There's people up here!
I wouldn't do that!!!	It's a bomb.
Why didn't you tell me you had a bomb in your mouth?	I did!
Lee, wait a second.  It's not worth it, man.  He's making you do this.	It's worth it to me.
We made it, man.	No problem.
They owe us, man.  That's the least they can do.	This money is evidence.
What's going on?	I need your help.
You move well.	Just trying to make it look real.
Are you okay?	I'm fine.
I didn't know which side you were on.	Now you know.
If you reach for that gun, I'm going to kill you.	Don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
You have one of these?	No.
You speak English!	A little.
You talk too fast.	Come on!
Let's go.  Everybody take off?	Took off. Yes. They took off.
You like it?	Yeah, it's good.
That's not how it goes.	Yes, I think so.
What?!	It's him.
Like that.	I am sorry, but I have too much respect for women.
No, wait.  I don't have it.  You have it.	Oh yes.
I'm sorry, Lee.	Be sorry for Soon Young. She has no chance now.
Oh no.	What?
Not anymore.	Where'd you get it?
How'd what go?	With the FBI. What do you think I'm talking about?
You OK?	We saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?
My daughter.	She's fine.
Yes.	You have what I asked for?
When were you going to tell me you were not going with us?	I still have work to do here.
Yes.	Let me take you back inside, okay?
You look awful.	Thank you.
Is that what I did to you?  Is that what happened?  Did I just not see you?	No.  No, you didn't.
Of course we are.  Of course.	Then you'll be my best man.
I think you'd look good in red.	No, she's talking about your hair.
Weird dreams?  You're going to tell me about them?	Yes.
I don't know.	You don't know.
I'll have the same.	Of course.
I don't know, give me a minute.  Are you all right with this?	Excuse me?
I love you.  I love you.	I love you, too.
To who?  Are you asking me?	Me?
Yes, you!	Well, you do have the dress.
I'm going to kill myself.	Why?
What?	Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
They loved you.  I told you they would love you and they did.	I love you.
Happy New Year, darling.	Happy New Year.
Walter.	It was my mother's.
Oh!	What?
You should write something about this.	About what?
What was that about up there?	What was what?
Men never get this movie.	I know.
Hello.	Turn on your radio!
Did you talk to him?	I couldn't do it.  How did I get here?
You told a lie and got on a plane.	That's not what I mean.  I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him.  I am.
You're going to miss the train.	No, I'm not. 
Honey, he wasn't right for you.	I know.
So you'll get married in a new dress.	It's a sign.
Hello.	Hello.
It's you.	It's me?
I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'm not mad at you.	I think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this. Maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better.
Do you think there's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife? Maybe even more?	It's hard to imagine.
What are you going to do, Sam?	I don't know.  When I met my wife, it was so clear.  I just knew.
You don't like the one he was now?	He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
No.	Why not?
Is he home right now?	Yeah.
Write her.	You think so?
This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life.	I don't get it.
Dad?  About last night?	It's never happening again. Right?
Fine.  Fine.	So I can go.
How did they get our phone number?	You have to give them your phone number or they won't let you go on the air.
If you get a new wife, I guess you'll have sex with her, huh?	What do you think?
Did you call that radio station again?	No.
What if I couldn't get to you?	I was scared of what you were gonna do.
Maybe we'll get a dog when we get back.	Okay.
Hi.	Hi.  Sam?
Hi.	Hi.
You look good.	You look good yourself.
I thought you were never going to call me.	You did?
He's ten.	He's good at it.
Take a drink. Calm down!	I say we gotta take action. Now.
Where you going?	Got to talk to the brothers.
This water's cold again.	I'm sorry. The fire's gone out.
What were they saying? About you? In there?	They say I am no good to you.
Let them take it!	Over my dead body.
You all right?	Sure.
Must've been some experience for you, huh?	Yes.
How do you feel?	I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
We've got to have a talk, you and me.	All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
Tell me.	We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.
This is what we've been waiting for.	What are you saying?
No, I don't mind.  That's how come I told you about it.	I was talking to my wife.
I wanna do a small buy first.  Ten thousand.  We'll see how it goes.	Why? The guys is ready to deal now.
Yeah.	Everything go?
What?	Nothing.
Why don't you call the cops?	Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
Then make sure he gets put away for longer.	How?
Oh. Hi.	What happened to your eye?
Is that how you play?	I try.
: What are you up to?	Nothing.
You think you're the only one down here with a sad story?	No. But I'm the only one with my sad story.  And that's how it's gonna stay.
Who is it?	It's me.
Why not?	I just can't. Okay?
No. I want to know what the hell is going on.	I can't tell you.
No, you're wrong, I tried to tell myself the same thing but I could have gotten up. I could have done something.	They would have killed you too.
Really, I don't want to.	I want to do this for you.  I want to do something good for a change.
Will you do that?  Then I want you to get out of the room.	Why?
Oh shit	What?
Who is it?	It's Tom.
What time is it?	Twelve
Where to?	I know a guy.
You know, Jimmy, you might as well put a sign on the back of this thing asking the cops to pull you over.	You mean, like to throw 'em off?
You want a hit?	No. I'm good.
Can I ask you something?	Sure, Jimmy.
Okay	Wait till I tell you what it is.
Why?	You're my best friend, man. I'd do anything for you.
Then why don't I see any pictures Of me up there?	That was my idea.
You don't understand.	Understand what?
I'm sorry.  Would you like a taste?	No, I'm good.
Can we talk price?	Make me an offer.
You're serious?	Anything for a dear friend.
Shoot him.	Okay! Okay!
Now get talkin'	I didn't fucking do anything! I swear to God!
CAN I PULL MY FUCKING DICK OUT?!	Yeah.
I've got a hot one.	You go, boy.
I was getting to it.	Tell me what?
What the hell are you doing here?	Question is, what are you doing here?
We know what's going on.	I still don't know what you're talking about.
Jimmy?	Who the hell is Jimmy?
What's that smell?	That would be me.
You think that's a good idea?	What do you mean?
You thinking what I'm thinking?	Yeah.  This could be the one we're looking for.
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.	Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
Good luck, John.	Thank you, sir.
Yes, sir.	Of course, sir.
Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.	I'd love to hear it.
Not yet.	Keep trying.
I wasn't made for this.	You think the rest of us were?
What is it?	A machine gun.
Good luck, Captain.	Don't need it, I'm a cat, I've got five lives.
I wonder where they're going.	Same place we are.
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.	You don't count.
Captain, what about our deal?	I changed my mind.
CAPTAIN, IF YOUR MOTHER SAW YOU DO THAT, SHE'D BE VERY UPSET!	I THOUGHT YOU WERE MY MOTHER.
I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.	Now you're the one kidding yourself.  Hell of  a mission.
Makes you feel small, doesn't it?	It doesn't take this.
Sir, I've got an idea, let's go around.	We can't leave it here.
Up.  We're moving out.	I thought you said we had an hour, sir?
I've given this a lot of thought, sir.  The best thing that could happen is, we find Ryan and he's dead.	Why's that?
Looks like they've been having a hell of a party, here, Captain.	ON THE BRIDGE!  WE'RE COMING IN.
I HAVE NO FUCKING IDEA.  HERE WE COME.  Cover me.	What if our guys open up, sir?
Thank you, sir.	Yeah, yeah.  I want you right next to me, no matter where I go, you understand?
Yes, sir.	Alright, come with me.
Damn fool.  Sir.	Captain, he's fast!
So, where are you from?	Get lost.
Hi.	Is it a gift for your wife?  Are you getting a set together? 
Thanks, I like yours too.	Listen, I don't know your name, but what are you doing for lunch?
I'm sorry, but they turned down your card.	Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
Keep it.	You're sure?
No, no, don't go in there.	Forget it, forget it, it's mine, it's mine!
Then what's love?	I'm gonna call her.
Wait for me for when I get round to the front. 	Okay, I got it.
Did you sleep with her?	I admit nothing.
What does it say?	Read it.
No, you're not a guy.	I am.
I told him to be himself.	He's got that nervous talking thing.  I told him not to speak.
Visit her at the home.	I'm not going back there.  I don't even know who you're talking about.
What?	I just had a phone call.
God, I'll have to go on a plane.	We'll worry about that later.  Now come on, tell me that you're special.
Morning honey.	Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
Goodnight.	Goodnight.
Morning.	Dad, I'm sorry.
Dad, maybe I shouldn't go with all that's happening to you.	You're going.
Do you love him?	I like him a lot.
If I pick it up, we'll only get back together.	Well then don't pick it up. You know what's best.
What happened to you?	Dad, did you do it?  Did you take that money?
Hello.	Hi.
So we can finally talk?	Yeah.
Have a good sleep.	Bye.
It's just you and your dad, right?	Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.
Yeah.	Or, or I could always wear this one.
Nice one.	Yeah?
After work?	I usually have a break after the dinner service, if you want to stop by.
Stop by later.	Okay, bye, I will.
Yes.	What did you say?
Let's get outta here.  You want to?	Yeah.
What do you want?	I'm sorry.
How's it going?	Nobody thought we'd do this.  Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
Okay, I'll give here the message.	Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?
My car.	Your car?
Oh boy.	Hey.
I love you man	I love you too.
What's your name?	Sir, the list is correct.
Luck.	War.
Should I stay?	It's a beautiful city.
Should I stay?	It's up to you.
We started without you.	Good.
I go to work the other day, there's nobody there.  Nobody tells me about this, I have to find out, I have to go in, everybody's gone -	They're not gone, they're here.
I tried to call you, I'm running a little late, this is taking longer than I thought.  Have a drink.	What's going on?
You want these people.	These people, my people, I want my people.
If you admit to making three, then it's four, actually.  But how?	I just told you.
How you feeling, all right?	Yeah.
What's wrong with it?	How should I know?  It's broken. See what you can do.
Good.  How's it going?	Things are great, things are great.
What are you doing?	I'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
Thank you.	I need a drink.
I don't know anybody who'd be interested in that.	They should be.
I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's till hot.  We're doing well?	Yes.
Don't ever do that to me again.	Do what?
You think I don't know what you're doing? You're so quiet all the time?  I know.	Are you losing money?
I'll talk to him.	I think it's too late.
Four hundred, four fifty -	More.
I know what you're saying, but I don't see the difference.	You don't?  I do.  I see a difference.
I'll talk to you later.	No, no, what, what is it?
What's he done that's so bad - take money? That's a crime?  Come on, what are we here for, to fight a war?  We're here to make money, all of us.	There's taking money and there's taking money, you know that.  He's taking money.
That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there.	I won't.
Shit.	What is it?
Outside.	That's smart.
Yes.	Who is this?
Oh, I'm sorry. My bad.  I thought you were someone else.	That's okay.
Hello? Ted?	No, it's me.
Jesus, you scared me. What are you doing here?	I live here.
I just thought if I saw you face to face, maybe it would help.	Did it?
What are you going to do?	Finish what my son started.
This is exactly what I don't want.	I think it's out of your control.
Not good. How you doin?	Not good.
You broke my heart.	What are we looking for?
Maybe they never got here. He could have taken her anywhere.	C'mon. Let's go.
Let's go.	No, wait here.
Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll find you later, okay.	Whatever.
Who is this?	I'll give you one guess.
Who are you?	That's not the way we play the game.
What do you want?	You're pretty when you're angry.
What do you want from me?	It's what you want from me.
What do you mean?	You are writing another book, aren't you? That's why you're here. The story's not over.
What?	Oh my God.
Someone trying to kill me. I need the police.	Are you in danger now?
I got a surprise for you.	What?
You're going to get it. You know what happens.	But I love you. And I want the whole world to know it.
Knock yourself out.	Hello?  Hello?
That was good.	Yeah, right.
I've been waiting for you, baby.	Is that cool? Just to leave her like that?
And white.	Easy black boy.
You ass.	I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.
I'll be right back.	Where you going?
Jesus.  Hello?	Hello.
Well what number are you trying to reach?	I don't know.
Listen you sick fuck, is this your idea of a joke?	More of a game really.
Are you sure?	Absolutely.
I can see nothing's changed.	No.
Yeah?	Help me Sid! The killer's got me!
Would you excuse me for a moment?	Sure.
I didn't kill anybody.	No one's saying you did.
You ready to party hard tonight?	You know it.
It's on the table.	No, it's not.
I thought she was dead.	She looked dead. Still does.
Close call.	What are you doing here?
Jesus, SHIT!	Hey, hey, it's just me.
You heard me.	Are you serious?
Who did you call?	What?
NO! Don't believe him.	It's okay. Give me the gun.
It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!	Fuck you.
Hello?	Are you alone in the house?
Yes.	Who is this?
What?	I want to talk to you for a second.
Hello.	Why don't you want to talk to me?
I don't know.	You have to have a favorite.
Why do you want to know my name?	Because I want to know who I'm looking at.
What did you say?	I want to now who I'm talking to.
Yes?	I told you not to hang up on me.
Is this some kind of a joke?	More of a game, really.
I'm two seconds from calling the police.	They'd never make it in time.
Look, enough is enough. You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else.	Or else what?
Where are you?	Guess.
What kind of game?	Turn off the light.
What's his name?	I can't think.
What door am I at?	What?
And why is that? Has something happened?	You're not supposed to be here, ma'am.
If you'll excuse me, ma'am.	Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
What are you doing here?	Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
What is she doing here?	She's with me. I just wanted to check on things.
You girls ready.	Yeah.
Have they found my father?	Afraid not.
Where is she?	Call the police.
Where is she?	I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her.
How's the book?	It'll be out later this year.
I'll look for it.	I'll send you a copy.
I'm not here to fight.	Just stay back.
Please. You owe me.	I owe you shit.
So where are you?	Right here.
Can you see me right now?	Uh-huh.
Are you okay?	Can you knock?
Stop. Right there.	Don't shoot. It's me.
Come on, Sid. Give me the gun.	No, Sid.
Why are they doing this?	Are you kidding? This is like Christmas.
Do you believe this shit?	What happened?
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.	Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
Take a message.	It's alright. I'll get it.
Just relax. You're at school now. No one can get you here.	But if it wasn't Billy it could be anybody. He could be here at school right now.
This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.	I want you to meet me here right after class, okay?
You don't.  It goes to court now.	He wouldn't just turn himself in.  It doesn't make any sense.
What do you think?	I'm in.
Have you heard?	No, I haven't heard.
Jesus Christ, man, don't shoot me!	Turn around.  Hands on your head!
This guy paid me five hundred bucks to bring it out here.  He wanted it here at exactly seven o'clock.	Put it down.  Put it on the ground.
I don't believe it.	Hello.
What do you mean?	I mean, at this point, what would it hurt if you told us a little about yourself?
What time is it?	Why?
Give me the gun.	Her pretty head.
You didn't know.	NO!
I wish I could have been a normal man like you.  I wish I could have a simple life.	What the fuck is going on here?!
Here he comes.	What the fuck is going on?
Who said this was murder?	No one yet.
It's too soon for him.	Can we talk about this in private?
It's my wife.	What?
You go to movies at least?	I read.  Remember reading?
This is the one thing.	I know.
Nothing.	It's got to be.
Oh, yeah, sure.  You got to be kidding?!	Just wait!
He just may be nuts enough.	It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop.
Does this make it with you?	Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
Well, that was money well spent.	Let's go.
Are you alright?	I'm fine.
What are you talking about?	We had him.
We could use about fifty more men here.	I'm trying, alright?  Just tell me what we've got.
You knew I'd say yes.	No, actually, I wasn't sure at all.
As soon as this is over, I'm gone.	Big surprise.
Stay with him.	Wait!
Throw your gun down now!	What are you talking about?  What happened?
Don't worry.  I don't wear it at the dinner table.	No matter how often I see guns, I still can't get used to them.
How long have you lived here?	Too long.  What do you think so far?
I mean, you known this city.  You've been here for so long.	It's a hard place.
Did their son see it happen?	I don't know.
Don't forget to come back with my thousand dollars.	Ain't yours yet.
What's that got to do with us?	What's goin' on?
Stop that!	You'll never get away from me!
Is everything alright?  Aren't you feeling well?	I just had a really strange experience.
I have a funny feeling.  Do you think we'll get over all that's happened?	We just have to make a new beginning.
It's just a feeling.  Don't you sense it, too?	What? What am I supposed to sense?
What?	Look at this!  The dog!  She's dead!
How did you get me out of there?	I wouldn't have made it by myself.
For God's sake, what happened to me?	You don't remember?
You didn't tell her!	We should leave the past alone.
Thank you, my lady!	Lady?
Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome.	Who is that?
I have a wonderful new play!	Put his feet in.
Where is the play?	Oh, it's coming, it's coming.
Is it going well?	Very well.
Do you know it?	Every word.
Cut round him for now.	What? Who?
We are lost.	No, it will turn out well.
Another little problem.	What do we do now?
"Out."	"Of love?"
Be good to her, my lord!	I will.
Your Majesty.	Stand up straight, girl.
My lady!	Who is there?
Oh my lady, my love!	If they find you here they will kill you.
I would not have thought it. There is something better than a play.	There is.
Oh, do not go	I must. I must
You cannot! Not for the Queen herself!	What will you have me do? Marry you instead?
Yes, sir.	Do you understand me?
Is there a man?	A man, my lord?
What do you think?	About what?
He made it clear.	Why, thank you, David.
No.	Think about it.
He's still here.	He couldn't get his car started.
Finished.	But not quite.
That was good.	Can we talk about something?
What's the problem?	I want to talk now.
How much did you pay?	I don't know.
What is this?	Security.
What? Yes, that's fine.	You're sure? There's lots more.
You looking for me?	Looking for you? Yes.
Who?	Your friends.
Well, is it?	What?
That's it, then.	That's all?
Right.	Tell you what. If you do remember seeing any of these guys, maybe you could give me a phone, on this number, any time you like.
That's right.	What?
What?	Nothing. We thought you were someone else.
I'm not usually drunk.	Not usually this drunk.
I wonder how he did it?	Did what?
Who's going to do it?	I thought we all were.
Hello. Hello.	Who was it?
Will you calm down.	Yeah, you're making us all nervous.
Is this the same stuff you made last week?	No, no, it's different.
Leave him alone.	He can't stay up there.
Boy, am I glad to see you.	What are you doing here?
Expecting anyone?	No.
Aren't you going to answer it?	Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.
You'll wait in the hall?	I'll wait there.
Are you all right?	Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I be?
It makes us feel a whole lot better.	That's what I thought he said.
It's about me and David.	The perfect couple, I should say.
Interesting.	I see.
It's OK. There's no problem.	You mean I can have the room?
Two?	Who said there were four?
I see.	I doubt it. And these two other people, did they hear anything?
No, I've never seen them.	You're sure of that.
Why do you want a room here?	Do you smoke?
Is this what they always look like?	Yes.
Are you all right?	Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks, just fine.
Do you know many of these people?	Yes. They're my friends.
Expecting anyone?	What?
I thought you'd gone to work.	With a face like this?
I'm sorry.	I should hope so.
We already know. All about it.	It was on the television.
So let's go.	You and me?
Yes.	And you need your sleep.
But I bet you didn't say you were going to split on him.	It wasn't like that.
What do we do here, David?	Sorry?
Hello.	What happened to that guy?
What guy that died?	That one, last week.
It's nice.	Would you like to see the rest?
Take all the time you like, doctor.	I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
Your watch.	Is it real?
Anyway, you remember Harold?	Yeah, baby, how's it going?
We cannot go into this later.	That's okay too.
What're you looking for?	My keys.
Thanks a lot.	Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
You're late, George.	I gotta talk to you.
I don't care about that girl, I don't care if she's dead.	Calm down, baby.
I can see that.	You're looking great, baby.
Hi.	Hello, George.
Want me to?	Let it ring.
Well, is she your girlfriend?	No.
Shit.	Hello.
You here to see my mother?	Yeah.
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.	Why do you wanna know so bad?
Well, are you?	Am I what?
Yeah, it is.	I never get my hair done.
Right now?	Yeah.
George!	Yeah.
What!	Somebody's going to have to wash Mrs. Young. Mary's not here.
So how's Norman?	Great. Who's been doing your hair?
Shut up, it's all right.  Do you want a drink?	No, thanks.
Where do you want to do this?	Probably the bathroom.
No.	Why not?
Sit down.	What are you talking about?
That sounds like me.	I am you, you little bastard.
Yeah!	Wash her.
Hi, George.	Hey, baby, what's happening?
I've had these dumb dreams lately.	What?
I don't know. I can't remember. It was just in my dream.	No shit?
How are you, baby?	Fine. How are you?
Honey?	Yeah, baby.
Will we live together?	We live together now.
Maybe you don't even like children.	Of course I like children.
George.	Hey, baby, what's happening?
Great.	Could I talk to you for a second?
Yeah.	I said I wasn't sure if I could go.
What do you want?	Your advice!
When?	When I get off work.
What business meeting?	Look at the way I live.
How come you took your own car?	I didn't want him meeting me here.
You did fuck him, didn't you?	I'm very tired, George.
Didn't you, baby?	Let go of me.
That was him.	Yes.
Yes.	Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
Obviously.	How many?
I wish you'd go now.	That's all you've got to say?
It's good you want to do something, George.	Thank you.
When?	When?
I wish my son knew what he wanted to do.	Oh yeah?
I wanna hear about it.	Oh Jesus Christ.
Want a drink?	No thanks.
You don't have a clean glass in the house.	I know.
You really think so?	Yes I do.
What took you so long?	Wasn't sure it was you.
You're home.	Yeah.
Shut the door, shut the door!	Oh, I'm sorry.
I'd like a drink.	Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.
Here.	Aren't you going to have one?
Well, he is.	So what's your point?
Oh. thank you.	Sure.
George? Was he alone?	I don't think so.
What's wrong?	We can't really leave that poor man here alone.
Everything okay, son?	Terrific. Now all I have to do is find my car keys.
Dad?	Yes?
How's it going, Doc?	Okay.
Are you having a good time?	Yes, Dad.
No.  I'm just a little tired.	Then why don't you go to sleep?
Yes I do.  I love it.  Don't you?	I guess so.
Dad?	What?
Did your mother ever say that to you - that I would hurt you?	No, Dad.
Why don't you want to talk about it?	I'm not supposed to.
Yes.	How does he tell you things?
I don't know.	Now think real hard, Doc.  Think.
Maybe he showed me something.	Try to think what it was.
We'll get something as soon as we get to the hotel, okay?	Okay, Mom.
It's so pretty.	Yeah.
Mom?	Yes?
Well all right.  But really don't make a sound.	I won't, Mom.
Make sure you come right back, 'cause I'm going to make lunch soon. Okay?	Okay, Mom.
Mommy!	Oh!
Shall we go into the living room?	Yes.
Won't keep you a moment, sir.	Fine.
haven't I seen you somewhere before?	Why no, sir.  I don't believe so.
I'd be glad to do that, sir.  Oh why don't you call me back in about eh twenty minutes?	Thank you very much.  I'll do that.
No, we don't mind.	Good.
No charge?	Your money's no good here.
Perfect for a child.	Yeah.
Any ideas yet?	Lots of ideas.  No good ones.
and it will then take me time to get back to where I was, understand?	Yes.
Did you find anything?	No, nothing at all.
He's still asleep.	Good.
Somebody did that to him.	I think he did it to himself.
Get him out of here?	Yes.
Jack!	How do you like it?
Of course I am.	Of course you are.
Stay away from me!	Why?
Don't hurt me!  Don't hurt me!	I'm not going to hurt you.
Stay away from me!	I'm not going to hurt you.
JAck, just make yourself at home. Would you like some coffee?	Well, if you are going to have some, I wouldn't mind.  Thanks.
Well, obviously some people can be	put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
Hi.	Hi.
What time does the plane leave?	Eight thirty.
Can I tell you kids something?	Sure, Uncle Al.
Yes. Go away.	Let me help you up.
Marty? You okay? You've just been sitting here all morning.	Where's Mom?
Please, Uncle Al.	Will you?
You all right, Marty?	Yeah.
You gave me a heart attack, Marty. I'm dying. I hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man.	It really goes fast. Thanks, Uncle Al.
What if I say no?	Then I'd have to kick your ass, dear boy.  Go on, now.
But how?	BY A VOICE YOU HEAR FROM ON HIGH
What do you want?  This is a private area!  Get lost!	You ain't got nothin' I ain't seen.
Oh, girls.	Yes, Betty?
Hurry, Sister!	Get moving.  I'm right behind you.
It'll be hell.	Tell me about it.
JUST SING!	Sing!
Come on, we're late.	What?  What time is it?
Well, then there's only one thing to do.	What?
I'm getting experience.	You watch yourself!
Those people are wonderful!  Why don't we ever see them in church?	Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.
Oh my Lord!	Experience!
Are you leaving us?	Oh no.  We'll always be together.
Run!  Take off!	Again?
But what do they want?  Where are we going?	She's got nothing to do with this.  Let her go.
It has come to pass.	What?
Is this all the food I get?	Yes.  Until breakfast.
You sent for me?	You have a phone call.
Eddie, you've got to get me out of here.	Not again.  You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are.
I can't go with you.	What?
Then one day they find you.	They open a window.
But you didn't tell me!	We didn't tell you what?
And if she runs?	Take care of it.
Right.	So, take it off.
Get her!	Which one!
There she is!	Which one?
She's gettin' away!	Forget her!  We got the one we need! Step on it!
You didn't shoot!	Neither did you!
Where?	Find 'em!
Maybe you should take this.	A fine idea.
Where are we going?	Up.
What is it?	Listen.
We are leaving.	What happened?
What is it?	Stay back.
What now?	I doubt that's the end.
How are you?	Tired.
Blood.	What did you say?
Where are we going?	I do not know.  Away.
What was that?	His horse.
You cannot kill what is already dead.	Let her go!
There was not much blood, was there?	I didn't see none.
Go home.	May I see my mother?
Yeah, they's good all right.	You got any money?
Hey Jerry, how it's goin'. Good to see you. Been a long time.	Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?
How 'bout you, Jerry.	How are you, Bill?
I'll see you, Bill.	Okay, stop back by. Don't worry about your boy here, he's doin' good.
Well, I wouldn't let it get to you.	I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
You know what, by God?	What?
Leave.	Don't tell me what to do.
You got that shit right.	What exactly do you mean by that? I don't understand.
Wait a minute. You want to go with me? You can meet my mama.	I don't want to worry your mama with company.
You all right, Mama?	I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
Are you sure you're okay staying with that woman and boy?	Yes sir.
Yes sir.	So, you're really going to stay here?
Frank, don't talk that way. Who's that strange lookin' man behind you? Did he follow you in here?	Can I help you, sir?
He just got out of the state hospital.	I know.
Will that be cash or charge?	Better make it charge. 
Jesus, what happened to you?	It looks worse than it is. I'm okay.
I finished my story. I thought you might want to take a look at it.	I'd love to.
And what about for you?	Huh?
Two, right?	Uh, better make it one.
So. Are we ready?	Ready. Any time you are.
What do you mean?	I mean, it's a good story.
I told her she was going to meet her father.	You what?
Jesus Christ. This is all I need.	You told me you wanted to meet him. Well,here he is.
So you're just going to give up and go home?	I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.
What's this?	Why don't you open it and find out?
It's for you.	For me? And what am I supposed to do with a paper bag?
You going to sit here all day?	I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Yeah? Who is it?	It's me, honey. It's Mom.
Well?	Well what?
I'll tell you why they're not going anywhere.	Yeah? And why is that?
Hey, Jimmy. You got the time?	Huh?
I don't know.	Is it yours?
So you're saying it wasn't like that at all.	Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you.
Hi, kid.	Wow. They sure did a job on you.
I don't know.	You don't.
And when he came home.  Did he write you about this?  Or phone, perhaps.	Just showed up at my door, big as life and twice as mean.  Wanted to talk to my son.
My mom.  Would be the problem.	Why?  We're only talking.
Your line of work.  You must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth.	Like you couldn't believe.
I did.  Boy.	Three kids.  What's she going to do?
You said three minutes.	Won't take two.
It's the way it happened, I know it is.	No, you don't.
That's when he fell.	Fell.
You want me to say that.	I want you.  To tell the truth.
I beg your pardon.	All right, girls - from the top again.
Say, Joe - tonight's the night, isn't it?	I'll say.
Yeah - where were you?	With you.
We didn't see anything -  - did we?	No - nothing.  Besides, it's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off -
Where are we running, Joe?	As far away as possible.
Men?	Oh, you don't have to worry about that.
Hi, Jerry.  Everything under control?	Have I got things to tell you!
All right - so what do we do now?	First thing we got to do is get out of these clothes.
Good night, Sugar.	Good night, honey.
I'm a girl, I'm a girl, I'm a girl -	What did you say?
You all right?	I'm fine.
Not you, Sugar.	I'm just going to get some ice.
We don't have to run.	Oh yes, we do!
Oh, come on - you can do better than that.	I met one of them.
What do you mean, maybe?  I saw the way he looked at you.  He'll be there for sure.	I hope so.
Where did you girls play before?	Oh - here and there - and around.
I was it.	What's the big idea?
Just a moment, miss -  May I?	Help yourself.
Please.  It won't happen again.	No, thank you.  I'll walk.
Put it here.	Sugar, you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble.
Okay, Sugar - all clear.  You better go back to bed.	I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
Thanks, honey.	Good night, Sugar.
I wish they'd put us in the same room.	So do I.  But don't worry - we'll be seeing a lot of each other.
The most wonderful thing happened -	What?
Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.	I am?
Been waiting long?	It's not how long you wait - it's who you're waiting for.
See?  Nothing.	Nothing at all?
Is that anything?	Thanks just the same.
Would you do me a favor?	What is it?
Well - ?	I'm not quite sure.  Try it again.
I never knew it could be like this.	Thank you.
Good night.	Good morning.
Oh, no.  I'm off that stuff - for good.	Did you have a nice time?
Hey.	Hey.
Where Nick sleeping?	Why, with you.
What going on with you two?	I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now she getting married.
I thought you said you were crap.	I had to say something to get you here.
What his problem?	What?
Hey.	Oh, hello.
Hey, man.	Sorry, can you give us a moment?
That was a long time ago.	It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
What did he say exactly? I mean, you don think he wants me back?	I don know.
No, count it, anyway.	Why?
What?	It cute.
Sorry. I a little nervous. I never thought something like this would happen to me.	This happened to you?
Yes.	What?!
Don stop asking questions, okay?	Okay.
It hard to explain.	Show me.
I sorry I was such a bitch. I really appreciate your doing this.	It my job.
Yeah. You?	Yeah.
Hi.	Hi.
Oh, no. He told you.	You knew?
Yeah.	Then for once in your life, do something for yourself.
Here it is, right here.	That's where we come from first?
Here's one by a man that's very much alive.	What's his name?
I love you, son! Don't ever think I don't love you!  We gon' get to be friends?	Yes, Daddy! Yes!
You know somethin', Daddy?	What's that, son?
David Lee, it's time for you to get to bed!	Goodnight.
Don't take my Daddy! Please don't take my Daddy!	David, come back here!
Can I go day after tomorrow?	Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
I cut it on some glass and we got lost, Mama.	Did you find your father?
WHAT DID YOU SAY?!?!	I said -
Dude!	What? Fuck you guys, I wanna get out of here.
What?	I saw him last night!
Dude, that movie was fucking sweet!	You bet your fucking ass it was!
May I?	What?
This is terrible! This can't be happening!!	We HAVE to see this movie, dude!
That was sweet!	Where do they come up with this stuff?!
How can they do this?	It isn't fair!
What? What don't I get?  What don't I get?	I don't know, dude.
This is sweet!!	Totally!
Dude, do you know what you're doing?	No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.
Wow, a lot of people showed up.	Yeah, so what do we say?
And Bill?	Yes?
It's from your mother.	My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say?
You'd fuck your uncle!	YOU'D fuck your uncle!
Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!!	Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
You know I do.	I know.
Hey, I'm missing the party!	No! It can't be!
Now do what I say and keep your fucking mouth shut!	THAT'S IT!  I HAVE HAD ENOUGH!!!!
I think we're moving.	Well isn't that great.  Something to write home about.
Jesus, come on!	They're not going to make it!
Evening.	It can't be.
Well, it was nice meeting you. Enjoy the rest of the trip.	I'm sure I will.
What did you say to me?	It's a little late for you to be up.
All too well, captain.	Well shut it off at once!
No, I just ran it!  Why are you running it again?	Well it's a good thing that I did.
You're certain of that?	Trust me.  Even checked 'em with my own eyes.
I think I can handle it.	Well, maybe I will.  You sure you don't want anything?
Bridge!  Can anyone hear me?!	Yeah yeah yeah, give me a minute here.
Now do you want the good news first or the bad news?	You better start making sense!
Well that's your call.  Doesn't make a damn bit of difference to me.  Just as long as I get my cut.	Oh you'll get it, believe me.  So I'll see you in a few.
Is that clear?	That's clear.
We're going to die.	Will you shut up already?
What are we going to do?	I don't know.
We don't.	Well maybe there's a way out of here.
Everyone just stay put.	Wait.
Are you ready?	Ready as I'll ever be.
Yeah.  We did it.	So we did.
You're ready for the real thing?	At this point I'm ready for anything.
Do you want some advice?	Sure.
I'm not going with you.	What?  What are you talking about?
And what are you going to do?!	I'm going to try and buy you some time.  I can get to the bridge from here.
What the hell are you doing?	We have room!  Let's go!
Will you marry me?	Marry you?
Well now what are we gonna do!	How am I supposed to know?
It's getting too cold in here.  I can't stand this anymore!	Baby, take it easy.
I'm looking for a man.	What kind of man?
Where'd you get this ball?	It's mine.
Who are you? Who sent you here?	I'm your son. You're a hard father to find.
What the fuck is this?	What's it look like to you?
So, eh, you never saw me. Right?	I never saw you.
My poor baby!	You see what you did?  Take your ball and get out.
Hello?	Hello, mom?
Don't tell me, John.	Cool!
I came here to have a word with your dad.	What do you want with my dad?
Mind if I cut in?	No, not at all.
What are you going to do about your brother?	You're here.
It wouldn't bother you if Buzz was in danger, would it?	Nope, I couldn't care less.
You wanted me to kill him, didn't you?	If he's not dead, he'll keep coming back.
Where are you going?	I think your brother may have already gotten to Buzz. He gets into his car.
Don't do it, Norman!	Do you see it?
Don't do it!	Now!
Norman, please!  Don't!	Pull it, damn it!
Thank you, Colonel.	Captain.
Come with me.  The team's already waiting.	What team?
How deep is he?	A thousand feet.
What is it, Norman?	Take a look.
Maybe we shouldn't.	What?
Harry's missing.	What do you mean, he's missing?
You can't just leave Harry down here, sir.	I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
What the hell?  It shut us down.	Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
I see it.	Pull it.
Any sign of Harry?	Nothing, sir.
Nothing, sir.	What the hell is going on here?
Yes, sir.	Well, where the fuck is he?
Ted?  Captain?	Yes, Harry.
So how do we get it open?	Ted seems to have some ideas.
Look at this.	What is it?
What's wrong?	What do you make of this?
Norman!	Get this thing off me.
Norman.	What are they?
You said something to him, didn't you?	What?
Still clear?	Still clear.
Looks like some sort of code.	Why would Harry go back to using a code?
I'm sorry.	For what?
What is it, Norman?	Where are you?
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.	Your watch.
What's wrong, Norman?	I'm feeling better.
It's getting cold.	You think I'd really drink that?
Then where's it coming from?	From you, Norman.  From your mind. You're doing it.
What is that?  What are you doing?	What?
Would it work?	Yes.  And I think we already know it will.
I don't get it.	It doesn't make any sense.
He doesn't wait for an answer.	Who says it's a he?
Just in time, too.	In time for what?
How are you feeling, Norman?	What?
Nice work, Norman.	Whatever I can do to help.
Our answer.	To what?
I can't.  If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong.	Am I?
Norman?	What is it, Harry?
What is it?	You know what it is, Harry.
Did I kill her?	I don't think so.
We're never gonna make it.	Shut up and open the door.
I can't reach her.	Hold on.
Hold on.	Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
Get her out of the seat, I need room to sit.  Harry?	I'm trying.  There.
You know how to work this thing?	No idea.
She told me what you said, Norman.	What is it, Harry?
English?	That's right.
What'd you say?	"We are friends".
Good idea, Ted.	Thank you.
How are the others?	The others, sir?
Well, for one reason, we don't have your other five thousand.	Who's going to pay me then?
Sorry, but that was the only way to get you down.	Couldn't we have tried to think of something else first!
I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing.	But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
What's wrong?  What's happening?	Keep away, I'm fine, I'm fine.
This isn't going to work.	Why didn't you say so before.
Are you alright ?	I'm getting better.
So what are you doing later ?	Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
You can't walk me home.	Why not ?
Isn't it great to be in love ?	How do I know if this is love ?
You talk to Carl ?	He left this morning. He couldn't say where.
I'm gonna miss you.	I'll miss you, too, Johnny.
Do you mean it ?	I said it. Isn't that enough ? Don't forget to write !
Well, look at this. The three of us back together again.	How are you, Carl ?
Which way ?	Up. We gotta be near A Company by now.
Leave me, Lieutenant ! That's an order !	No way, ma'am !
Cover me.	You got it.
Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can.	We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
Don't get any ideas. She's my girl.	You can never be sure.
Let's go.	Move out.
Can you walk ?	Not a problem.
How bad are you, pal ?	Been better, buddy.
All dead except one, sir.	Kill the bitch.
Mom's expecting you for dinner tonight.	I'll be there.
I quit.	You quit.
You like my play.	Yes.
No, of course, you don't want to talk about it.	It's about a man who gets a second chance.
You get what you pay for.	That's true.  You grow up here?
You like kids?	Never saw the point of 'em.
Hi.	You going to ask me in?
Thank you.	Read the card.
Don't you think you should put them in water?	Why?
Start?  This isn't a good time.	Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?
You can do it.	Because I'd met someone else.
Hi.	Hi.
Press still works.	It does?
Good morning.	Sleep well?
What are you going to do?	I'm going to tell the truth.
What, what what are you doing here?	Yes, that's right.
Hi!	We had a date.
How big is this horse?	Fifteen hands.
Stay ready.  Stay by yourself in your room.	What'll I do for fun?
Then I hope you wouldn't tell anyone that I gave you this.	I wouldn't tell anyone anything that happened between me and somebody who was my friend.
Aren't you ever in school?	There's other things to be learned.
Kiss my ass.	Well.
What's in the case?	Eight hundred thousand dollars in cash.
I want to make a good film.	I know you do.
I can't.	Why?
Let's speak English.  You've got to help the side.	You want me to lie.
You can't write it?	I can write it.  I can't type it.
How do they know that, you told them?	No.
Do something.	You tell me what to do, I'll do it.
You hear that?	Yes, I hear it.
Ben!  What's wrong?	I killed her!
I didn't say that.  Why would I say that?	Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.
So why are you asking me?	I like talking about it.  At least, to you.
But we do have a choice.  To make it better.  Instead of worse.	Like how?
Wow.  Who's that for?	Well.  It's for you.
Actually.  She's kind of cool, when you get to know her.	I bet.
And don't tell her I told you.	Secret's safe with me.
You wouldn't kiss him, huh?	Not with my mouth open.
He's not even there.  You don't see him, you don't hear him, you're just too much of a woman to bother with little boys.	This is a joke, right?
I don't want to say goodbye.	Don't. Take me with you.
Are you afraid for me?  Where I'm going.	Yes.
I don't have to listen to you!  You're not my mother.	Thank God for that!
I hate her.  I really hate her.	There you are!
IS THAT YOU?	IT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND, BIG GUY, OPEN UP.
Ben!  Oh my Ben!  Are you alright?	I knew where I was all the time.
So you're okay.	I'm still sick, but I'm better.
Okay.  These are good.	I helped.
So what do you think we're gonna talk about?	You dying.
People beat it, don't they?  All the time.	Every day.  More and more.
You can't do that, I won't let you!	No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to keep, not a job that's hard to lose, can't be both.
Are you here?	I'm here.
I'm afraid she's going to walk.	And I'm supposed to care.
I know.  I wouldn't know what to say.  If it were you.	We're going to win this.
What happens next?	I live or I die.
You bet you are.	How the hell would you know?
They came out of my body!	See, I know that.
Now we're going to have a fight, you and I.	Are we.
You've turned her into you.  And I may not get another chance.  To turn her back.	That's what it is.  And that's all it is.
She's not gonna die.	I know that.
Just like to make sure.  That your past.  And my future.  Are real different.	Well, they will be.
Can we go sit somewhere?	Let me put it this way.  Hell, no.
Where you goin'?	I'm gonna get me a drink.
Out! Leave the table!	What?
Hey.	Hey. What's up?
Was anyone in my room today?	Is everything OK?
We did the same thing last year also.	How was the class?
Hey, you want to hear my short story now?	Huh?
Fuck!	I'm going in there.
So? How was school today?	The same.
I don't think there's any hope, either. I was just trying to make you feel better.	Thanks.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all.	Well, now you have.
It's over there.	Thanks.
No, not really.	Any books you like to read for fun?
You want some?	No, thanks.
Let's move it we got company!	What happened!
Forget about it.	I wasn't angry with you I was angry with him.
I'm going first.  Taking the fire. If we go out together we're all dead!	What are you talking about?
How's the arm?	It's nothing to worry about.
That's it!  Up ahead!	Where does it lead?
So, what are we looking at White?	What do you mean?
Can I have a glass of water?	Certainly - how about some breakfast?
Go back to sleep, baby.	What did you say, sir?
Colonel, you're not drunk, are you, man?	No, sir.
Well, Mister President.	What kind of trouble?
Yes, sir.  One thing, Mister President.	Yes?
Let me worry about that, Major. I've still got my red line to the Air Command.	That's right, sir.
What shall we drink to, sir?	To peace on earth.
Well, I know they've been going on for years, and they haven't gotten any place.	Not yet, Major.  Not yet.
Major, those are my boys out there dying.	Yes, sir.  Why don't you stop the fighting, sir?
To peace on earth, Major.	Peace on earth.
Then this is it.	What?
No, this looks like the real thing.	Yeah, it sure looks like the real thing, all right.
So am I.	Listen, I think I'm hit bad.
How do you know he's dead?	Hell, he looks dead.
He's dead, all right.	Listen, give me a shot quick!
You sure have to hand it to those guys.	What do you mean?
We are?	Alright. She told him to meet us here. Fuck.
That was really great.	Was it okay?
Yeah, we all want to see him. So when's he coming?	Yeah, when's he coming?
Stuck with what guy?	What?
I don't know. Later. I don't know.	Yes!
Don't let 'em fight.	The dude wants it.
A long, long, long, long, while.	Okay, okay.
Fuck it!	You know what? Go with him. Just go with him.
Yeah.	Come on.
Sure. You make art and you want people to see it.	Wait, what happened to the tree?
Hey, man.	Hey.
What do you mean? His girlfriend?	Well, that's one way of putting it.
It's safe, come on.	That's it. That's it! I'm calling the police.
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself.	Are you talking to me?
No, no, no, no, no, it's new.	Please.
Thanks. See man?	You know? I remember coming here with my parents.
You okay, man? You okay?	I didn't want to eat this much, man.
Thanks, man!	I'll be in the car, okay?
Will you stand up for me?	Okay.
Hi.	Hi.
Thinks he is. Well, he is.	He is?
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, it's, you know, it's a bed and hot water.	It does look good.
It's coming along.	Thank you.
Can you tell me what happened?	He's drunk.
You don't need to sit next to me right now.	Who were you talking to?
No, wait, wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! What is your name?	Look, why do you care, huh?
God, I haven't seen you all day.	You could've come over.
Was that supposed to be me?	No.
No, not, not everything. This. I am the man in your life.	Man?
Yes, you asshole.	About what?
Of course I do!	Name one.
Come on.	No. No, no, no.
Oh, hi. I thought you guys got lost.	Hey, where did you go? We were worried about you.
I've run out of words.	Wait. What, what are you saying?
Sorry.	So how's college?
So you think I should?	What?
Great.	Yeah, maybe later.  Hey! Hey!
So who are you?	What do you mean?
Ready?	What are you saying?
I hope you're happy!	This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
Okay, now, you guys all take care, okay? Oh, man, I feel so good. I feel good 'cause I'm hanging out with you guys, man. You know? I mean, I forgot what it was like to just hang out.	Yeah.
Yeah, come on, play it.	Oh, no, man. I can't.
Alright, alright already.	Alright!
I hate it here. It's so ugly, it's like being dead. You got out of here, you know? I'm ready to go.	Yeah, but sometimes I try to figure out why I left in the first place, you know? I think about people and I wonder what they're doing.
You know, my mom has this saying.	Yeah?
What the fuck are you talking about?!	Nobody's fucking anybody!
You know, man, it's none of your business what I do, okay?	It's none of my business?
I'm going out later.	No car.
Sure, this'll go on all night.	I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
You forgot this.	Thanks.
I mean it.  It's no good to me anyway.  Help yourself.	Why should you do that?
Look, Betty, It can't be done. It's out.	You're tough, all right.
Hello, Betty.	I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful?
Goodbye, young fellow.  We'll see what we can do.	I'm not worried.  Everything will be fine.  The old team together. Nothing can stop us.
Just a minute, you!	Yeah?
What's that?	Just a scene I cut out.
Now what is it?  Where's the fire?	I've lost my car.
What on earth, darling? It took you hours.	I ran into some people I knew.
That's a lie!  They still want me!	No, they don't.
Suppose you listen just for a minute -	Madame is waiting.
I made your bed this afternoon.	Thanks.  How did you know I was going to stay, this afternoon?
Some men are here.  They asked for you.	I'm not here.
How is she?	She is upstairs.
We've come for the car.	What car?
So you need three hundred dollars? Of course, I could give you three hundred dollars.  Only I'm not going to.	No?
Bring something to drink.	Yes.  Madame.
It must be the girls. One of the girls.	But which one?
I think I'd better keep it.	Whatever you say.
I don't feel like it right now.	She didn't take it from you, did she?
What's happening?	I'm taking you to the hospital.
Don't leave me.	I have to.
You're alive! She didn't kill you!	Who didn't?
Of Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone.	What do you feel about me?
There's one sure way to find out how you feel.	What's that?
Is this how?	Terrific.
She said it wouldn't last.	What wouldn't last? What's the matter with you?
I don't love you any more.	Just like that?
Away. From you.	But why?
Hi.	Hello. Are you still mad at me?
You think so?	I don't see why not.
And you can see how you feel about me, right?	Yes.
Hey, I thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.	I did.
They want me. Doesn't it make you proud?	Yeah.
Guess! Go on.	I don't know. You seem afraid.
Hey, where you going?	I've got things to do.
What are you making:	It's going to be a tree, I think.
What's a tree?	It's something they have on Earth. You know, where your cousin went.
There isn't any.	This is all your clothes?
No thanks. You go on.	You sure?
That was meant for me!	Thank you. I'm going to close this up again.
I'm free. I can never thank you enough.	For what?
There is a way.	I knew it!
You're going to take me back?	Going to try. Didn't say I could.
What's that? Never saw anything like that.	Don't stop. Keep moving.
Yeah? What do you want?	Buddy, are we in trouble.
Man, you don't never pass out, do ya?	Nope.  Never. 
You look wonderful.	You always did.  Can I give you a hand with that?
The dog's always doing that.  And the car's always doing that.	Can I help?
He really was!	Uh-huh.
Hey, boss.	Just the man I wanted to see!
And do nothing. Just sit there.	Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
Yeah? How's it look?	It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
Thanks.  Let's go	I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
I thought you'd never get here.	Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
I'll do more than tell you. I'll show you, back at my place. If you'll just do me one little favor first.	Okay, what is it? You want a ride?
How would you know?	Hey, I know a lot of things!
I can't see anything.	Turn on the light.
I can't! It's out of control!	But how? Where's it getting the power from ???!
Okay? Goodbye.	You've got to pick three more numbers.
Mr. White, the next number, please?	How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
He's coming! He's going to hurt me!	Don't bet on it!
Jimmy, how's the -	Yeah. I'll check.
Are you okay?	She'll be fine.
I don't?	Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.
Where were you?	I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
I'm in love with you. How do you feel?	We'd better talk.
I want to.	Let's go to my place.
Let's go to my place.	Your place?  Maybe I should change,  Maybe you should, too.
You did it. You gave it all up for me. I . . . I don't know what to say.	Say you love me.
Blood . . . my . . . blood . . .	Let's get you inside . . . .
Don't . . . it's not your fault . . . you didn't know . . .	He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen.
Hi.	Oh, hi.
Sleep well?	Never closed my eyes.
I'll try to remember that . . .	Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
Everything on it?	Everything on it.
It has everything.	Wrong.
Free!	Free!
Oh . . . no, there's no one back home.	What about here?
Well, I don't understand.	I'm sorry.
Would you mind taking a walk with me?	Absolutely!
Is he for real?	One hundred percent.  And I like him that way.
What's he going to say?	Something . . . wonderful.
Hey! He looks . . . normal.	He's . . .  beautiful. Perfect.
I'll deal with you later.	Right, good. Tell you what, we'll wait right here. Till you get back.
Me?	Not you.  You.  Tell me again.
Keep warm now.	I will.
I'd like to.	Well!
I'll bet you have some good ideas.	Hey, you're getting a better class of people in your office these days, Boss.
Are there any more at home like you?	Not really, no.
What now, my love?	Huh?
Can I take you to the airport?	Not unless you can fly.
Nuts. He made it.	Tough guy, huh?
Bet he makes it.	You're on.
Shut up.	I didn't say a word.
Ready?	Ready.
Don't let me down.	You?! How about me?
Boy!	Gets you where you live, huh?
Easy now, miss, I've got you???	You've got me? Who's got you???
Is that real enough for you?	It is for me.
I can help you.	Not unless you can raise the dead.
I'll be back around nine.	Okay.
Are you sure?	Yeah.
I used to like it here.  I used to care about what happened.  Now I think I'll sell my house and move the fuck away.	Billy, please.  The children.
Have you been waiting long?	A while.
What time's he coming home?	When the game's over, I guess.
You're leaving.	I better get back.
Good night, Billy.	Good night.
You've talked to Billy?	I did.
What do you think?	Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
So do you like your new room?	It's interesting.
Is this mine?	Yes.  It's a present.
Is he coming over now?  Right away?	That's what he said.
What do you mean?	People who will help our cause.
DADDY!!!	Yes.
So you're just the thing we need.	Excuse me?
Yes.	And where did you sit that morning?
No.	Did there come a time when all the children had been picked up?
I was scared.	Why were you scared?
That was great.	Really?
What took so long?	Nothing.
They say I'm lucky because I can't remember the accident.	Don't even try to remember.
The door needs a lock.	Sure.  I'll fix it right away.
He's a lawyer.  He's our lawyer.	You and Mom have a lawyer?
You're going to need special care for a long time to come.  It's not going to be easy.  Not for you, not for any of us.  Because we love you so much.  And it's going to cost money.  More than we can imagine.	What about insurance?  Doesn't insurance pay for these things?
Are you sleeping?	No.
Uh huh.	When?
That's the third time he's called today.	He wants me to break a leg?
I tried to reach you twice -	What do you do for that hundred a week.  Fall out of bed?
Look, whatever you want me to do, I'll do.  I just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?	No one must follow your work.
No good.	Let me try mine.
I'm right here.  I'm fine.  What's the dog's name?	Max.
Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right?	Right.
Swear.	What?
Everything.	Cool.
Excellent.	Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.
Not even of dying?	No.
Drive for a minute.	Where you going?!
We don't have much time.	What?
No!	I'm sorry, John.
Easy money!	Where'd you learn all this stuff?
Out of the way, John!	No!  Don't kill him!
It's okay.  It'll by okay.  We'll figure it out.	I love you, John.  I always have.
Ready to rock?	Ready.
John, get out of the way!!	SHOOT!!!!
Are you afraid?	Yes.
Where do you stand on all this?	On all what?
What does he mean, too correct?	I don't know.
Don't see me to my door, there's no need.	But I promised your mother.
Okay, let's see. How long were you in the camp for?	Three months.
I made no deal!	I don't buy that.
If it's too hot, open your tie.	I wish to say something.
Do you know what that is?	Of course I know what that is.
Show me.	Show you?
Great catch, kid. The boy runs off.	So. You wanted to see me.
And ask him about his private life.	His private life?
So, you never heard of him.	Nope.
What do you think?	Great.
Great.	You're a big help.
Do you understand?	Yes.  Don't hurt me.
This is a mistake.  I haven't done anything.	No. But you will.  It's very important that you live.
I caught one, back there.	Caught one?  You mean you got shot?
We gotta get you to a doctor.	It's okay.  Forget it.
Sleep.  It'll be light soon.	Okay.  Talk some more.
Thanks a lot.	What's that?
That's where we're going.	Why?
Let's go.  Time to move out.	Fuck you!  Let go of me!
Is this enough?	Yes.  And I don't want to know where you got it.
I don't think I like this.	You're not supposed to.
That stuff's two hours cold.	I know.
This is nuts.	What is your problem?
See you around.	Where are you going?
Don't even think about it.	Why not?
I'll wait.	It's not like anyone could actually open it.
There goes a thousand dollars.	Your shoes cost a thousand dollars?
Goodnight.	I don't think I've ever spent this much time with someone who didn't even ask my name.
What are you doing here?	Can we talk?
What is it?	Is this you?
Want anything to drink?	You?
Take the picture out.	What's wrong?
What did you say?	I didn't say anything.
It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive.	It might be best if we didn't talk.
Who is it?	What do we do?
What are you doing here?	I'm back from the dead.
For you.	You shouldn't have.
Tell me you'll call.	Okay.
Tell me where we're going.	Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
The phone's dead.	Really?
Really?	Yeah.
Drive in.	What are you gonna do anyway?  You won't get your money back.
Thank you.	Have a nice day.
Is everything alright?	Fine.
What makes you ask?	I'm not sure.
Goodnight.  See you home.	Goodnight.  Where was she?
Pleasure to meet you, I'd like to see my brother, thank you.	Your brother.  Will you come with me?
I wasn't expecting you.	Wanted to wish you luck.  Not that you'll need it.
He hasn't called back.	What about the house?
Couldn't get the last ones.  You?	I did okay.
That could have been worse.	Yeah.
Well, this lot is full!	He must have left.  Didn't like the looks of the place or something.
I didn't do it.	You could have.
Was sure she'd be in here.	Where in the hell can she be.
Are you working with her?	Mary, I'll meet you outside.
Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did it?	I don't know.
Someone is playing with you.	Why?
You know what he's really upset about?	What?
Maybe they're Mary's.	Mary came with me.
Is she asleep?	Yes.  But I promised I wouldn't let her alone the whole night.
What do you want?	Oh!  You scared me.
Why?	Why'd she kill herself?
I love this house.  I really love this house.	You're okay.
You've been out of the world for a long time, haven't you?	Yes.  I've missed it.
Is it over?	No, it's getting worse.
Are you sure?	I think so.
They're all in here.  All the ones he killed.  They're just children! We have to help them!	Come on!  Why are we waiting?
What's the matter?	Nothing.  I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
We think someone is here.	We think?
No.	Why not?
Hey.	Come over here.
How they goin', kid?	Not bad.
Where do you think he is, Mike.	We'll find him.
You broke last time.	Let him break - he likes to break.
Man knows what he likes.	Lookin' good.
I didn't expect anyone.	No reason.
Who done it, then?	Huh?
No.  Not at all.  Do we?	Not me, man.
Why didn't you just kill him, you had the chance.	That would be too easy.
I've been wondering something.	Again?
Why did you come here?	Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
Sort a few things out.	Been busy, have you.
Here, aren't you gonna let me in.	Try calling me again.
When did you get in?	Yesterday.  Afternoon.
Been away a lot.	Where else?
How much.	Five thousand.
She's nice lookin'.	So what.
How'd you get in here.	Walked.
He's expecting you?	I doubt it.
Hello there.	What are you doing here?
What kind of trouble are you in?	No trouble.
What.	Tell me.
Yeah.	We've certainly missed you.
No problem!	Way out of line.
Honey.	How are you?
Will anyone else say they knew?	I don't know. I don't think so.
Thanks. Thanks for seeing me, at home.	Oh, hell. Drink?
Coffee, Ed?	I'm fine. Thanks.
Ed, how're you holding up?	I'm OK, Walter, thanks.
Frank.	Huh?
This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together!	Yeah.
They're just people like you and me, Ed. Remember that.	Uh-huh.
I don't understand.	He's the dead guy.
Hello!	Hello.
Yes, sir.	Could you come with me please?
Forget it!	Calm down.  I found it!
The body?	What's left of it.
If you don't mind, this could be important.	You're kidding.
Look.  It's some kind of letter.	May I see that?
Lieutenant!  It's me.	What is it?
It's still back there!	I know.
What's that?	All right everybody, hold up!
Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?	I'd say we're in its home.
Come back and get me.	We will.
You work here?	Yes, I do.
Quiet!	What is it?
They've got something.	Keep the light up.  I can't see.
Stop!	Holy mother, what is that?
There's something out there!  Let's go get it now!  That's why we came down here, isn't it?	He's right.  Follow me.
Oh no.  I smell it.	Keep the animal quiet.
Where would we find it?	I'm not sure.  We should split up. You take that hall and I'll take this one.
What happened?	I don't know.
You're not.  Where is it?	Gone.
What is it doing?	It's scared of me.
Help someone!	Oh God!  Help!
You smell that?	It's coming.  Run.
Just like John.  He won't listen.	I have to shoot.
He doesn't care.	Do it!
Welcome.	Thank you.
Nothing was real.	You were real.  That's what made you you so good to watch.
How can they have a child?	It's not gonna be his, you idiot.
It's okay.  I probably wouldn't talk to me either.	I'm sorry.  It's not up to me.
I've got to talk to you.	Sorry, I'm way behind.
What's that?	It's a surprise.
This'll pass.  Everybody thinks like this now and then.  Come to bed.	I think I'm going to stay up for a while.
I have to talk with you.  But not here.  Let's go for a walk.	I'm sorry, I'm late.
Let's go now.	What?!
How are you, Mother?	Well, I made it through another night.
They're coming.  Any minute.	Who?
Do you live around here?	Yeah.
Not supposed to talk about it.	You're not supposed to talk about it? Who told you that?
I think you better tell us.	We don't even know you.
You've got something to show me.	Yes.
You follow me out here for a reason?	Yeah, I did.
Those people were already dead.	Before the bomb went off?
I think you're full of shit.	Do you?
How can I reach you?	You can't.
Now what?	It's locked?
Had you.	No you didn't.
Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.	All I told them was the truth.
I wake you?	No.
You think they went left?	I don't know why I think they went right.
What do you think it is?	I have no idea.
What are you doing?	Come on!
Where'd they go?	I don't know.
We've got to keep moving.	Where are we?
Why are you telling me this?	I thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you've worked.
Don't bring it home in this.	Okay.
Is it cold in here?	What happened?
Damn him.	What's wrong?
COME ON!	I can't leave him!
They're hungry.	I got it.
Thank you.	No problem.
What now?	's broken.
I have done this, you know.  Been inside.	No.
Nervous?	Absolutely.
I need it.	Now?
You sure you want to go through with this?	What else do we do?!
Right here.	Next time, tell me, okay?
Thank you.	Sit down.
No.	He has a little dog.
I don't know. They didn't answer.	I was told there were only two men there.
Harry?	Yes. He moved his head, but the rest is good, isn't it?
Might as well I suppose. Are you busy?	Just another part I've got to learn.
Tell me about him.	Tell you what?
Oh, that was many years ago.	Tell me more.
That's Harry's place, isn't it?	Yes.
Let's go away.	What's the matter?
I thought you were going to go away. Aren't the police after you?	I don't know.
I'm going back home.	Why?
Harry.	I'm sorry.
What is on your mind? Why did you hide?	Hide? Can't a fellow have a drink?
Here, it will be cold on that train.	I shall be all right.
Do you know this man?	I have never seen him.
See much of him before that?	Once in a while.
So would I.	Bring him in.
Didn't I?	You all did.
What time is it?	Two thirty.
Wait a minute - let me out.	Well, there's not much time.
Shall I go over there, sir?	No, no. Leave them for a while.
Well, yes. I suppose that is what I meant to say.	Of course, of course, of course.
Hello, Harry.	Well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
What can I do, old man, I'm dead, aren't I?	You can help her.
Well, I've got quite a lot on my mind.	You wouldn't do anything.
We came out of his place like this, and were walking this way. A friend of his called to him from over there. Harry went across and from up there came the truck. It was just about here.	Here?
Not yet.	But you will.
Speak English?	English?
Already gone.	Who?
Excuse me!	Yes, sir.
There was a third man - he didn't give evidence.	You don't mean that doctor?
I have no evidence. I saw nothing. I said nothing. It's not my business.	Well make it your business.
Yes, it is.	I am not a bad man.
I thought there was something funny about the whole thing.	Funny?
That's all you meant?	What else?
Excuse me.	Yes?
Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.	Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.
I don't know - I'm American.	So?
Everyone ok?	We're ok.
She is gone!	What happened?
Did you sleep well?	Not too bad.
Hi.	Hi there. Here, take a look.
Have you told someone?	No.
We lost our key.	Where did you lose it?
What do you think you're doing?	Who the fuck are you?
Do we have to listen to this shit?	Yes.
You write that?  Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you.	I have a job.
When can I see you?	You can't.
Your father??	He's at a home out here.
I'm coming to your room tonight.	No.
I want to learn to read it.	Why?
How have things been going?	Fine.
What are you doing here?	I just came to get some stuff. I'll be out in five minutes.  He doesn't want me around.
Which was his room?	Number ten.
Oh, what is this shit?	Keep driving. Don't slow down.
Who'd you kill?	Four. But no one this important.
And what did you do?	What are you trying to say?
Are you going to keep it?	Yes.
I tell you she's mine!	Hello!
He looks strange, doesn't he? Like a baby that just learned to walk.	Have you known him long?
Huh?  Well listen to him!  Do you hear that?	No.
Is he alright?  What happened?	The fool was asleep!  If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with?
Why?	Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
No, no!	Not at all!
Can I come in?	No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep.
Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?	Who?
I'm going back home.	Why?
How are you?	I got fired.
Hello?	It's me again.
Why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here.	You'll understand.
You've got to tell me what happened?	I saw how it has to be.
Promise me one thing.	Anything.
Why don't you ask me?	What?
Uncle Louis!	No, no.  It's true.  When I was in New York, oh boy!  Before my accident, you understand? 
Well?	What?
I'll go see how he's doing.	Let him sleep.
What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.	C'mon follow me.
Want to get a drink?	Sure. Why not.
What was that!?	I said, do you come here often!?
What!?	I said, yeah, about once a week!
Is he in love with you?	I don't know 
This is for "mama and the kids."	What about me?
Then what do you do?	I sleep it off.
Now I know I didn't hurt nobody when I was drunk - -	Of course, not, Charlie. I never thought you did.
Sure!	No. I'm serious about this.
What's left of him.	Where? Where did you find it?
What did they say before the bad card came up?	You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
Cut.	What are you doing that for?
Don't look at it!	Let me see it 
Love is different for different people.	I suppose so. I suppose it will be different for us, too  when everyone knows. Then we will be just like other people.  But these last weeks will always be our secret  a lovely secret to remember all our lives.
Well, I'd best be off.	I want to ask you something.
Come to look around?	More or less.
Are you all right?	Now look what you've done.
I suppose he was trying to make me feel bad.	And I suppose you don't feel bad!
No. No, thanks.  Now we've got to do it ourselves.	We will 
That right.	Will you please come with me?
I will of course do my best to hang onto it.	Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
Do you think we let him get away with the murder of my brother?	We? You and your parents killed your husband?
Damn it! You can fucking walk away from this!	It up to you whether they walk or not.
Problems?	Is my money in there?
Am I supposed to know him?	Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.
Welcome to the club.	Excuse me?
Will you at least let me stay with you?	It would not be the same without you.
Do you know how to count?	Of course I do?  Bring them up!
So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??	Hey, my friend!  I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?	God knows, but it was a bad idea!
What are you doing out here?	I might ask you the same question.
They won't come anyway.	What do you mean, they won't come?
No!  I don't want to know anymore! Leave me alone!  I didn't kill that man!	Oh no?  How about this one?
You think you are ready now?	Yes, my lord.
Beautiful.	And what does he say to you?
Someone you know?	Yes.
I'm going to get a doctor.	You can't, it's too dangerous.
How long have you been married?	Just over a year.
What did I tell you?	What are you doing?
Will I still be able to play?	Let's find out.
To tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.	How will we sleep?
Must feel better this side of the wall.	Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
Get your things together, you have to leave!	What's happened?
I'm on the run!	What's happened?
Have you seen this?	What, I'm working, what?
What's happened?	Oh my God, it's terrible, you've got to do something, oh my God!
What's this about?	Sit down, have tea, I'll start lunch when the girls get back.
Mama, that was a great dinner.	It certainly was.
It's not funny.	Well, you know what's funny? You're funny with that ridiculous tie.
What's the matter? Are you sick?	Hungry.
I tried your friends. They're not at that address any more.  But.	You made contact?
What's happening?	We're getting out.
Watch your feet!	Watch your feet!
Careful! Watch his hand.	Watch his hand
I'll have to come and hear you play. what do you play.	Nothing just yet
She wants to see what you can do.	I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
Oh no, it can't come now.	It must come.
She wants it to come.	Yes and so do I, but there are too few of us here to carry it. TOO - HEAVY
Hello, then.	Hello.
Give it to me!  Please.  I gotta know it's all there!	You just sit tight, old man.  We're gonna have to get you to a doctor.  I'll call a cop.
You gonna stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat?	I picked something up on the way.
He's not as tough as he'd like to think.	Neither are we.
You just worry about your end, kid.	If we ever get to it.
You think he'll show?	Did he say he wouldn't?
All you gotta do is show up with some money and look like a fool.	I also gotta win.
I can't lay that off in time.  We lose a bet that big, it could break us.	If ya win it could make ya, too.
My end was only one.	Then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere.
You got a back door to this place?	No.  What's wrong with the front?
What does this guy want?	He'd like to kill me.
You sure it'll be one of these two?	No.  They're just the only ones we know of.
You should always look to the back too, kid.	I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
Well, what did I tell ya?	You're a lucky man, all right.
What happened?	I didn't get the bet down in time.
You want a drink or something?	No.
Sorry.  I don't know anything about it.	Come on, gimme a break.
Darling, your father's all right. He'll turn up in time.	But tonight is Christmas Eve!
What?	Nothing.
How are you?	Another young man.
Well!	That is, if it's all right with you.
Oh, Andy.	Don't cry.
This is a pretty dead bunch, isn't it?	You're high enough.
Darling, don't cry.  Please.  I know it's terrible.  But isn't it really better this way?	Oh, Andy, Andy!
What is it?	Nothing.
That isn't true.  It was about your father.  Where is he?	He's all right.  Isn't that enough?
Oh!	Now do you believe me!
Is your father still in there?	He's waiting for you.
You know, we know each other.	Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
Come on in.	I've got to see you alone!
Dead?	He's been dead for three months.
It's been the same one for three months.	Forgive me.  How are you?
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.	Yes, she would.
Wait a minute.  When is it going to be? I'm leaving town tonight.	Where are you going?
How's your brother?	He's all right.
I never saw him before.	What's he want of you?
This gun yours?	No.
Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?	Man to man, I'm not.
What're you doing here?	I'll take care of him.
Are you kidding?	No.
There are a few things we want to check up on.	I see.
That's all right.  Well, we'll be going.	Goodbye.
You did!	That's nothing.  I saw him myself.
That's ridiculous.	Let him have his say out.
But he's interested!	I don't mind telling you I'd rather have you working with us than against us.
What are you going to do?	Just what I said I'd do.
and there she was lying dead.  The police said she'd probably been killed about ten minutes before I got there.	I thought you said you weren't going there.
We're just having a little drink.	So I see.
Who's that man?	He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.
I want that money right now, or I'll hand you over to the police.	Go ahead!
Did you get my money?	I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.
Thanks, and goodbye.	What'll I do if something comes up?
What's that?	This is your party.
So it's you he was after!	Hello, baby.
Pretty girl.	If you like 'em like that.
I'd better order some food.  That sounds like an interesting case.  Wouldn't you like to take it?	I haven't the time.  I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.
Isn't that my drink?	What are you drinking?
Where did you get that?	She brought it in.  Trying to make me believe she did it.
Nick!  Nick!  Are you asleep?	Yes.
Everybody says you were a grand detective.	They were kidding you.
That poor girl is in a tough spot.	There's nothing I can do to help her.
But it's Christmas now.	Breakfast.
Nick!  Nick!  There's someone to she you,	That's great.  I was afraid I'd have to go to sleep.
You're a fine watch dog.	He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
I never saw that before.	No.  It's a Christmas present.
Well, that's that.  Stay there, Nick!	It's not going to hurt me to get up.
How long has he been dead?	Couple of months anyway.
I can't wait any longer.  Tell me, do you think one of them did it?	Yes.
Is that true?	I don't know.
Nick Charles here?	Yes.  Nick!
Where are you going?	Home!
What are we going to do!?	We're going to keep driving.
What kind of mine?	I don't know, and I wasn't about to mess with it.
Ready?	Yeah.
And they can't fly around out there forever.	So we wait.
It'll be too dark to make our way back now.  Let's bed down for the night and head out at first light.	What about the gold?
What happened?	I told you.  He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us.
I'm the one's got the big stick.	Suppose I don't go for that?
Just keep quiet.	I have to answer him.
Give it to me!	If I give it to you, will you let us go?
Oh, man, you're not going to fall for that.	There might be something in there.
What!?  What!?	I did it!  I got the box open.
Now this is war.	Roger that.
But that's the great thing about Gold.  A little goes a long way.	You know what I'm doing with my part of the gold?
Shut up!  Both of you shut the hell up!	We've got to do something.  We've got to turn around.
She okay?	Yeah.  Yeah, she's fine.
What?	I'm just thinking, you know, if the rest of the boys knew what we're doing.  I mean if they knew what we were coming back with.
What!?	Mine.
What?	Mine.  Land mine!
Oh, God!  Oh God!	Just be cool.
You're going to be fine.	You're not going to let me die, are you!? Don't let me die!
Don't!	It's a fire fight.
What are we going to do?  What the hell are we going to do?	We're not going to do anything.
A whole lot of nothing.	So where do we start?
What are you doing?	What does it look like I'm doing?
Wait.	What?
What?	We send the gold up what's to stop him from taking off and leaving us down here?
All right.  You go up, I'll send up the gold, then follow.	Yeah.  Yeah, that'll work.
What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?	We'll find our way.
No.	What do you mean no?  They can fly us home.
I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.  I'm glad it didn't come to that.	Yeah.  Well, me too.
Sorry.	Damn.
We can't just sit here.  We've got to start moving, so pick.	You sure you want me too?
I pick that way.	Okay.  Then we go this way.
Can you ride a horse?	No, but I figure now's a real good time to start.
Which way do we go!?	We go this way.
Come on.  You're going to get us in trouble.	It was an accident.  You saw it was an accident.
What is this?	Now you need me.
He says it's a box.	Yeah, you're funny.
And you're the guy who's going to open it.	I could.
God!  I don't believe I'm doing this.  I don't.	Yes!
If there's gold.  If!	You know what I'm doing with my half?
I thought we were dead.	Yeah, well, we're not.
How long we going to keep this up.	Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
So?	We have to do something.
You down?	Yeah, we're down.
What the hell are you doing!?	I think we found something.
No, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.	What's the matter with you?
What's this?  Why did you change it?	You've seen enough.
I don't know.	Don't go.
Then why did you bring it up?	I didn't.  You asked me about the card.  You're going to get us into trouble.
I haven't done anything.	Don't be so sure.
Look, food!	That's not food.  Can't be food.
What time is it?	What?
What are you doing?	I don't know.
They know.  They've been watching us.  I can feel it.	They don't know.
How far did you go?  Was it cold?	You have nothing to fear.  You're safe again.
I'm leaving.	What?
What?	Look!
What are you doing here?	I was lost.
Which way?	That way.
That's not it.	No?
I'm sorry.	What do you want?
So what were they doing here?	I don't know. You tell me?
What's up?	Where you guys at?
Good, now the other side.	Nothing.
What do you think?	Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
You got it.	We work fast enough for you?
Any word?	Nothing. Maybe they gave up, split town.
Then why tell me?	People are dying.
What is that?	Security.
Drop it.	Take him!
He is!	Look, it's important.
That's one more time than any of the rest of us have seen it.	Shit. We're fucked.
Nice to be here.	That feeling won't last long.
What's this?	Report on the case so far.
Do you know my first name?	No. What is it? Tell me.
And do you know what I'd like to have you do with that check?	What?
Ah, let me have a little fun.	Please! 
Oh, no, it's the way you lead.	No, madame, it's the way you follow.
Your bag?	Yes, my bag!
How much time?	An hour, two at most.
Holy shit.	Don't drop it Rose.
I told you you wanted to take this call.	Alright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?
I make my own luck.	So do I.
You know I don't like that, Rose.	She knows.
But I was with him the whole time.	Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.
You know somebody?	Of course not. That's not the point.  Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!
How you two doin'?	I don't know what she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along fine.
Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.	No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
The fall alone would kill you.	It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold.
HELP! HELP!!	I've got you. I won't let go.
Hello again.	Could I speak to you in private?
You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.	A mistake?
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!	He couldn't have.
You have to go for help.	I'll be right back.
Will this work?	We'll find out.
I'm not going without you.	Get in the boat, Rose.
You jump, I jump, right?	Right.
Rose, get in the boat!	Goodbye, mother.
I hope so.	That's a date. 
Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.	We'll save you a place at our table.
Could I see you a minute?	Sure!  Excuse me.
I'm so sorry!	Want to take it back?
A little.	Sorry.
What are you thinking?	A lot of things I'd like to forget.
I'll change and be with you in ten minutes.	Make it five.
Come in! 	Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
It's your deal.	It's a pleasure.
Here you are, sir. 	What'll I say?
Where do you live?	In New York.
I can see where I won't talk much to you.	Nuts to you too!
Yes.	Very serious?
How much did you lose?	About twelve hundred.
Yes, Yes!	You didn't have a gun in your hand last night?
There you are, sir.	Thank you.
I'm all right.	You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
Nothin'.	Let me look at it.
Listen, I want to talk to you.	Not now.  I don't have time.
He said to turn loose of him.	Well I'm not so go home.
Where'd you get that horse?	Beauty, ain't he?
Look, I don't want any trouble With you but that's my horse and I mean to have him back.  One way Or another.	Come and get him.
Forget it.	Excuse me?
How you feeling, Doc?	Better.
Maybe I ought to go out there.	You will or you won't.  Don't look To me.  I'm going to sleep.
You really look awful.	Not half as bad as I feel.
No.	What?
That was lovely!	You know you almost got us both Killed back there?
I have to go.	Wait!
I ain't your brother, I ain't None of your damn brothers.  Move!	All right, run 'em off.
What'd you do that for?	So he can tell the story.
How you doin', boy?	Fine.  Better.
Still, I do miss her. I only wish she could have lived to see all this.	I can feel your pain.
Wait a minute -	Get them out of here. If he says one word, shoot him.
Paris?!? What are you doing here?	Is that any way to say hello?
Oh, James. I've missed you -	Is this another one of your games?
Don't you even miss me? Didn't I mean anything to you?	Nothing.
Do you feel better now?	Do you?
Paris -	Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!!
Just - say it. Say it just once.	One thing at a time. I'll see you in twenty minutes. Go.
Do I have to do everything around here?	I hope so.
If I were you -	- You're not.
Wait here.	No. I'm going with you.
Not a lot of difference.	What do you mean?
Down?	Up.
Sometimes you just have to -	Don't say it.
Sleep well?	Next time, I do the driving.
What do you mean, you'd rather die alone?	I didn't say when I want to die -
Who's in charge here?	I am. What do you want?
Damn. It's doing it again.	What's wrong?
How is it now?	Seems to be back to normal, sir.
What is HE doing here?	I see you two have met.
Take the men. I can finish alone.	You come with me -  You stay here.
Oh, no.	Who is it?
Will it go off?	Maybe. Maybe not.
I pay my own way.	Since when?
Why in the hell didn't you help mama?	I told her I would if she would give me time.
I'll drive her to the hospital.	We will take her. You all stay here and watch Dad.
Why does he always pick on me?	He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.
You okay?	I'm okay. Go back to your friends.
Doesn't he look a whole of lot better?	Well, you look better than you did yesterday.
I don't want to wear out welcome, but you can stay in someone's heart longer than you can stay in their house. Come with us, boy. We are going to have a good time.	This would be a bad time for me to leave.
Your feet are cold.	Go back to sleep.
It's good to be able to hear that.	You must have been really sick.
What, are you having another party?	You better come sit down. You are still sick.
Since this morning.	What happened to your hand?
I have someone I want you to meet.	I'll be right there.
Harry, you know everything.	You got to know everything, do everything, and be everything.
As God is my witness, I have never done anything to that woman.	You must have done something to her.
There is something that I always wanted to know. Tell me, how did those boys die?	Now who are we talking about?
We can't really bring another family in here with us.	Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.
Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?	No, I haven't seen him.
I couldn't find my Buzz.  I know I left him right there.	Honey, I'm sure he's around. You'll find him.
Everybody say, "Bye, house."	Bye, house.
Hey!  Wow!	What?  What is it?
THAT is Sid!	You mean that happy child?
Buzz!  Buzz, come back!	Go away.
Well, thanks for the ride.	Look out!!
Hey!!	She's sick!
MOM!!  MOM!!	She's lying!  Whatever she says it's not true!
Wait just a minute.  What are you trying to pull?!	Nothing.
No!  No!  Don't leave!  Don't leave! You've gotta help us, please!  You don't know what it's like over here!	Come on.  Let's get out of here.
It's Sid!	I thought he was at summer camp!
Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY!	Sid!!!
This town ain't big enough for the two of us!	What?!
I want to go home.	Home is where the heart is.
I won't do it because he wants me to do it, even if I want to do it.	Do what?  Oh, I see.
Who's there?	Let me in.
You are cold. Where have you been?	I finished it off.
How long has -	All the time.
I already lost everything once.	So did I.
Even if that were true, they're not going to come to your house where you're waiting for them.	He's right.  They'll do it when you're walking somewhere, make it look like street crime.
What?  What is it?	It's very hard for me to come and tell you this.
I understand.  You're upset.  You want to know what's going on.  That's good.	Why are you talking like that?
Don't bother.	What?
I think she's lying.	Me, too.
Should we bring the police into this?	No, not yet.
About the other night, I'm sorry.	Me, too.
Did you meet the President?	Honey, your father knows the President.
Did you tell Dad?	Not yet.
Hi.	Hi.
How's David?	How's David? How's David? He's terrific, Carl.
Okay, young lady, that's it.	Like I give a fuck.
What is wrong with you?  What?  You're going away.  You're getting help somewhere.	You can't make me.
Private?	Yeah.
What are you doing?	Just watch.
What do we do?	I don't know.
What do you think she wants?	She's your girlfriend.  Open it, talk about your kids.
A group of us are going out tonight.	Who?
Somewhere safe.	Where?
Can you tell me anything?  Do you have any ideas?	I don't know what to say.
Hey man, I'm sorry.  I'm just trying to help.	You want to help?  Stay the fuck away from her.
I don't know, maybe we missed her.	I can't believe you used to bring my daughter here, to this place.
Did you tell him?	No. On you go.
I want the money, Mark, that's all.	If everyone keeps their mouth shut, there'll be no one going to jail.
Twenty thousand.	But it's not worth more than fifteen.
Calm down. You're not going to jail.	Easy for you to say.
What do you want?	Are you clean?
Tommy, let's put the tape on.	Now?
Are you getting out much?	No.
You take the test?	Aye.
What was your price?	Four Grand.
There.	Are you serious?
We go for a walk.	What?
I couldn't help but notice you pain.	My pain?
Don't tell them you're lost. You'll never live it down.	Is there a problem, gentlemen?
Admit it. We're lost.	All right, we're lost.  But we're making good time.
Your pain runs deep.	What do you know of my pain?
Oh, no. It isn't that. I knew I wouldn't die because the two of you were with me.	I don't understand.
You mean he's your brother brother?  You made that up!	I did not.
Is it possible?	Is what possible?
We must change our course at once.	I'll take you to the bridge.
Yes!	Let's get outta here.
Did we make it?	Yes.
What do you think?	Do it!
You think we can make it there?	We have to.
Where are you going?	Out.  If Dad doesn't care enough about us to be here on his birthday, then why should I care? I'm going to a movie.
I'm done.	Where are you off to young lady?
How was school today?	Fine.
Harry?  HARRY?!	What?
Thanks dear.	Here, check these out.
Son of a bitch!	What?
What?  It's on the way.  She says she's got something for me.	Yeah, right.
There's another guy, still in the car.	Stay on him.
Copy that.	And make it fast.  My horse is getting tired.
He's got it.	Sorry.
I should have gone to the police, I suppose.	But you didn't.  Why not?
Look, if you ask me everything twice, this is going to take a really long time.  And I have to get home to my family.	You're not going anywhere.
Well, what's the point of waiting?	I agree.
Yes.	Yes what?
Hi, honey.  How was the flight?	Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.
I'm late.	Me too.
I'm sorry.  Thank you for the party.	Yeah.  It was great.
I was in the area, and I thought you might like to have lunch.	They must've just missed me.
What?	Do you still love your husband?
What were you doing there?	You wouldn't believe me.
What are you going to do?	Go down there and kill everybody, I guess.
Not yet.  But we'll find him.	Dance?
Beat it.	No.  Soon as I turn you'll shoot me.
What?	Get going! 
Like one?	Fuck you.
Yes.  I suppose so.  Where?	The same place.  One o'clock.  I have to go now.  See you tomorrow.  Remember, I need you.
Did you read the papers yesterday?	Yes.
Tell me what happened?	I'm sorry, I can't.
Who is this woman?	His wife.
Did you get the letter?	What letter?
Not yet.	Nope.
That was so good I am gonna have another.	You can't have just one.
The letter I sent.	The letter he sent.
Has he looked through it yet?	Ya looked through it?
Tell him to look through it.	Get it.
Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?	Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.
Well, enough about the King. How about you?	How 'bout me what?
Ask me them again. One by one.	What do you do?
Like it?	Very much. Now, where were we?
What's wrong, sweetheart? Did I do something? What did I do?	You didn't do nothing.
Yes.	You will?
I do.	Thank you.
Where you goin', honey?	I just gotta get somethin'.
What?	Can you live with it?
Where the fuck is that bitch?	She's with me.
Money problems?	Now tell him goodbye.
That's a pretty amazing story.	Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?
How much of that letter was on the up and up?	Every word of it.
You're really in love, aren't you?	For the very first time in my life.  Do you know what that's like?
This shit can't be real.	It'll get ya high.
It's fuckin' real!  It's fuckin' real!	I certainly hope so.
What the fuck did you bring that for.	In case.
Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here.	Yeah, let's just get outta here.
Well, enough about the King, how 'bout you?	How 'bout me what?
Where's everybody else?	They'll be along.
Well, I guess it's about that time.	I guess so. Follow me.
Don't you?	No.
Wanna count your money?	Actually, they can count it. I'd like to use the little boy's room.
What do you want from me?	What?
Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.	I got some money I can give you -
That was very good.	Thank you.
You do more than try.	You do.
He knows.	How the fuck could he know?
You gotta hold this for me.	You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
Well?	Uh, what?
That's him.	What are you going to do with us?
You were in my dream just now.  Your hair was different, but I'm sure it was you.	We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours.  What was the dream about?
They're keeping an eye on me.	Who's keeping an eye on you?
Oh, Jesus, James!  You killed him!	I did him a favor.  Now come on.
You didn't have a gun before, did you?	I've got one now.
We need gas.	I thought you didn't know how to drive.
You smell so good.	You have to give yourself up, you know.
I don't have time to go upstairs.  The police are looking for me.  I need to know where it is and exactly what it is.	I get it!  This is your old plan, right?
But you know what's real now?	Yes, sir.
Nine thirty	Might be tight.
Hey!  You there!	You want something, old man?
Hey.	Hey, your . . . what the hell happened to you.
Goddamn you!  You son of a bitch!	There you go, sweet talking me again.
What you want?	Open up!
What the hell . . . oh it's you. Might've figured.  What do you want?	I want my car.
Jake.  I thought you would be at work, dear.	Who the hell is this!?
Who was that on the phone?	Wrong number.
What the hell you looking at, girl?	Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
What's the matter?	You didn't hear something?
Jake, what is that?	What does it look like?
Oh my God, Jake, no.  If it is someone they'll go away.  Or call the police.  Don't go out there.	What are you afraid of?  I'm the one's got the gun.  Stay here.
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?	I'm just going to my car.
No, I've got it.	What happened to your hand?
Thank you, John.	You're welcome, Grace.
Nice place you got here.	Thank you.
My face tell you all that?	It tells me what every face tells me.  Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
You can let go of me now.  I'm safe.  How do they look.	Like you.
All right, Grace.  No more games.	Games?
I think I can find my own way back to into town.	Maybe I like to find out about a man first.  Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
You never did answer my question.	Still playing?
Damn it, Grace!  Tell him.	If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true.
Shit!	It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.
Why the hell didn't you do anything?	What was I supposed to do?
Where's the safe?	I don't know.
Nothing.  There's no safe under here.	There has to be!
If you want.	We're going all the way.  Together.
Let's do it here.	What about him?
That's all talk.  He's got nothing on us.  He let you kill Jake.	Not me.  Us.
I shot him.	You killed him!
You're crazy, you know that!? You're fucked up!?	Just drive.
Is that the kind of girl you think I am?  What can I do to make you relax?	You could give me the gun.
Well, nothing.	Now what?
John!	Grace!
I can't make it.  Grace?  Grace!?	I'm here.
John!  Can you hear me?  Are you still there?	Where the hell am I going to go?
John, throw me the keys.	What for?
Who the hell are you?	I'm her husband.
What happened to your hand?	Accident.
Would you?	Would I what?
Good Lord.  What happened to you?	Just ran into a little trouble.
This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.	And tell her what?
Maybe not this time, but somebody's going to get dead around you.	No.
Yeah, well, me too.	Trouble with the car again?
I want to stay.	I said come on!
What happened to your hand?	Accident, and yeah, I got to be more careful.
Hey, Mister.  Mister.  I just. . . I just wanted to thank you.	For what?
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.	Get away from me!
I wasn't doing anything.	That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.	You expect me to believe that?
Mister!	Oh, shit!
Now, what's this?	Give it to me!
Saw you at the truck stop this morning.  You're not from around here.	No, sir.  And I'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
Hey!  You there!	You want something, old man?
You are crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old man.	You know I won't be seeing you.
I wasn't doing anything.	That's not the way it looked to me.  Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
Then maybe you should've. Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.	You expect me to believe that?
Mister!	Oh, shit!
Now, what's this?	Give it to me!
Who the hell is this!?	Who the hell are you?
Would you?	Would I what?
Next time you'll do just fine.	No!
I came for Grace.	You came to take my wife from me?
Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.	Get away from me!
What you want?	Open up!
I call the sheriff.	No! No police.
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?	I'm just going to my car?
Maybe, but if you didn't I think you would have kept on walking.	You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
No, I've got it.	What happened to your hand?
Nice place.	Thank you.
My face tell you all that?	It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?	Like you.
I think I can find my own way back to into town.	Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
You never did answer my question.	Still playing?
Oh yeah. It's far, it's another world.	Is it pretty?
I wanted to talk.	I don't think we have anything to talk about.
The money's right here! Get the key!	No! You get it!
Hey!  Take it easy.  Want to get us killed?	You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
You know I thought you'd left me back there.	What are you talking about?
Why?	I don't know why!
Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted to? What can I do to make you relax, baby?	You could give me my gun back.
Why's that?	'Cause I love you.
You got a beer?	What kind?
Who was that on the phone?	Wrong number.
What the hell you looking at, girl?	Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
What's the matter?	You didn't hear something?
I want to stay.	I said come on!
Is that the entire message?	Yes.
I'm listening.	I'll keep it in my office room.
I don't think I got the job in New York.	What does that mean?
I don't know. It's been a while.	I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
Is that what you wanted to ask me?	Yes.
What's he talking about?	In college. A car accident.
You forgot the "Now I'm going to tell you what the hell is going on" step. See usually that comes before the, "It's over" Step. And it always, always comes before the "You can go" Step.  What is over?	The life of an idea that has lived too long in my head.
Just give me a minute.	Is there a problem?
I have to go now.	One last question.
Yeah?	There's a message for you at the office. Your kid was hurt.
When?	Just now. They want you to come down to his school.
What do you do if something happens?	Get mom.
How many did you put on that time?	All of it.
I'm sleeping in my room.	I see.
I know now.	Know what?
That was me they were talking about. I almost died. That was me.	You're lying.
How are you feeling?	Okay.
Where were you sitting on the train?	Against a window.
Twelve years.	How did you get together?
No more sitting in this room. I've let it go on long enough.	I'm not going out anymore. I'm not getting hurt again. This was the last time. I told you.
Well, go get it then.	Where is it?
Where'd you get the money, huh?	We ain't got it. We ain't got no money.
He tell you where them others is?	Nope.
Some big guy beat the shit out of me.  I guess I must look a lot like you, huh?	You don't look nothin' like me, mister.
Three ways, I figured.	No.
You're goin' back with him?	He's my partner. He don't go, I don't.
Shit!	What happened, did you hit him?
When we gonna double back?	After a ways.
How long you gonna be, Bill?	Two weeks, I guess.
You was right to change your mind, Kid.	Yeah?
Jesus.  You done this before?	Plenty of times.
He's gonna die, ain't he?	Maybe.
Everybody I ever worked with, did time with.	They fucking know everything.
Why don't you just calm down'	What do you care what he says?
Roger really. People say I talk too much.	Yeah, I was gonna tell you to shut up.
What are we gonna do?	I can run. I got no problem with that.
Me too.	Did you hear what he just said?
What the hell do you want?	I wanted to talk to you. The other guys -
Get out.	If you'll just let me -
You have to come.	What's with you? What do you care whether I come or not?
They - They don't know me. You do. They won't take me unless you go. Look at me. I need this.	Tough break.
You watch your mouth.	Okay, okay. You say it's the real thing? That's cool.
I was out of line.	You okay?
We'll make it.	Don't do this. Send her a card - something.
Ready?	What time is it?
Better you hear it from me now than somebody else later.	Business or personal?
A little of both.	Ain't it a crime? Call if you're interested.
I wanted to. I thought we could make it.	Why didn't you say anything?
I didn't know. I saw him die. I believe he's dead. Christ	Why lie about everything else, then?
Nothing that we can do can make that woman well.	And no one will know the truth.
That's the call that I'm waiting for.	What does it mean?
I didn't do too well for you.	No, you did fine.
You sure you don't want me to stay on.	No.  No.  Thank you. You go home.
Yes.	Why?
What is it?	Thank you for seeing me.
Why don't you get some rest?	I've got to work.
Is it over?	No.
Thank you.	I have to talk to you.
I have to talk to you.	What do you want?
Okay.  What do you do when you don't have a witness?	You use their witness.
What the hell are you doing here?	We got to talk.
We just can't do it anymore.   This is our chance to get away.	I'm going to see you get that chance.
Hi.	Hi.  How are you doing?
Well, well, well.  Huh?	Yeah.
Shouldn't you be sitting down?	No, I'm all right.
Hello?	Did she hurt herself?
Could I ask you a couple of questions?	What for? Who are you?
Just let me talk to you.	What about?
Listen, what is this? What do you want?	I want to know who you are.
Will you have dinner with me?	Why?
I like that one.	No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
Okay. Now we're going to buy you some clothes.	Honest?
I don't like it!	We'll take it! Will it fit?
I wish you'd leave me alone. I want to go away.	You can.
You don't even want to touch me.	Yes. Yes, I do.
The trouble is, I'm gone now. For you. And I can't do anything about it. I want you to love me. If I let you change me, will that do it? If I do what you tell me, will you love me?	Yes.
No, I don't want to go. I want to stay here.	I need you.
I made it.	What are you going to do?
Will you tell me something? Has this ever happened to you before?	What?
Oh! Yes. Hello.	Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
Would you like some coffee?	No! No, thank you!
I hope we will, too.	What?
Would you like a drink of water?	No, thank you.
Where are you now?	Here with you.
No, I can't tell you!	What?!
Take me away from here?	Home?
No, don't go away!	Only this far.
You've been there before. You've seen it.	No, never!
Here with you.	And it's a all real.
There are things I have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. But they can wait. The only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe.	You can't.
You believe that I love you?	Yes.
Let me go into the church alone.	Why?
Oh, dear! Has she done something wrong?	Please answer my question.
Her car is gone.	What car?
From that music.	Oh!
Here, I'll show you what I mean. We'll start with this.	That!?!
Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it.	Stop kidding. Wait a minute.
Step number two.	Okay.
Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?	Do you know him well?
Here you are.	You haven't told me everything.
As a matter of fact, I thought I might give it to you.	Oh?
She died.	How?
Yes! That's it!	I thought so!
She's fucking hot!	I need a drink.
How ya doing?	What?
Don't even start.	You want to hear me out?
Wait!	What?
Stop it!	There's more.
Wait. Wait a minute.	What?
What is your problem?	I can't do this.
No way.	It has to be done.
I want you to hear me out.	What.
My god.	There's more.
So. When is the wedding.	Tomorrow.  We are getting married tomorrow.
She's not here.	Where is she?
Okay. Hi.	So who's the lucky guy?
Is everything okay?	Great. Fine. Perfect.
She's in there!	I'm just gonna let her know I'm here.
No I don't.	Fish?
But not tonight.	Not tonight.
Where do you look? What side of the neck?	Left side.
I got her arm.	Here's his head.
The past is the past. Today is the beginning of the rest of our lives.	Today is the best day of the rest of our lives.
What's your fucking point?	I'm not talking to you?
He just had two.	Give me two more.
That's right.	Isn't it a little late?
The hell I did!	The hell you didn't!
I don't hate women.	You hate women.
Stop it. I'm sorry.	You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
He just doesn't talk a lot.	Why? What's his problem?
Do you love me?	Of course.
We've got problems here.	Problems?
Hello.	Hi.
Hi.  Are you calling from jail?	Not yet.
Hello.	Hey. It's me.
Yeah baby. Everything's great.	Well, can you come back inside?
That means we get five hundred thousand to help raise the kids.	No.
Everything okay?	Yeah, Dad. It's great.
I don't care for him.	He's your brother.
I'll take a ride.	Go for it.
The first day.	What?
I'm thinking about maybe making a move.	A move?
There.	Where?
I think you'd make an excellent Big Brother.	That's what I'm thinking.
Smart. Smart. Smart. Think big picture, take your time. I wish I had.	That's our plan.
She's dead.	It was an accident!
Right.	That's right.
You see for me it's over. Over baby. I'm gonna turn myself in. After the wedding of course. After the wedding. Out of respect.	I don't think that's a good idea.
I'll come to you tonight.	No, the children sleep with me.
What do you mean?	Nothing. I didn't say anything.
How did you know about that?	Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?
You're lying.	No, it's true.  Last night when you were sleeping, I had you all to myself.
Think about it. Don't hurry. Think it over.	Go away! Leave me alone.
Let me pass!	You must listen to me before you go.
Leave me now. You can go to bed.	Yes, sir. Good night.
Sit down, I'm going to need your help.	What's the matter?
You believe me, don't you?	Yes, sir.
What will the lady say?	She won't even know.
Is it all right?	Yes.
It's very good.	Thank you; but it's missing something.
My God, what have you done to him!	He was asking for it.
What's the matter with you?	Nothing.
If you wake first, wake me up.	What are you going to do?
What are you thinking about?	That your cousin is more to your taste.
She isn't my cousin.	It doesn't make any difference what she is: you like her.
How in hell does it wind up?	I think I'd better go tomorrow.
Kill him.	That will teach you not to bother me any more, you son of a bitch.
He was very good. Better than some people would think.	Why did he kill himself?
I don't know, sir.	One shouldn't be alone the whole time.  I'm not like him, am I?
I don't know; I can't remember. But I'm sure he loved you.	Why?
I don't understand how you can like being alone so much.	I'm not like you, you have your wife.
What are you doing here? Get out.	Leave him alone.
Don't forget the meeting with the lawyer. The car will pick you up tomorrow morning.	I'll be ready.
It's for people!	Then let him go and he'll follow you.
How are you today?	Things seem to be getting better.
It's a very big one.	Very, very?
I hardly know him. I saw him only once, some years ago. I can't even remember him.	In any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
Good morning. You weren't expecting me, were you?	Mother.
Give the little girl to me. Come here, sweetheart. Are you ready?	When you are, miss.
Don't talk like that!	I'll talk the way I want to. I've had enough of this.
Hello.	Hello.
What?	Yes, yes, I saw you!
Jesus Christ.  Can you kill it?	If you can catch him.
Think you can do it?	Not from in here.
HEY!!!	Show's over unless I get to see what you've been working on after hours.
SID  NO!!!	What do you expect me to do, thank him?
I am beautiful, aren't I?	Of course you are.
You ready for this?	Don't worry. If I can't handle it, I'll just kill everybody.
I'm surprised you didn't write one about me.	I'm still working on it.
Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.	How did you get your hand out?
Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?	I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
Don't get out of the car.	Stop me.
What did you do to those people?	Nothing.
What's the problem?	I'm doing the best I can!
Whatever he was doing here was only the start.	Start of what?
Which way?	Both.
Nice work.	Thanks.
Find out anything?	A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.
Can I ask you something?	You mean there's something you haven't asked me?
What do we do now?	You won't want to watch. Turn around.
Yes.	Why?
What are we going to do?	The War is Over.
What's on your mind?	I have a question for you.
What is it?	President's speech.
The War ain't over. 	I saw it on TV.
Not bad for government work.  Having a good time.	Haven't had so much fun since Live TV.
Wake up.	Is he dead?
You can't tell this story.	Why not?
Another cup of coffee?	No, thanks, I'm nervous enough.
Hi.	Why?
But?	But he still has something Mark hasn't.
Then why do you still like her?	Like her?  I don't know if I ever liked her.  It's just you want what you can't get.
If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.	Who's is all this?
Anyone else not coming?	Right behind you.
Yes?	It's only two hours away.
That was very good.	Mom, I'm sorry.  I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
I miss you.	So much.
I didn't want to come.	Then why did you?
What's happening to me?	Well, that's what we're here for.
She said, "You know."  That I know.	Do you?
Of course.  You must be so proud.	I am.
How're you holding up?	Just fine.  It's a lovely party.
Norman was telling me the dream house is finally finished.	Almost.
I'm sorry?	I know how hard it can be sometimes.
Who?	Give me that shit.  Your wife.
Your house is so beautiful.	Thank you.
No.	Of what?  What were you so afraid of?
Love.	What?
Mrs. Frank?	Yeah.
Why are you here?	I don't know.
They're calling me in to work.	I should be going anyway.
You should have heard her play.	Stop.
How you holding up?	Good.  I'm good.
You think he killed her?	I don't know.  When you say it, it sounds crazy.  But what else could it all be?
Know what I think?	What?
Someone's there.	What?
Are you okay?	I think so
Okay.  Okay.	I've got to find a bathroom.  I'll call you.
I'm a terrible friend.	No.
How could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself?	What are you going to do?
How are you?	Fine.
You did a great job.  She's a good kid.	We did.
It's just us now.	I know.
Tired?	Nope.
Of what?	Of him I think.
Hi.	I'm stuck here for another couple of hours.
He killed her.	What?
Our house.	No.  Look!  In the window.
Where is she then?	She could be out.  She could be sick in bed for all we know.
See?	What am I looking at?
Keep your voice down.	I will NOT.
What?	Are you glad?  I'm glad.
I take it your not mad at me.	Wouldn't go that far.
She did it.	We don't know that for sure.
We have to get out of here.	It's alright.
What's that for?	Nothing.
I have seen him again.  Last night.	But you've not told Michael.
There is no one here but the dead.	Go away!  I don't want you here.
Something's wrong with you.	Nothing is wrong with me.  I know something's in there - and so do you.
I thought you were someone else	Well I'm glad I'm not them - what are you doing here so late? Come to that, what the hell have you got that for?
This must be one of the old keys -	Yes - I have had it for years.
I lost the touch	The touch?
What are you doing?	I'm sorry?
Sugar?	Yes, one and a half please.
Do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed	Why should I feel sorry - they're dead.
You think I killed my MOTHER don't you?	Did you?
Where are you going?	Out - I may be some time
Why did you let him in?	What was I supposed to do?
I don't like sugar	There isn't that much - you didn't even taste it - What's wrong - don't you like my tea?
I want you out now	Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?
It's been what, three years?	What's this all about?
Sugar?	Yes - one please.
Check this out.  Hurry!	I better go, Dad.
Hurry.	What is it now?
I get it now. You and me. We're dead.	Dead?
Never say never.	Oh, god.  Look. Look.
You guys are my parents.	Of course we are.
Son.	Well, why should I?
Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted? It's in your blood.	I always knew there was more. I felt it.
Ted! Do something!	What do you want me to do?
If you could just sign right there.	You want it in writing?
Where are we going?	To the best hiding place in the world.
I can't believe your dad built this for you.	He didn't. He had it built.
That's probably my office.	Well? Where the hell are you?
Well? Surprised?	What is all this? When are you coming home?
But who would run the store?	Forget the store. Think big.
You do like girls, don't you?	Of course I like girls.
Truth is, I'm a little nervous.	YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
I told you you could do it.	I was like a different person tonight.
I owe it all to you. Without your help I'd be lost.	I wish I knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up.
Oh no. No way. I've had all the bad news I can take for one day.	It's about your parents.
You look pretty.	Thanks.
You come all the way out here to watch Walter?	I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
You okay?	I'm fine.  Nice TV.
Guess I kind of lost it there.	You could say that.
At that point were you able to fight him off?	No.  He stopped by himself.  Okay? That's all.  Let me go.
He did say something.	What was that?
This wasn't my idea.	I'm sorry?
I can't believe you called Sam.  What's the matter with you?	I'm scared, that's what.  I'm scared there's no one to trust.
You're gonna fuck me over, aren't you?	Oh, for Christ's sake.
What are you looking at?	Nothing.
Don't forget the car wash.	I won't.
Jesus Christ, what are you doing?	So you got my mom's money.
How much?	About six and a half million dollars.
God, you scared the shit out of me.  You must be crazy coming here.	Of course I'm crazy.  Ask my mom.
Hello?	Hello.
No.	Will they?
But she ran away.	That's right.
What?	That was the same thing Ray said.
I've seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man Van Ryan hadn't fucked you out of it.  What if I told you I had a way we could get a big piece of it back?	We?
But don't pull that again.	Wouldn't dream of it.
What was all that back there?	All what?
At least I tried something.	Hey, I tried the board.
If you don't mind my asking, were you always the way you are?	What way is that?
Oh, damn!  That's it.	It's better than nothing.
What's this?	Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
Damn, I wish this thing would go faster.	Relax.  We're almost there.
Excellent detective work, sir.  You should have the honor of going first.	Oh, thank you.
It was in your book.	Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.
You didn't tell us you had this on!	My Lord, he was telling the truth!
A new friend?	We'll see.
My.  It's gotten longer.	You bring the best out in a man.
Your private train, sir.	Private train?
Mr. President, good to see you again, sir.  Sorry about all that.	That'll be all, boys.
Are you all right?	For the moment.  But I fear not for long.  I'm of no use to him now.
Now it's a bomb.	It is?
Well?	They're coming.
Thank you, friend.	Let's go.
You!  Are you the mother of that child?	No.  I mean yes.
I can't.	Let me see it.
I can't.	Why not?
I do what I'm told.	Too bad you're not more like your father.
You're a fool.  Now put her back.	I'm not going to let this baby die.
Why did you say that?	Say what?
Because it's true.	I don't believe you.
Then you get us out of here.	I will!  But I need help!
What's that?  I hear something!	You hear trouble.
You gotta promise to feed her.	I will.
You!!	Where the hell did you come from?
Because she's sick.	Because she's sick.
Where's the baby??	I thought you had her!
Did she ask about me?	Who?
She's in love.	You're crazy.  I think you're in love.
Kill him!	No!
I'm not going in there.	Me neither!
She needs to be changed.	I changed her already!
How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company	Sorry. It's important.
I saw him.	Who'd you see?
Don't let them hurt you.	I won't. Now run.  Fast as you can!
Who else knows?	Just us.
It's all over, Paul.	Move! Or you die right here!
What was that?	He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you.
Your sister said you don't have a family?	No.
Where are you taking us now?	Home.
Anybody know about this?	I didn't even know about it.
It's me.	Johnny! Where the hell have you been?
You hear me?	I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
You know where he is.	Wrong.
You admit you're lying?	I admit I don't know where he is.
Did you find him?	Not yet.
Everything okay?	Yes, thank you very much.
Who was that man?	His name is John Book.
I am not a child.	You are acting like one!
She say where he is?	I don't think she knows.
He's not in this building.	All right, where is he?
He'll live.	You might have killed him!
Get back in there.	My son is out there!
I don't want to stay here.	They are English. They don't understand.
Oh!  Come back!  Don't go without me! Please come back!	I can't come back!  I don't know how it works!
Oh, yes - you - you wanted to go home, huh?	Oh, no, I wanted to go along with you.
Tomorrow?  Oh, but I want to go home now.	You've had plenty of time already!
I've got a plan how to get in there.	Fine.  He's got a plan
Where do we go now?	Yeah.
No, sir!	No, sir!
That's right.	We do.
Oh, did - did you see that?	Oh - look out.
Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!	Oh!  Well, what happened to you?
No, you don't.	Oh, no!
It a message.  He wants us to know he back.	Who?
He was my father.	I sorry.
I can stay.	I know.
What the hell are you doing here?	Someone wants to kill me, I rather die looking him straight in the eye.  What are you doing here?  Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?
I could have given you the world.	Not interested.
Was this all about the oil?	It is my oil!  Mine and my family!
Warm.	Is it?
This is the end.	No.  It is the beginning. The world will never be the same.
Any word from him?	Still no contact yet.
His what?	His . . . whatever.
This'd better not be what I think it is.	Okay!
What's he doing?	I think he's going to the john.
He saved himself.  He changed the past.	Where did he go?
Their real names, please.	I don't know their real names.
New information.	Ever see one of these before?
Is that all?	Just remember, I'll be watching.
Just about anything I want, it looks like. This is gonna be tough, though. There's no way to save this game. I gotta get it right the first time through.	What do you get if you finish?
Where are you going?	Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
Hey, you're good.	Maybe we should start again, yes? I know so little about you, except that you're not what you say you are.
They tell me you're an American agent.	What are you talking about?
Are you alright?	What the hell are you doing? You could've killed me!
Where are we going?	We're getting out of this place. We've done enough.
Where'd the damn truck go?!	Go to the water, it's that way!
Nothing. He had two days.	Perhaps he is not all he says he is.
Sit down.	I've been on a plane for twelve hours, I think I'll stand.
I'll leave you two alone to talk.	Yeah, thanks a lot.
Dude, what are you doing here?	You killed me, remember? Now I have to hide out here with you. Where have you been?
Sorry, "dude".	What's the deal?
Help me with this guy.	It's like you said, every man for himself.
What's this?	This is a gift. From me to you.
I don't believe it! You can't shoot a cop in the middle of the street!	Had to do what I had to do.
I wish I could go.	We all do.
I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.	Were you now?
Let go.	Suit yourself.
Don't you knock?	They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
I lost him.	How?
Is that what you're looking for?	A piece.  Only a piece.
I'll find him.	ALIVE.
If I could make you understand.  If you could just be made to see it the way I do.  The way it's going to be.	The way what is going to be?
Give him an extra dollar.	Yes, sir.
I will!  Goodbye, darling!	Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye, darling.	Goodbye, darling!
Darling!	Darling!
Surprised?	Surprised!
Ready, darling?	Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
Good night.	That's my good boy.
How long will this whole thing take?	A week.  Ten days at most.
There.	I beg your pardon?
Home!	Home.
But what you were doing?	Just putting up some tea.
It seems that way.  You didn't hear any music at all?	What?
What is this place?	Must be the music room.
Taking the book along?	Yes, I think we could all use a good laugh.
It's not enough.  More!  More, do you hear me?	What?
How's it going?	What did you find out?
Come on, big fellow!	Is everything ready?
Are you busy?	That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?
Oh, doctor!	Perhaps we'd better leave.
Oh, Doctor!	I think you've done it, master.
It looks that way.	What do you think we should do?
Do you think you can sing it?	Me?  Sing?
Did you do it?	I think so.
Good night, Doctor.	Good night!
Yes, I have mine.	And I have mine.
Yes, I know.	It wouldn't be fair to her.
No, not sound.	There must have been someone else down here then.
I'm getting tired.	Why don't we all turn in?  It's been a long day.
How long is it so far?	Four
Yes, sir, name, please?	Food!
Do you think she might be interested in  someone?	Which one?
